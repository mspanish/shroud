The conception that the Manoppello is actually the original Veronica has been first suggested by Pfeiffer around 1990, and quickly dismissed by several ‘authorities’ in the Shroud world, such as Ian Wilson (see article “Rome, Italy. Jesuit professor claims ‘discovery’ of the of the Veronica’ from BSTS #50 http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n50part1.pdf ). Other resaerchers were also sceptical about this, for example Roberto Falcinelli (see http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/roberto.pdf and http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Falcinelli Manoppello Web.pdf ) Here is, in my opinion rather conclusive proof that Falcinelli, Hesemann, Wilson are wrong the Manoppello is Veronica. According to Pfeiffer, it is also Image of Camuliana, and he has several good arguments to support this thesis (see http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Pfeiffer Web.pdf ). Why for example Wilson is opposing this? Because actually, the Manoppello is game changer! It is another undesirable factor, that needs to be included in Shroud research, providing fascinating solutions to some problems, but also creating a multitude of others. The whole Wilson’s Mandylion theory has to be seriously revised for example there is another candidate (besides the Shroud) for this role.

Hesemann assumes that because Manoppello looks (on some photographs) like a painting, it must be a painting, which is wrong, becuase it is definetly not any classical painting. He also claims that Manoppello (measuring 24×17 cm) is too big for old 34×31 cm (Falcinelli claims 31.7×29.5, Badde 32×28 cm, virtually everyone claims different dimension) Vatican frame from 1350. But the outer edges of Manoppello were cut by father Clemente da Castelvecchio in 1608! So the dimensions are different! This also explains why Campin’s Veronica Veil is larger than Manoppello. Sorry, your arguments should be presented in an article or paper, not in bits and pieces with links. Actually what I presented is not my origianl idea. It was alredy presented in the books by Badde and Resch long ago! But, like many other information about Manoppello, have been virtually ignored by some wise guys knowing better! Before I forget, why the big difference between what is seen in Manoppello and the face attributed to Campin? This second face is more like what we see on the Turin Shroud. I see no such big difference. Open eyes, serene face, long nose. Brown hair… It may look like the Shroud, because of dark skin, but this is due to the painting technique it is hard (and missing the point of an artist) to paint a pale, hardly visible face on transparent cloth.

But what about the teeth and beard, different from what we “see” on the Shroud face? There seems to be evidence that the Manoppello veil was re touched with pigment, however that does not make it a painting. A similar thing is said to have happened with the Guadalupe Tilma and Callahan said that we would have to wait for the pigment to disappear. Here I don’t know what you mean. Of course they are different, because the Shroud image has a different nature than Manoppello. But there are quite convincing studies that both images represent the face of the same man.

Blandina Paschalis Schloemer has also published large format (and large price) album with comparison between Shroud Manoppello Oviedo, suggesting they both show the same face. See also the work of Fanti & Jaworski, (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/jaworski.pdf ) giving additional corroborate evidence that the face of Manoppello and the Shroud represent the same person (although, contrary what the paper’s title may suggest, the Manoppello has no 3 D characteristics comparable to the Shroud, Jaworski nad Fanti simply use the 3 D processing as additional tool for comparative analysis).

I suppose Wilson had understood it (and the threat to his hypotheses) and that’s why he twisted his argumentation in his 1991 Holy faces, Secret places. We can say with very high confidence that the Image of Edessa brought to Constantinople in 944 was actually the Shroud (the more I read confabulated relations in “Story of the Image of Edessa” by Porphyrogenitus, the more convinced I am). Nevertheless the question remain: was it the same cloth that was brought to King Abgar 900 years before? They say Mandylion showed only the face. Fine, then look for the cloth that shows only the face. Because of various set backs, military and natural, the superstitious Byzantines saw the need to hide and conceal the cloth under an imperial covenant with God, which was only broken late in the 12th century, when the full image was again revealed.

As persistently stated by Yannick from many years ago, there is not one Byzantine scholar who accepts Wilson’s theory, and I have been slow to accept that, until Markwardt’s paper. Yes. And why should we care about that? As I have shown in this post https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson shroudies vs academia another guest posting by o k/ those scholars will never go beyond their very limited horizon of their imagination (which they do lack, as well as the basic knowledge of the Shroud, as well as fundamental ability to weight all the facts and draw reasonable and sensible conclusion). Edessa may have been copied from Camuliana. Is this the only possibility? You say “Look for the cloth that shows only the face” That seems to me an inference to the Manoppello, which is not the Shroud. Yes. But is directly linked to the Shroud, as I have shown in my humble presentation: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/addendum manopello shroud comparison3d.pdf The Mandylion is reported as being sent to King Louis of France after 1204, and later destroyed during the French Revolution. Was this the same Mandylion that was brought to Constantinople in 944? Was this the same Mandylion that according to the legend was brought to King Abgar circa 30 AD? Nothing here is that simple as those narrow minded Byzantine scholars would like to think. The Mandylion was always deemed to be a face Yes. The question is: why? and yet from after the discovery of Camuliana, we have full length images in illustrations and crucifixes and banners. The Camuliana was brought to Constantinople in 574. The Image of Edessa was rediscovered in circa 544 or shortly before. So the connection with Edessa is just as plausible as with Camuliana. I think Markwardt gives an adequate explanation in his Antioch paper referring to the conversion of Abgar VIII the Great, (not Abgar V), and that may well have been the Shroud which Bishop Avercius Marcellus had temporary custody of from Antioch. It finds an echo in Bardaisan’s contemporary Hymn of the Pearl. Markwardt does not give facts, only another hypothesis.

The story appears to be a borrowing from when the true Shroud was rediscovered in the walls of Antioch as a consequence of the earthquake there in 544. Antioch is the natural apostolic home of the burial cloths. Dave, I think you take Markwardt’s claims too uncritically. Whatever he states, you take it at face value. While my opinion is that Markwardt’s historical essays although containing a lot of interesting informations are based not on solid evidence, but on mere speculations, developed about some minor episodes, developed in quite novelistic fashion. Thus they cannot be considered without a lot of reservations. There is not a slightest indication, slightest document giving as clue that the Shroud was ever in Antioch. On the other hand we have clear testimonies about Image of Edessa being rediscovered in 6th century. We have good reasons to suppose that it was actually the Shroud (further on). The Image of Edessa was always only ever claimed to be a face, and remained so until well after 940. How then could 6th 7th century iconoclastic Byzantines then produce crucifixes, images of the crucifixion, and upper torso icons of Christ, based only on a facial image? Unless perhaps someone knew the true nature of the cloth at that period (memory of which was apparently lost in the iconoclasm period). And I am quite certain that in 944 the Byzantine court knew the true nature of the cloth, but trying to avoid theological scandal, they tried to conceal it. Besides, you don’t need to know the whole image to produce crucifixes. They migh have appeared naturally, without the knowledge of the Shroud. Further there are Byzantine pre 940 references to the Image of God Incarnate, and yet as far as the Byzantines knew, the Edessan cloth was only a face. And there is no indication that the Image of God Incarnate (aka Camuliana, aka Veronica, aka Manoppello, according to Pfeiffer) was anything else but just the face image. Markwardt knew Pfeiffer’s (and Badde) stance, nevertheless he rejected it, pursuing his own imaginative scenario, and dropping the key element (Manoppello) out of the hands. It seems to me you would have a stronger case for the Mandylion becoming the Manoppello, which may in fact be your position. Yes. But not exactly. I have stated many times here, that the Mandylion has never been a single object. Just look at the propsed routes of both relics, Manoppello and the Shroud:Both cloths are candidates for being the Mandylion. And I believe that both cloths actually were the Mandylion, in different historical periods..","date":"2015-02-18","mins":"5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"id":"comment-191380","author":"o_k","post":"Dave B: I am terribly sorry to say so, but your are WRONG, on several issues. Scavone’s Document IV refers to a letter of Constantine VII to his troops in 958. The particular relic is variously described as The Image of Camuliana, The Image of God Incarnate, and the Garment that God wore. There is no reference at all to link the Image of Camuliana with theofórou sindónos. Scavone does not write about that! Furthermore, there is also no indication that Image of Camuliana contained something else but the face. The Mandylion was claimed to be “painted in choice colours” which does not fit a description of the Shroud image, and as yet there are no grounds for presuming that the Manoppello is anything but a painted image. Oh, really? Have you read this? http://manoppello.eu/eng/index.php?go=badania Have you checked my paper: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/addendum manopello shroud comparison3d.pdf Where is the paint? No matter it looks like being “painted in choice colours”, it is not a painting made by any technique we know. How do you explain the correspondence with the Shroud? There are serious grounds to consider it acheiropoietos, just like the Shroud. However Markwardt in his recent paper also refers to similar incidents occurring in the 6th 7th c. When Christ’s image was used for military palladia, and showed at least the upper torso. Documentary evidence, please. Markwardt’s speculations does not interest me. I recall that Scavone (still apparently a supporter of the Mandylion theory) gives citations indicating that the “Image of God Incarnate” did include a body image, but fails to recognise that this cannot apply to the Mandylion. There are no such citations in Scavone’s paper you linked. After attending to securing the church in Antioch against Chosroes, Bishop Ephraim suddenly departed on a mission to Cappadocia when he might have been expected to stay and rally the populace. On his return to Antioch this is not held against him but he continues in his role as Patriarch, it must have been an exceedingly important mission. It does not prove anything. I suggest that you endeavour to read again Markwardt’s three conference papers on the history of the Shroud in detail including the citations, “Ancient Edessa and the Shroud”, “Antioch and the Shroud”, “Modern Scholarship and the Shroud”, setting aside any preconceived ideas, and see if you can come to a better conclusion. I have read them. And there are no arguments there that would convince me that Markwardt’s heories are anything more than speculations at best, if not just historical novels. Markwardt examines Wilson’s Mandylion theory in considerable detail, and identifies the reasons why it cannot be sustained. The only reasons why it cannot be sustained, are conformism and cowardice of those so called ‘historians” who are not ready to admit that it may be (and probably is in general account) true. That’s why they invent thousands of really trivial problems, just to debunk it at all cost. You know what I must truly say this, even if it may sound brutal. You are really uncritical about Markwardt. You blindly accept whatever he says, but most of his papers are in fact, nothing else but mere speculations without solid evidence, although presented in a nice way. When you look at them with a more critical eye, you will see that they actually add little to our direct knowledge of the Shroud. The number of citations does not reflect the actual value of the paper, really it may even be used to mask actual low content of the article. Markwardt actually copied most of his recent ideas from Pfeiffer, (often through Badde books). Yet what is sad, he seemed to be too much opportunistic to follow Pfeiffeir’s ideas. As frustrated Badde writes, there seems to be some fierce opposition against Manoppello, even among (or perhaps especially) Shroud scholars. They are afraid of another “miraculous image” on the horizon..","date":"2015-02-19","mins":"8:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"id":"comment-191216","author":"o_k","post":"They perpetuate the Wilson hypothesis of the Image of Edessa being the Shroud.

Here is the photo my hand: The corresponding distance is exactly 11 cm as well (check the ruler). The begining of the scale is in the presumed nail exit, and it is clearly in the wrist. Conclusion: as my hand seems to correspond closely to the hand of the Shroud Man, and the distance of 11 cm from the end of mine finger joints leads to the wrist (one example is enough to demonstrate that), we can say that the nail exit is in the wrist just as both the look on the Shroud and forensic analysis indicate.

But this is not the case here. Actually you can determine the shape and dimensions of hands very precisely if you take effort to make very precise measurements, and use imagination a little bit. That’s how this work is done. The best way of locating the position of the wound is at the wound site itself, using a sufficiently clear image of the outline of the hands. It may be noted there that the blood smear of the wound extends from where the metacarpals of the thumb and fifth finger converge at the wrist carpals to just beyond the junction with the radius and ulnar.

In this way you insinuate to the bystanders, with whom you are in good repute, that what your opponent says is nonsense. Thus, when Kant’s Kritik appeared, or, rather, when it began to make a noise in the world, many professors of the old eclectic school declared that they failed to understand it, in the belief that their failure settled the business.

This is a trick which may be used only when you are quite sure that the audience thinks much better of you than of your opponent. A professor, for instance, may try it on a student.

It’s not reasoning that is important here ,it is LOOKING at the Codex and trying to work out what influenced the illustrator Guess what? in this case a Hungarian working in 1195 at the height of a Crusade fever in Hungary when his king had just taken a vow to go on Crusade. There is no direct link between this and Pray Manuscript whatsoever. At least you cannot prove that. Besides, those illustrations are considered to be older, dating to circa 1150s.

And if not, the HPM is enough to prove existence of the Shroud before 1195 showing that 1988 carbon dating cannot be trusted. If it was on the Codex, it would only tell us that the Shroud was in existence somewhere that the Hungarian might have known about, east or west The most important think is that it was in existence before 1195 – and so before 1260 1390 claimed by 1988 C14 dating. It doesn’t say where, but… more likely west Less likely. What indicators do you have for West? None. And for the East you have several documents showing the presence of alleged burial cloths, most notably Robert de Clari’s mention of the sydoines with the figure of Our Lord on it exactly like on the Shroud of Turin. So possibly early medieval, certainly a time when relic cults of this kind were very popular. And when were they not popular? That does not get us much further.

Extremely unlikely.

Some aspects of the HPM are more certain than others when comparing to the Shroud. E,g. 1. There are certainly missing thumbs on the HPM and Shroud. 2. It is uncertain whether or not the HPM depicts a tomb lid with a zigzag pattern or whether it is the Shroud with its herringbone weave. How do you go about weighting these perceived similarities when calculating probabilities? It seems to be highly subjective and not amenable to this type of comparison. No, it works in different way. I take into account only the facts beyond any dispute on the HPM. So thumbs are certain. The question of whether HPM presents tomb lid, or the Shroud, is actually irrelevant to me (BTW, Ian Wilson thinks it is a lid).

We are sure that a number of copies of the shroud of Turin are genuine. All them without exceptionpresent the characteristic shape of the Turin Shroud. But the HPM is not a copy of the Shroud and its image but simply a psalter with several references to the Shroud! That’s the main difference you seem not to understand. We have also an alleged influence of the Turin Shroud on a number of images of Christ. But you intend to base this influence on some features common to medieval art. The problem is why they are common in medieval art. This matters the Vignon markings issue, for example (which base on frequent congruences with the Shroud). But for the case of HPM, it doesn’t matter the establishment of direct relation between HPM and the Shroud is based on peculiar (and thus infrequent) congruences with the latter. You mix the two different problems. It is you that affirm (inconsequently) that the features that matched the altar and the Shroud were common in medieval art. This claim is mine also. See above. – There is not a L shape in the “holes” of the codex Pray. There are a L form and a P form. You can not find this combination in the Shroud. Of course, I can find. But those P holes on the bottom red crossed rectangle do not interest me at the moment. Just L holes. – It is not evident that the small circles are holes. The same form is used in the codex Pray to the ornaments of the dresses. It is enough to me that they mayrepresent holes on the Shroud. The alleged shroud in the codex Pray is not a shroud; it is the sepulchre. There are several reasons that show this. There is one reason which disproves the allegation of zigzag patterned rectangle being sepulchre. See http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/8435/kj41.jpg There is clearly visible a bench on which angel is sitting. Thus the rectangle cannot be a tomb lid. Whenever I show this, every sceptic plays fool and tries to ignore it under any pretext. A large frequency of congruences in History of Art indicates a style or an iconographic rule.

Your complains about the names have absolutely no impact on the case. Bravo! When reality discredits me, the reality doesn’t interest me. Well said about yoursef, David Mo! P holes are out of the game. Whether red crossed rectangle is a marble, or another part of the Shroud, this does not exclude the possibility of influence of the Shroud on Hungarian Pray Manuscript. So I simply do not take P holes into account. The Reign of the maybe is infinite, but we are searching for the truth not the imagination. I suppose. And the truth is based on better or lesser evidences, not on vague possibilities. Those possibilities are compelling enough, to take them serious. The opposite thesis (the HPM has nothing to the Shroud) is also a “vague possibility”. But as I have shown extremely unlikely. O.K.:There is clearly visible a bench on which angel is sitting. Thus the rectangle cannot be a tomb lid. DM: Why not? The angel seated on the lid or on the sepulchre by pointing the finger to the folded shroud is a usual representation of the Holy Women scene.

In regard of the other features noted by you, we can search for randomly different features in other paintings and we will found also “astonishing coincidences”. Sure.

There are many more coincidence with the Shroud in the HPM then only A F I chose only the independent, and most compelling, which are very rare, and hard to explain otherwise. This is not the case of the altar of Lübeck, on which coincidences found are more “common”, although it still can be influenced by the Shroud in some way (and I suppose it indirectly is). And I remember you that there is not any L shape in the Pray Codex. There is a pair of L+P. It is a significant difference. I don’t think so. There is clearly L shape circles, the same as on the Shroud.

I insist the unique feature clearly shared without any ambiguity by the Shroud and the Pray Codex is the nudity. Very poor evidence to counter the evident dissimilarities between them. There are no dissimilarites which would exclude the HPM Shroud link. As to ambiguity of interpretation of other marks it is not so important.

Just to quote IW (The Shroud: Fresh Light on the 200 yeart old mystery, Bantam 2011. On the radiocarbon dating: pg. 21 22: In 2005 American scientist Dr Ray Rogers, dying from cancer, issued a peer reviewed scientific paper claiming to prove that the Shroud sample used for the carbon dating was cut from an area rewoven during the Middle Ages, instead of having come from the true, original fabric. But as we will see later, even this argument lacks serious substance, and in general the 1988 radiocarbon dating finding has been able to rest unchallenged as science’s overriding ‘verdict’ on the Shroud, snuffing out any evidence, from any discipline, that might suggest to the contrary What counterarguments Wilson presents against Rogers? As we will see, none (he mentions Rogers only twice in the whole book!), but let’s make another quote from his book. So now this ‘trash’ chapter 7 ‘What’s in a date?’ pg. 129 130. More recently it has been claimed, […], that the area of the Shroud from which the radiocarbon dating sample was taken was one which had been extensively rewoven in the Middle Ages (footnote 9 : Marino and Benford 2009). Purportedly the ‘new’ areahad been invisibly matched to the rest of the cloth, so the radiocarbon dating laboratories had unwittingly dated from a piece that was not part of the original cloth but added thirteen centuries later. Thirteen centuries here is ne clue that Wilson completely misunderstands Benford/Marino ideas. But he goes further: Despite this idea having been put forward, even in peer reviewed scientific journals, it has little more going for it than the ‘clandestine switch’ theory. During my eight hour examination of the Shroud back in 1973, high among the priorities was a very carefu search fo any anomalies that may disclose an early historical display method, any ancient fold marks, signs of fastenings, etc. Every area of the linen’s surface that was accesible on that occasion (footnote 10: The dorsal half was not, being above my head, because of the upright display mode) was carefully surveyed from a glancing angle for this purpose, and the area from which the radiocarbon dating sample was later taken was well within my viewing range.(footnote 11: The opposite end of the cloth was not, being well above my head because of the upright mode of display on that occasion.) Not theslightest sign of any compositional difference was apparent. Later, Wilson goes on bringing Vial’s and Flury Lemberg opinions. Anyway, as we have seen, he prefers his own eye examination, back in 1973 (!), when no one had C14 dating on mind, over peer reviewed articles in scientific journals. And later Wilson is going on, describing generalities, how C14 is unreliable, without any proper understanding of the subject. He as far as 2009, despite his visual examination, considered discredited bioplastic coating theory as credible, and believed its presence in the C14 area (see pg. 135, and a footnote 18, that is an e mail from Stephan Mattingly, dated 8 April 2009). About Danin, Marion, Courage and Castex, pg. 376: When none other than Avinoan Danin, Professor of Botany at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, very forcefully insist on seeing the images of certain plants(footnote 13: Danin et al, 1999 and 2008.), it deserves to be taken seriously particularly given that he can in no way be accused of any pro Christian bias. Most other such claims, however, are extremely doubtful, particularly the Latin, Greek and Hebrew inscriptions which have been ‘seen’ by two French researchers, André Marion and Anne Laure Courage. (footnote 14: Marion and Courage, 1997.) Also the claims of a French ‘scientist’, Thierry Castex, that he has found the Aramaic word ‘found’ written in Hebrew letters. So Danin is fine, but Marion, Courage and Castex are not. And Castex does not even deserve the name of ‘scientist’. Very gentle, Mr. Wilson. Oh, btw: what is in the Wilson’s bibliography? Marion, André, and Anne Laure Courage, Nouvelles Découvertes sur le Suaire de Turin, Paris, Albin Michel, 1997 In fact, I have a polish edition of that book? And I can say, that it is quite technical, for a popular book standard. Here I have question: had IW even read it? Because I have sense that either he had not, or he had not understood it at all. This is the only place where he adresses Marion and Courage saying simply they are bad, without any adressing to it in essential way. It is not about agreeing, or not, with Marion&Courage conclusion, but I am under impression that Mr Wilson had lost a great opportunity to remain silent on the subject (that he probably doesn’t know at all).

No. My article shows a different approach, approach that no sceptic has been able to undermine. I assumed that there is no direct connection between the HPM and the Shroud, and all similarities are random coincidences. Then I tested this hypothesis. It turned out that the chances that all the similarities A F are simply random coincidences aree NEGLIGIBLE. So the conclusion of every reasonable person would be to reject that hypothesis. The HPM is based on the Shroud with estimated 99.9999 % significance that is beyond even the most strict criteria. Of course sceptics want to deny this but they can’t. They are not interested in arriving at the truth of the matter, but simply in DENIAL.

The sceptics logic goes more less in the way: large number of Three Marys scenes show the angel sitting on rectangular slab from the tomb thus the similar rectangle in the HPM must also be a slab.

There is no obligation here. Similar with Charles Freeman’s Holy Sepulchre oculi and L shaped holes in HPM. As well as other ad hoc ‘explanations’ by the sceptics.

But it was more fun watching you paint yourself into a corner. But you haven’t , neither then, nor now. Some advice: never multiply probabilities, even fanciful plucked out the air ones like yours, unless you are absolutely certain the events are independent. Or have at least no reason to suspect they are dependent. But the features (“events”) of the HPM you cite are almost certainly non independent, given (a) it’s just one carefully selected artist, not a random selection and (b) the work of a poor draughtsman, one who inserts one obscure or ambiguous feature after another into his illustrations (e.g. A lid/door/(rigid) shroud), is likely to introduce others too (stepped pyramid pattern, angel sitting or standing, enigmatic head, enigmatic letter/symbol, and notably those L (and P) shaped circles) that were singled out for attention initially, elevating the HPM to its totally undeserved celebrity status in sindonology. Your attempt to ridicule those features has no basis, Colin. Even if the artist was drunken while drawing, and projected his delirium fantasies, it does not change the fact that there are Shroud like features in the HPM! So those many features you list are not “independent” events.They are characteristics of a carefully chosen ‘outlier (statistically speaking) with serial instances of artistic vagueness (at least to the modern eye). You had no business multiplying your (fanciful) probabilities together. They are almost certainly non independent. Of course they probably are not independent as the HPM was almost certainly based on the Shroud, then they cannot be independent. But if we consider opposite hypothesis that the HPM is not derived from the Shroud we can treat them as independent. And multiply them as independent probabilities.

And as they were unknown, we can model them with random occurences of each feature A F (that is naked Christ, no thumbs visible, and so on). And as they are random and independent (what may be dependency between naked Christ and L circles?), we can estimate the probability of the coincidental occurence of them all at once which clearly shows that it is astronomically unlikely. And that’s the point. Counting points of congruence to build a case for causation is statistically fraught with hazard unless one gives equal weight to points of non congruence. Sample sizes of one (HPM) do not assist one’s case either. 1. There are no non congruences which would exclude the hypothesis that HPM was based on te Shroud. 2. A sample. We estimate probabilities based not only on HPM, but on several other medieval illustrations of death and burial of Christ, as well as Empty Tomb scene.

Just another peculiar similarity with the Shroud, one can add to registry. And estimate frequency of their random occurence. I also think the whole picture has been trimmed to make it fit the Codex, which explains why Jesus’s feet have been cut off, and possibly the angel’s wing the other side.

This is why the aspiration to deduce imitative effects only on the basis of isolated features is doomed to failure.Because an individual feature can be similar to other only by coincidence, But this is the main point, that you still don’t understand! The chances for coincidence of so many so rare features, are simply negligible! especially when it is defined vaguely and one rejects the contradictory elements of his interpretation as you and other sindonists do. They are precise enough to connect them with appropriate elements of the Shroud. And HPM’s “contradictory elements” are only in the sceptics imagination. You paraphrase, proclaim or affirm but never explain anything. If you pretend identify some object X it is necessary to identify the definitory features of this object, what identifies it as an X, not claim some vagueness as “seem to serve no other function”. Two lines are enough for a simple representation of a bench, especially in the very obvious context of this illustration. What “function serve” the lines in the back of the angel? Are they similar to the Pray Codex? I don’t know what lines you have on mind, and it has nothing to the different illustration in Pray Codex. New mistake. Some of us have explained here that the medieval artist does not guide himself by the Bible lecture but by the artistic conventions of his time and the iconic narrative. Who cares what guided a particular artist by? Was he obligued to do anything, because David Mo 800 years later orders him to follow some artistic conventions (which he likely was not even aware of) in his primitive cartoon? You try to complicate in extremely sophisticated way a matter that is very simple. There are numerous rare congruences with the Shroud? Yes.

You took some effort to search for illustrations with 4 fingers. Besides that a few of your examples do not pertain, you only strenghten my case (you fell into the same trap like David Mo and other sceptics before you). None of your illustrations show all 6 key features present in the Codex Pray. The more such illustrations you provide the stronger the case for the Codex Pray being unique and witness to the existence of the Shroud before 1200 AD. It’s not up to the critics to disprove you, it’s up to you to prove your case, which means going through the relevant manuscripts and icons and finding the general tendencies. If you can show that there is no iconographic tradition that has Jesus depicted in such and such state, then you can proceed to whatever calculations you can do This is is the part of the job you sceptics have done for me. By providing numerous illustrations that don’t have those 6 key features. I repeat: the more such illustrations you provide, the stronger the case for the Codex Pray being unique. But let me point you in just one direction. That Jesus is naked pretty much implies that his hands will be crossed over his pelvis, for obvious reasons. But not the other way, the crossed hands do not imply nudity. And nudity is the key feature here, not crossed hands (maybe I didn’t explained that in the article clear enough). On all of these images from different eras, including very modern images, the thumb is either barely visible or absent. Why? Because you selected those images. Now when you took such large effort (I admire you for that) answer your question yourself, what is the proportion of illustrations with 4 fingers vs 5 fingers. So here’s one potential correlation, which would leave you with only 2 traits, because then nakedness and 4 thumbs are not necessarily independent. None of your illustrations show full nudity like in the Codex Pray. Why 1 in 100 and not 1 in 20? It doesn’t really matter whether 1 in 20, 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000. The point is that the chance for randon accumulation of so many scarce traits, similar to those spotted on the Shroud, is really negligible. And whether its final numerical value is 1 in 1000, 1 in a million, or 1 in a bilion is not important, the conclusion is important. Versus the fact that the second image shows a tomb lid separately from a shroud.

Together with the legs, the angel’s wing, text above, etc. The fact is that the legs are indeed cropped there. This is undisputed coincidence with the Shroud. We don’t bother about any possible alternative explanation for the presence of key traits A F. The very presence of rare non trivial coincidences with the Shroud is important here. The folio is trimmed, I agree. I saw this long before you joined this discussion. But it is irrelevant here. It is of course possible that the crop of the legs is merely accidental. But this could have been as well deliberate decision of the illustrator who put the legs on the very margin to be cut while trimming. So the point C is still valid. “Because you selected those images.” I didn’t really have to try hard to select the images, most are from the first Google Image search pages. But in any case that’s hardly an answer. Why is the thumb absent or barely visible on the images I selected? Because you have selected those images with invisible or hardly visible thumbs. You have admitted this here. Thus the whole your reasoning is invalid, as you introduce bias by selecting the images that favor your claims. Besides lack of thumbs is something different, much stronger than “hardly visible thumbs” or thumbs obscured by geometric perspective. There is no obvious rationale for portraying 4 fingers on the entombment illustration in the Codex Pray, except that illustrator desired to do so for some reason. Nudity is correlated with crossed hands, that’s a fact (because nudity needs to be covered – and if not with a cloth, then with crossed hands, unless we imagine some Austin Powers like visual devices which surely weren’t in use back then ;) ). And it seems that crossed hands are correlated with 4 fingers. So it seems that nudity is correlated with 4 fingers and thus cannot be treated as an independent variable. This whole reasoning is obviously wrong. Your own illustration shows why: Here we have crossed hands, yet no nudity, as the loincloth is clearly visible. And there are 5 fingers visible on each hand. Remember correlation is not the same as implication, although they are related. And implication can go either way, but not necessary both. Nudity implies crossed hands (to cover genitals) of course, so there is correlation between nudity and crossed hands. But crossed hands does not imply nudity nor 4 fingers.. Oh, but it does matter. E.g. 10^ 3.9 may be small, but it is still much better than 10^ 6. (Not that I would agree with this number for the reasons outlined above.) But 10^ 3.9 (close to 1 in 1000) is a small number, even if two orders of magnitude larger than 10^ 6. It is close to null and that’s the main point. The odds for finding 6 tiny features that reasonably coincide with the Shroud just by chance is remarkably small. Small enough to reject it by any reasonable criteria.

But they are in fact different. While upper image shows tomb lid, the similar image Pray Codex shows the Shroud.” This is incorrect, since the similar image in Pray codex can only show the tomb lid, as I have shown through comparative analysis with numerous other contemporary miniatures. And I can show with numerous other fish photographs that dolphin is a fish as well. Once again: crossed hands don’t imply nudity, but nudity does (with huge probability) imply crossed hands. So you giving me an image of crossed hands without nudity does not in any way address my argument. There seems to be no argument at all. Besides, the whole discussion is pointless as nudity and crossed hands are in fact listed as one point (A, and in fact complete nudity is primary feature there). “But this could have been as well deliberate decision of the illustrator who put the legs on the very margin to be cut while trimming.” LOL? Of course such possibility seems to be beyond your imagination… Any probability calculation [that assumes that the rectangle is the Shroud, although it is of course the tomb lid] *must* account for the absence of the image on the “shroud”… No, it must account only for those features which are considered relevant to the subject, and not some other unimportant details which neither imply relation with the Shroud nor deny it. Even the lack of body image on the purported Shroud does not say anything, as one can give plausible explanation for its absence assuming even direct relation between the Shroud and the Codex).

A) The author did not provide any justification for his probability estimates. The author makes a rough estimation of probability assuming plausible order of frequency for each feature 1/100 for the simplicity of calculation. Whether actual frequencies are in fact 1 in 45 or 1 in 136 are largely irrelevant as the actual values, even if possible to determine, would hardly change the actual conclusion. Besides the author gives the very high limit (10 milion) for the actual number of relevant medieval illustrations (estimates for total number of all medieval manuscripts oscillate about a few millions), thus likely overestimating the final number achieved. B) The author did not provide any justification for treating his probabilities as independent, which can only be established through actual statistical research of the contemporary iconography. The author sees no evidence for any correlation, nor for any plausible connections between discussed features. For example, there is a probable connection between nudity and 4 fingers (a nude figure will almost certainly be exhibited with crossed hands, and there is an abundance of images from different eras with crossed hands which lack thumbs; The attempts to show the connection between two features based on the biased, selective sample have no grounds. 2. Substantial grounds: a) The author claims the cropping of Jesus’ feet as a significant coincidence with the Shroud of Turin, yet there are two facts that undermine this conclusion: a1) We know that as a rule medieval manuscripts had very wide margins, because the scribes knew that their books would be rebound and trimmed several times in the next few centuries. It is thus extremely improbable that the current very narrow margins are the original margins, give or take a few mm. A2) We know that the Pray codex *was* trimmed, because it has some marginal text neatly cropped, which means that the manuscript as a whole did undergo this standard treatment. We cannot determine the original size of the relevant sheets in the Pray Codex. The fact that the text on the upper edge of the codex is cropped is irrellevant as height and width are two independent dimensions. B) The image has to be interpreted first and foremost in the light of the contemporary iconography. As the Codex Pray is unique with its exceptional Shroud linked features, any comparisons with contemporary iconography are baseless. The exceptions defy the rules by definition. This is the basic logic. The contemporary iconography allows for no other interpretation See above. Contemporary iconography cannot be applied for a single very specific example which may go against it. C) The author’s claim that the pyramid like pattern on the tomb lid refers to the herringbone weave pattern is false, because it looks nothing like the actual herringbone weave pattern, which looks like a series of parallel straight fish bones. The interpretation of zigzag pattern as an attempt (even if inaccurate) to portray herringbone pattern is fully justifiable. The author’s claim that the tomb lid is actually the Shroud of Turin is also refuted by comparing the top and the bottom pictures on f.28: the top picture shows Jesus’ shroud, which, with its numerous folds and without any pattern, looks nothing like the rigid patterned rectangle on the bottom image. The difference between representation of the Shroud on top and bottom pictures of f:28r is irrelevant, if one takes into account other contradictory represenations in the Codex. For example f:27 shows Jesus crucified in traditional Byzantine style implying 4 nails used, while there are only three nails on the arm of the cross hold by an angel on f:28v: http://mek.oszk.hu/12800/12855/html/hu b1 mny1 0060.html http://mek.oszk.hu/12800/12855/html/hu b1 mny1 0063.html e) The author only takes into account what he thinks are convergent features, while ignoring the divergent features in his probability estimates. These divergent features include: There are no features that would exclude the hupothesis that the Shroud of Turin is referenced in the Codex Pray. E1) Lack of the image on the alleged shroud. Irrelevant. If illustrator decided not to portray the image on the Shroud for some reason, he had the right to do so. Demands of the skeptcis 800 years so about what the illustrator should and what should not have portrayed are lacking any basis. E2) Lack of the actual herringbone pattern on the alleged shroud. Same as above. E3) Lack of the corresponding pattern on the second half of the shroud (which is actually a depiction of the sarcophagus). The second rectangle on the lower image is irrelevant as it is hard to interpret what it represents. I have never claimed that it has to be the other half of the Shroud. E4) The different number of circles on the two alleged halves of the shroud (4 and 5). See above. E5) Lack of wounds on Jesus’ body. Irrelevant (see description for e1). E6) Jesus’ hands are crossed at the wrists (or even above them), not at all like the hands on the shroud. This sentence makes me laugh. Mr Historian, just look at the later copies certainly derived from the Shroud of Turin: http://greatshroudofturinfaq.com/History/Western European/manycopies.html The position of the hands is exactly the same as in the Shroud of Turin. Conclusion: The main conclusions remains valid: *There are no element that would exclude possibility that the Shroud of Turin is represented in the Codex Pray. *The coincidental appearance of so many peculiar elements connected to the Shroud on the f:28 of the Codex Pray is so improbable, that can be rejected by any reasonable criteria..","date":"2015-03-06","mins":"1:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-192594","author":"o_k","post":"Skeppy Thankfully, I never claimed to be a historian. ;) Yeah, coming here you never intended to be a historian, especially proffesional medievist, right?

Contrary: He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. Is 53:2 (NIV) Based on this verse, some of the Church Fathers maintained that Jesus was looking ugly, he was lame, unattractive and so on thus he shouldn’t be portayed. They argued that not his look, but his message is something one should concentrate on. Only later the approach was changed, as it was understood that this verse depicts Christ during His Passion. Hugh: Only later did the long edges acquire a slant of their own, and the shorter edges, sometimes but sometimes not, become vertical. And the question is WHY? Remeber, there were strict rules in painting icons, and no room for experiments. Other interpretations of the suppedaneum is that it is a balance (sheep up – goats down). All those interpretations are most likely later inventions, trying to give answers (and some theological meaning) to principal question: WHY?

My hand being bigger than the Shroud’s, I multiply this by 1.1 to get 121.8mm. On my hand, this takes me exactly to position N3, and not the wrist. As I said before, a single measurement here or there cannot be used to define a position, because an overall match is needed. You need to measure all your own phalanges, compare them to the Shroud’s, multiply the Shroud measurement by any necessary correction factor, and then find the position of the wound on your own hand. I very much doubt you will find your positions very different from mine. On the contrary, on my hand I don’t find my positions very different from what I see on the Shroud, the distance of 11 cm from the end of proximal phalanges leads me to the wrist area, exactly where Zugibe indicates. Your hands are perhaps slightly different, yet comparing with mine (and without using complicated method you described) the results are satisfactory. Dave B: I already did at Feb 23, 5:24am. Why should I repeat myself? Measuring along the hands is useless and Oskar has fallen into the trap of repeating the error. No one knows what the angle of the hand is to the surface of the cloth, and no one knows the length of the phalanges or other related physical attributes of the TSM, nor whether the fingers are cupped. I also mentioned other aspects. Yet we can give quite reliable estimate. The sheet probably followed the surface of the hand quite tighly, as roughly constant intensity indicates (remeber about distance intensity correlation), so the margin of error due to projection is likely to be negligible. We can also get a good guess about the endings of phalanges (as they are marked by slight growth of intensity).

The publications on Manoppello are usually exaggerated in either way, that’s why it is hard to get balanced and unbiased view on it. But what I want to stress, the Manoppello cannot be ignored, contrary to the temptation of many Shroud scholars. So how many times do you think that Jesus left his image on cloth? Once on the veil, the second time on the Shroud? It has been suggested that Manoppello had been laid on TS, see http://www.sudariumchristi.com/uk/tomb/byssus.htm There are also claims by Fanti and Maggiolo about ‘double superficiality’ of the front TS image, and Jakcson’s ‘Collapse Theory’. So, speaking theoretically, there could be more clothes, shrouds, and napkins with the image of Jesus upon them. Perhaps some radiation created some changes in the byssus yarns… but those are mostly wild speculations now. There is no mention of Veronica in the Gospel, just what can be reasonably be interpreted as a burial shroud. Of course there is no mention of Veronica in the Gospels, and there is no evidence such legendary encounter, but the origin and evolution of the legend is a very complex matter. See Massimo Centini’s Alla ricerca della Veronica for example. There are stories about some miraculous images of Christ (or faithul represantations of how He looked like) circulating since the very early centuries of Christianity. And perhaps based not only on a single prototype. Did you see what Phil Dayvault found in Turkey? In your view is that mosaic similar to what we can extract from the face on the Shroud or does it comes closer to what is seen in Manoppello? I don’t know what you have on mind. For some cappadocian paintings , see http://manoppello.eu/eng/index.php?go=kapadocja It is hard to tell whether those paintings were based more on the Shroud, or on the Manoppello (assuming they are both genuine). That’s why many scholars, ranging from Wilson, would prefer that there is no Manoppello. It solves some problems, but complicates the situation enormously. For example the strand of hair, the most prominent feature, is present on both TS and Manoppello. There is not one, but two possible prototypes and how to distinguish which is which in some cases? But in some others, it is possible. Remember, there were two allegedly miraculous Images of Edessa, and of Camoulia (Camouliana).

I recommend reading Zugibe’s article once again, then maybe the doubts will be explained. ONE: The thumb (radial) side of the wrist i.e. The area of the wrist opposite Destot’s Area. The nail could pass through the radial (thumb) side of the wrist through a space created by four other carpal bones; the NAVICULAR, LUNATE, GREATER MULTANGULAR and CAPITATE bones, emerging where the Shroud depicts it. This is a very strong area and the trunk of the median nerve would most likely be damaged by this path. TWO: The upper part of the palm of the hand … NOT THE MIDDLE OF THE PALM. This area is equally as sturdy as either Destot’s Space or the radial area indicated above and would emerge at the site depicted on the Shroud. This area is located as follows; touch your thumb to the tip of your little finger. A deep furrow called the thenar furrow is seen at the base of the bulky prominence extending from the base of the thumb. This area was first pointed out by Monsignor Alfonso Paleotto, Archbishop of Bologna, who accompanied St. Charles Borromeo to Turin in 1598. It may be of interest that he postulated that the nail would have entered the upper part of the palm obliquely, and pointing toward the arm, it would have emerged where the Shroud depicts it. It is of interest that Barbet severely criticized Paleotto’s hypothesis as “anatomically impossible.” Monsignor Paleotto was indeed correct. If a nail is driven into this furrow, a few centimeters from where the furrow begins at the wrist, with the point of the nail angled at ten to fifteen degrees toward the wrist and slightly toward the thumb, there is a natural inclination of the nail to an area created by the METACARPAL bone of the index finger and the CAPITATE and LESSER MULTANGULAR bones of the wrist which we have coined the “Z” area (Fig. 5).","date":"2014-04-11","mins":"8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed"},{"id":"comment-98377","author":"o_k","post":"Barbet vs Zugibe 0:1.","date":"2014-04-11","mins":"11:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed"},{"id":"comment-98419","author":"o_k","post":"Well Hugh, what would you say for that: http://tiny.pl/qnb8b http://tiny.pl/qnb8z I wouldn’t be so sure that hitting major blood vessel is so impossible.

Second: Wilson’s reconstuction, is just only a HYPOTHESIS, and he (Wilson) always claimed so, as far as I know. Most probable IMHO, but it doesn’t mean that I uncritically accept it at all points. Third: Yes there are many possible tracks. The problem with Shroud history up to 1350 is not lack of recrods, the real problem is that there are TOO MANY records, that allows for multiple tracks, how the Shroud possibly came from Jerusalem circa 30 AD to Lirey circa 1350. For example, my own book written in Polish by medical doctor Stanisław Waliszewski, assumes recontstruction based Pietro Savio’s 1957 work, which in my opinion is too archaic for now. It says that the Mandylion was distinct from Shroud, which was the Arculf’s shroud from 670. Fourth: There are definetly many other interesting relics. What is regrettable, they are very often absolutely forgotten in English speaking world. For example Tunic of Argenteuil, it was already shown in 1934 (and once again by Marion in 1997) that blood (type AB!) marks on the back of the Tunic match the wounds of the Man of the Shroud. But who in the English world has ever heard about that? I live in catholic Poland, and in recent years, there were several books about other Christ’s relics than Shroud and Sudarium, and connections between them. But why to accuse Wilson that he “diverted attention from other leads”? Every track is competing with others. But in one instance I can agree, in 1991 Wilson in his book Holy Faces, Secret Places destroyed interest in the Manoppello Image in the English speaking world, despite that he present in his book multiple arguments in favour of its authenticity (which were later presented again by Badde, Gaetta and others). That’s his greatest sin I think. Fifth: Wilson isn’t perfect, I agrre. No one is. Truly I can’t find a single Shroud researcher without a sin. Everyone committed some errors. But I can’t understand such hostility against Wilson. Why? Because he is famous and well known? Jealousy? I don’t know. Sixth and the point: As I read Yannick’s posts, it is absolutely obvious to me that he has some obseesion about Wilson. No matter what the topic is, always, Wilson,Wilson, how bad greedy, awful that Wilson is! This is really an obseesion, it needs some kind of therapy, I don’t know. Everything to destroy Wilson and his Mandylion hypothesis. Personal vendetta, no doubt. I ask why? What has Wilson done to you, my dear Yannick, that you hate him so much?

Some have challenged some points (mainly with the same speculative arguments used by Wilson, Scavone and others). Last comment: It’s so pathetic to see people becoming blind when someone is showing them proofs that contradict their preconceive notions about something that it makes me sick. Yes Yannick. I have read your paper. And I am preparing to refute it, point by point. In my opinion, no point is a deadly threat to Wilson.Several are simply the same argument, repeated again and again. With screamings: “If Wilson’s hypothesis is correct, WHY is this so ???” Most if not all of them, have already been answered in Wilson boks, just to read them again. I don’t have to give absolute proofs WHY this is so. Just plausible explanations, that keep the Wilson’s hypothesis still on the surface. Remember: lack of proof for one thesis, DOES NOT PROVE THE OPPOSITE THESIS. And as I said, Wilson’s theory is just theory. With some modifications, the one that makes most sense in my opinion. Of course you can disagree. I am from Poland, and I have written several articles about the Shroud for one of the Polish apologetics portal. You can see them here, Google translates them quite faithully into English: http://ok.apologetyka.info/ I have even gave a link to your article in one of the footnotes. When I come to write an article about the early histry of the Shroud (so far I end it at around 1200 in Constntinople), I will definetly mention and discuss your points. And as to Wilson, I will add one thing. Yannick, you wrote:”Remember that Wilson is not a professional historian.” I would say (forgeting for a moment that the guy graduated from Oxford): FORTUNATELY! You know why? Because from my experience, if I can be honest, most of the professional historians, historians of art, and especially biblical historians, are ignorant, blind, close minded, and most importantely conformist IDIOTS (of course there are some noble exeptions). That simply follow the tide, no one can move forward with brave, fresh ideas, that goes against the highly authorative society, who made their names by kissing the three letters of their predecessors. It concerns not just the Shroud, but many other issues also. You wrote: “Such a bad manner to perform historical research have contributed a lot to discredit Shroud research (including the few serious Shroud researchers out there) in the face of the scientific community, who, because of Wilson and many others, see sindonology as a big joke.” I want to tell you what I see as obvious truth: for most of the so called “scientific community”, we, the guys who are interested in Shroud research, we are simply pseudoscientic maniacs, of the same sort like those who search for UFO, Yeti or Atlantis. That is true, and that is why the Shroud is considered to be on margin of “serious scholarship”. Despite that usually the level of knowledge of those “serious scholars” about the Shroud is absolutely NULL. Why? Because the Shroud research is politically incorrect. It can shake the basis of our society. And if, for example, Wilson’s hypothesis one day is proven correct, this would be absolutely Copernican Revolution in Byzantine History, and Byzantine Art. That is why the concrete is obviously against it. They would lost their authority and their works, their papers would be nothing more than a trash. That’s I think, everything I have to say in this discussion.

Even if it was in Edessa, he thinks that it had been moved back to Jerusalem by 550, and the Mandylion is a distinct cloth. Waliszewski then claims that the shroud was moved around 1050 to Constantinople, and later, in 1247, brought to France by Philippe de Toucy. He also mentions Conrad of Krosigk, and Nivelon de Cherisy, who brought parts of the burial cloths from Constantinople after the 4th Crusade. What is very often overlooked, is possibility that there may have been MORE than two burial cloths in the Jesus’ tomb,not just the Shroud (of Turin) and Sudarium (of Oviedo). There could be several other cloths, perhaps even TWO burial shrouds (sometimes people were buried with two, or more). Savio Waliszewki theory may be used as an alternative to the Wilson’s, but I give more credibility to the latter (with several modifications). Yannick, of course, you can have a different opinion. I think the Shroud history may be much more complex than anyone (including Wilson, Savio, Yannick, Charles, Dave and me) imagined. As I said the problem with Shroud prehistory is not that there are no records, but that there are too many records. It may be misleading, forces us to reject some of them.

You have noted that Wilson is selective, and concealed several things. Right. But also Wilson’s critics are selective, and truly, they don’t understand the point. Remember, it is not because of Wilson the “Academia” does not take Shroud serious. No. It is because of prejudice of Academia.

Because it is beyond their imagination, that any relics of Christ may have survived up to this day. And in some ways, the Shroud studies are similar to UFO or ghost studies. They are also on the verge between natural and supernatural. And no serious scholar would risk his/her reputation being involved in research of supernatural.

There were two, the so callled Image of Edessa, and Image of Camoulia! See this page: http://manoppello.eu/eng/index.php?go=start Now back to Edessa. I want to say something that most of the Shroudies never concerned. The Mandylion was not a real object. It was an IDEA! It never existed as a SINGLE OBJECT! No. There were several objects that played the role of the Mandylion. I believe the Mandylion transferred to Constantinople in 944 was the Shroud. But this was not the Abgar’s Mandylion! It was The Manoppello Image! The COLOURFUL image of JUST THE FACE, that looks like A PAINTING! It was later lost, rediscovered in Camulia (which was a town near Edessa) and the Shroud (which was transferred to Edessa at later period, possibly around 200 AD and rediscovered in 525 or 544) took its place!

There are many problems with this concept, and I said that I prefer Wilson’s theory over it. I just presented it to show that Image of Edessa theory is not the only one possible (and its opponents like Yannick, may be interested in some alternatives). I consider Savio Waliszewski theory as quite obsolete. Savio’s book (which I don’t have ) is from 1957, while Waliszewski, who is extensively using it (remember he was/is medical doctor if he is still alive, he must be over 100 years old), wrote his book in 1987 (just look at the national borders ; ) So; 1.) Waliszewski, like many older scholars, believed that the Shroud had been gradually shortened over centuries, while its part had been cut and sold as relics. Now, after Dickinson, and cubit measure of the Shroud, we know that this idea was wrong. 2.) Waliszewski (this time following Wilson) thinks that the Shroud perhaps was transferred to Edessa (about 200 AD) and discovered (as a Mandylion) in 525/544, but then immediately transferred back to Jerusalem, as an Arculf’s cloth. Is there any document supporting transfer of the Shroud to Constnatinople circa 1050? No. I don’t know any documents speaking about it. Waliszewski assumes that the transfer took place before Seljuks captured Jerusalem in 1073. However, we know (letter from Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos to his army) that burial linens were already in Constantinople in 958. 3.) Waliszewski qutes Savio that there are no records of transfer of the Shroud or Sudarium to the West following the 4th crusade. We know however, that this claim is incorrect (see Besancon hypothesis) He also mentiones Nicholas Mesarites speech of 1207, at the burial of his brother, suggesting that the Shroud is still in Constantinople. Then he mentions Conrad of Krosigk, and Nivelon de Cherisy, Hugo de Cambrai, and also Robert de Clari, who took back home some fragments of burial linens. Then he goes to Baldwin II who sent another fragment to Louis IX in 1247. We know now, however, that this fragment didn’t came from the Shroud of Turin (see Cesar Barta article: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n56part5.pdf ). We can be certain that there were multiple burial cloths in Constantinople in 10th 13th centuries.He assumes that the Shroud itself was brought to France by regent of the Latin Empire, Philippe de Toucy, around 1247. 4.) One of Philippe de Toucy’s descendants was Jeanne, first wife of Geoffrey. According to Savio and Waliszewski inherited the Shroud from her. One of the canons from Lirey, Wulhelm de Baserne was also relative of Philippe de Toucy. I have read Scavone and Markwardt’s articles, thanks. As I said, I prefer Wilson’s theory over Savio’s. I believe that the Shroud was in Besancon circa 1208, but I am critical of Scavone’s explanation how it passed to Geoffrey..","date":"2013-08-27","mins":"9:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"id":"comment-52534","author":"o_k","post":"Max, it happens sometimes, I don’t know why..","date":"2013-11-23","mins":"3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/23/hugh-farey-on-the-possibility-of-image-color-under-bloodstains/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Hugh Farey on the possibility of image color under bloodstains"},{"id":"comment-52559","author":"o_k","post":"In Fig 8 1, most of the red particles are found in the top right part of the picture.

Surely it has has made physicians very impressed by the accuracy of those wounds, allowing them to make very detailed descriptions of injuries suffered by Shroud Man. The article of Sebastiono Rodante on this topic is a must read: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi01part5.pdf Some interesting quotes: “It is necessary to differentiate between puncture wounds caused by a thorn which was implanted in a blood vessel of the head and afterwards removed; and a wound from a thorn injuring a vessel and remaining in situ for a certain period of time. In the first case, there is the issue of blood (arterial or venous, according to the type of vessel injured) until, by the coagulative process at the point of the injury (inside the vessel and in its walls, as well as in the injured cutaneous capillaries)—until a clot forms and therefore the bleeding toward the exterior ceases. In a healthy organism, in which the coagulative factors are normal, this process takes place in a few minutes. Instead, in the Crucified of the Shroud, the crown of thorns must have remained implanted on the head for a certain period of time, either before the crucifixion or during the hours in which he remained on the cross right up until death. In this case, each thorn remaining in situ blocked the issue of blood onto the skin to some extent, depending on the calibre of the perforated vessel. But the spasms of the forehead muscle, contracting because of the pain provoked by the injurystimulus on the sensitive nerve endings and making the infixed thorn move, kept the thornwound open. If the injured vessel was a vein, there was a determination of blood in a slow and continuous flow, helped in its course by the movements of the wrinkling forehead. However, the perforation of an artery of a certain calibre (such as the frontal branch of the R superficial temple artery), by its own arterial pulsation caused movement at the point of perforation.” I would still like to know the basis for your earlier claim that the blood wounds are homogeneous. From you or anyone else. Continued silence means the evidence isn’t there? A contrario, can you give us evidence that those wounds are homogenous? If so, which ones? David Mo: The opinion of these “prestigious” physicians about blood stains is counteracted by the opinions of other “prestigious” physicians, either independent or not. The opinion or these “prestigious” physicians is refuted by personal experience of wounds and the pictures of blood trickles (two of them resented in this forum).

Sorry, but this chapter is actually a trash, really. Unfortunately 20 years after dating Wilson still didn’t understand basics of carbon dating, nor specifics of that particular 1988 dating of the Shroud, nor the idea of reweave hypothesis by Benford, Marino, Rogers and others, and stuck to the old and long refuted concepts. Joe: Although I believe the evidence is very strong that there was reweaving in the C 14 area, that doesn’t preclude having my opinion that because of the unique nature of the Shroud and the problematic nature of C 14, that the test probably shouldn’t have been done. What’s so unique in the Shroud with regards to the carbon dating? We tried it once, unfortunately we came across interpolated sample, the results were not satisfactory, we had bad luck, it happens, sorry. Why not try once again? But this time with wiser, transparent approach, no blind tests. Remember , to skew a date from 1st to 14th century we need 66 75 % non original material (a simple calculation). That’s really big amount! If we don’t hit unlucky area again (and if we take more than one sample from different areas, we shouldn’t) the results should be 1st century or close. The carbon dating is not so unreliable as they paint it, actually it is more foolproof than fool vulnerable. It’s ridiculous that one questionable test is given so much weight. As I explained above, it is the only serious non authenticity argument. And fanatical anti authenticity desperately needs anything, even a failed scientific examination as the “proof” that the Shroud is a fake. That’s also why I would like the carbon dating repeated. Let it turns 1st century, then I would like to see their mugs. Hugh: The argument that C14 dates are often wrong and that therefore radiocarbon dating cannot be relied on is ilogical and untrue. Agree. I, on the other hand, would stake several dollars that any new radiocarbon test would confirm a medieval date. I would rather put it this way, there is a good bet that the results of another C14 test would be entirely different than those obtained in 1988.

Even 1532 fire shouldn’t have great effect, as it affected only a few areas and there is no evidence for some large interchange of carbon atoms with enviroment! As several people at the conference pointed out, if another C 14 test was done and didn’t come out 1st century for whatever reason, the case for the Shroud’s authenticity would effectively be over. And if otherwise, the Shroud’s authenticity would be hard to deny! Let the sceptics be flat Earth believers! We know what went wrong in 1988. All we have to do is simply not to repeat those mistakes. There were many opportunities for the case of authenticity of the Shroud to be over. Had STURP in 1978 found significant traces of paint, the case would be over. Had there be image below blodstains the case would be over. Had there been brushstrokes, the case would be over. Had the bloodmarks proved to be pigment, the case would be over. And so on. Remmeber, the first blood tests in 1973 were negative (this is used by sceptical propaganda up to this day)! Only improved tests from 1978 showed them to be real blood. That’s why I opt for repeating carbon dating. I don’t believe it will turn 14th century once again. Simply I know that 1988 went wrong, I know why it went wrong, and the odds that such unfortunate accident will repeat are in my opinion very small.

The whole “refutation” by Jackson of the reweave theory is actually one single sentence taken out of the context from the short article that was written by Jackson on the request of Barrie Schwortz. As Barrie writes on his page: David Rolfe’s 2008 BBC documentary features physicist John Jackson, co founder of the 1978 STURP team and founder of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado, and discusses his new hypothesis regarding the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud, based on possible c14 enrichment of linen due to the CO (carbon monoxide) in the atmosphere. According to Jackson, a 2% contamination could skew the resulting date by as much as 1400 years. Rather than attempt to describe Jackson’s theory myself, I asked John to write a short article to describe it in his own words. The article can be found there: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/jackson.pdf We read there: While this hypothesis has been argued on the basis of indirect chemistry, it can be discounted on the basis of evident bandings in the 1978 radiographs and transmitted light images of STURP. These data photographs show clearly that the banding structures (which are in the Shroud) propagate in an uninterrupted fashion through the region that would, ten years later, be where the sample was taken for radiocarbon dating. Aside from some personal considerations (reweave theory was rival for his own carbon monoxide theory, and was proposed by Rogers, with whom Jackson was at odds), not everyone agrees with Jackson assesment of those data. Alan and Mary Whangers claimed in their presentation from 3rd International Dallas Conference on the Shroud of Turin (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/whanger.pdf ): To help clarify this issue, we examined in detail the area of the C14 specimen on the radiographs. An irregular band of threads with increased radiodensity and extending variably about 5/8 inch (1.7 cm) into the Shroud fabric is noted immediately adjacent to much of the length of the seam that borders the frontal MC. In a close up view of the area where the Raes sample and the single C14 sample were taken, irregularities in some of the weave pattern can be noted on the Shroud fabric adjacent to the seam. (Figure 18) There is significant variability in the radiodensity of both warp and weft threads in this area. Some of the threads angulate, and the continuity of a few seems to be broken. This area is denser and the 3:1 herringbone weave pattern is much less obvious than in the nearby body of the Shroud fabric. Our conclusion is that the radiographs are strongly suggestive of significant alterations in the threads and weave of the Shroud fabric in the area from which the C14 specimen was taken, thus casting major doubts on the validity of the radiocarbon dating. Besides as Hugh described, the patch consist probably of the new threads spliced and glued together with the old. This suggest that repair might have passed unnoticed on the STURP radiographs and transmitted light photographs as there would be (appaerent) continuity of the threads. Beside such continuity is observed also between side strip and main body of the Shroud, even despite we know that they were originally separated (see http://www.shroud.com/adler2.htm ). ..","date":"2015-03-08","mins":"7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"id":"comment-192805","author":"o_k","post":"1.

Me, for example. Enough questions and enough doubts have already arisen, and the 1988 radiocarbon dating ought not to pose any challenge to evidence for authenticity. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. Because the main problem is not whether 1988 C 14 dating is faulty, but whether it is possible to skew the results from 1st century to medieval. The issue of 1988 C 14 dating requires answering several questions: 1. Are the 1988 test results reliable? The clear answer is NO, they are not reliable. The statistical considerations (X^2 and other statistical tests, presence of gradient among dates), as well as considerations about the region (various anomalies, compared to the centre of the cloth) clearly show us that the results are unreliable and cannot be trusted. But the next question is: 2. Are the 1988 test results wrong? The answer is PROBABLY, based on the tests itself, and Yes based on other considerations. Remember, even badly performed measurements can give true results. To know if the 1988 date is wrong, we need other, historical, chemical etc. Data that would prove the Shroud must be older. Here we have those data (Robert the Clari account, Hungarian Pray Manuscript, Rogers’s vanillin) showing that the Shroud must be much older. But the next question is: 3. Does the Shroud date to the first century? The answer is WE DON’T KNOW. The problem is that most people consider only two options, either the Shroud dates to circa 30 AD, or it dates to circa 1350 AD. But this is oversimplification. Even with the wrong results of the 1988 tests, the Shroud could still be a fake from another era, from the 4th, 6th, 8th century. So the next question is 4. Could the Shroud date to the first century? The answer is also WE DON’T KNOW. To determine that, we should determine whether it is possible to skew the dates from the 1st century to 13th century. For today, given the 66 75 % treshold of the new material introduced, if the 1st century date have to be maintained, and given all the facts we know, the only realistic option for this to be true seems the reweave theory..","date":"2015-03-09","mins":"4:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"id":"comment-192975","author":"o_k","post":"Dave: The tragedy would be if we were certain that 1988 dating was wrong, yet there was no physical possibility to be as much as 1300 years wrong (being “just” a few centuries wrong still satisfies preconvinced sceptics)..","date":"2015-03-09","mins":"2:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"id":"comment-192961","author":"o_k","post":"For what I know, Whangers are usually ignored, because of their sometimes bizarre “I think I see” claims.

It accounts for the C14 error, the history of the shroud makes it likely, and the discovery of cotton seems to suggests its possibility, but the close up photos of two of the sample pieces, together with a close up photo of the area immediately adjacent, show that it just isn’t there. From: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf “A blinded analysis of a photograph of the Zurich C 14 sample, by Thomas Ferguson & Co. Ltd, world renowned makers of Double Damask Linen, resulted in their perception that the sample was “touched up to prevent unraveling.” They further observed, “We have to say that we see the twill pattern clearly on both sides, but still there is something different left versus right.” (Ferguson & Co., 2000) In a second blinded examination of photographs of both the Zurich and uncut C 14 samples, European trained weaver David Pearson, owner of the French Tailors in Columbus, Ohio, immediately recognized the disparate weave pattern and differences in thread size, stating “there is no question that there is different material on each side…(B)It is definitely a patch.(/B)”[(referring to what we have highlighted in Figure 2 as the pink section)] (French Tailors, 2000). He stated that medieval European weavers would typically try to match the original cloth and then hand stitch approximately ½ inch of new material into the old, such that it was invisible to (B)all but the trained eye(/B). This would ensure the long term integrity of the material, while maintaining aesthetic consistency throughout the fabric. This type of detail to repairs would be consistent with the wealth and devotion of the Savoy family, who owned the Shroud at the time. In a third blinded analysis of the Zurich C 14 sample, by Albany International, Louise Harner remarked that “the float is different on either side of the sample” (Albany International Research Company, 2000). It forms a thick/thin, thick/thin pattern on the right side, whereas the left is much more consistent throughout (see Figure 6). This is probably due to the fact that each side of the pattern was woven independently, possibly corroborating Pearson’s belief that part of the sample was a patch.” All boldings mine..","date":"2013-10-18","mins":"2:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-47920","author":"o_k","post":"But the book claims that technique described in it is really invisible, and can explain all what we know about 1988 C 14 datingor needs some modifications to adjust it to the now known facts?.","date":"2013-10-18","mins":"3:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-47909","author":"o_k","post":"So I found that (B) and (/B) (I) doesn’t work (/I), maybe (b) and (/b) ?.","date":"2013-10-18","mins":"2:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-47906","author":"o_k","post":"Charles Freeman : Perhaps someone can quote from Rogers’ article the part where he shows that the threads themselves are different from the rest of the Shroud and the evidence he provides for this. I have found it difficult to find. He just seems to assume it rather than provide evidence of his own. Has anyone found enough cotton threads to make a difference to the date? The gum that he notes could have been added at any time to an original cloth as, apparently, this was a standard way of protecting cloth that might otherwise have decayed again can someone quote the evidence that he provides to prove that the gum was a dye and not simply a means of strengthening an old cloth. “A gum/dye/mordant coating is easy to observe on Raes and radiocarbon yarns. No other part of the shroud shows such a coating. The early thermal evolution of furfural during pyrolysis/ms analyses, the relatively easy water solubility, the yellow color formed with iodine, and the easy hydrolysis suggest gum Arabic. Gum Arabic is obtained from Acacia senegal and is composed of pentose sugar units. Its presence as a major component in the coatings on the Raes and radiocarbon samples is not a surprise, because it has long been a common vehicle in tempera paints. The radiocarbon sample had been dyed. Dyeing was probably done intentionally on pristine replacement material to match the color of the older, sepia colored cloth. The gum is probably the same age as the Raes and radiocarbon yarn and should have no effect on the age determination. In any case, this water soluble, easily hydrolyzed gum would have been removed completely by the cleaning procedures used on the dated samples[1]. The dye found on the radiocarbon sample was not used in Europe before about a.d.1291 and was not common until more than 100 years later [6]. The combined evi dence from chemical kinetics, analytical chemistry, cotton content, and pyrolysis/ms proves that the material from the radiocarbon area of the shroud is significantly different from that of the main cloth. The radiocarbon sample was thus not part of the original cloth and is invalid for determining the age of the shroud. Because the storage conditions through the centuries are unknown, a more accurate age determination will require new radiocarbon analyses with several fully characterized and carefully prepared samples.”.","date":"2013-10-18","mins":"1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-47927","author":"o_k","post":"“A gum/dye/mordant coating is easy to observe on Raes and radiocarbon yarns.

It’s not at all clear what they were given to comment on. Was it that very unsharp photo of the Zurich sample that accompanies the paper? If so, the few irregularities noticed by the ‘experts’ are nothing like enough to establish a patch. Do you really think that they showed to the experts this compressed to minimize its size photo that is included in pdf version of their paper? Even the writings on the other figures in this document are not clear enough to be easily readable. But I suppose the original illustrations actually were. If the patch was anything like that illustrated, then at least two of the Arizona dates, and at least two of the Zurich dates, would have been pure, unadulterated patch, while the others would have almost pure shroud. This is not in accordance with the actual dates found. From: http://www.shroud.com/vanhels3.htm “I asked the British Museum for some explications. Dr. Morven Leese explained the LOW Arizona errors as follows : Arizona did not send in FOUR, but EIGHT “paired” dates, each pair measured the same day, with the same set of standards and blanks. The EIGHT “dependent” dates were combined in FOUR “independent dates, given in Table 1 (Nature). Each pair of DEPENDENT dates are combined into an INDEPENDENT date.” What guarantee do we have that other raw data were not manipulated to give the “proper results”? None. And in fact , laboratories and British Museum have all the cards in their hands, they can give us conflicting accounts how the measures were performed, and samples cut, adjusting them to any proposed patch theory.

In this sample, Raes found that the side seam had been attached to the adjacent main Shroud by a 2 ply linen sewing thread (18).By removing the sewing thread, Raes was able to separate his sample into two distinct pieces, which he identified as “Piece 1” and “Piece 2.” Each piece exhibits different characteristics, such as cotton content, lignin content at the growth nodes, and thread size, suggesting two different origins of the yarns.”.","date":"2013-10-19","mins":"10:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-48038","author":"o_k","post":"Hugh Farey : Arizona seems to have set aside the thinnest piece of the two samples it received, and cut the other one in half.

Rogers tries to cover a lot of ground but only provides ten references for the whole of his paper. It just left me with questions that are unresolved. From: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part3.pdf Except perhaps the amount of cotton, all that I found is consistent with Raes’ claims: Gossypium herbaceum inside the linen thread. However, given the amount of cotton I found, there is another possible hypothesis: the mixture could have been the result of a willful act. The spinner could have spun together flax fibers with some cotton fibers as it was sometimes carried on in the Middle Ages (and this is still the case today).

Enough with mystery. Let’s face the facts. The image in the psalter is intriguing, but is it evidence or just a clue? A sceptic, like Hugh or Collin, would go this way: * pre forensic insight/premonition/knowledge: flogging was practiced in every epoch, and maybe an illustrator just saw someone being flogged and showed effects of this on the image. Besides it is hard to say something about “accuracy” presented on the image, just a few horizontal marks painted to represent scourges. * position of the flogged Christs, there are thousands of illustrated manuscripts so it is possible that on one example the location of the arms and feet, the representation of the naked Christ etc. Would be the same as on the Shroud.

If only 78% of this sample’s original C14 remains, the sample is about 2050 years old. If 80% of this sample’s original C14 remains (a 2% difference), the sample is about 1850 years old. So that can’t be it. If 0.44mg of modern carbon was simply added to the shroud (2% more than the original amount), then 98% of the shroud’s carbon would be old, and 2% would be modern. This is insufficient to change the apparent date of the shroud by more than a few years. So that can’t be it either. Anyone got any better ideas? Hugh I’ll try to explain it to you. The Shroud was dated to 1260 1390, that is 691 years BP. The carbon dated to 691 years BP has 92 % of the carbon “in the present moment” (that is year 1950). The year 25 AD is equivalent of 1983 BP.

It/they would perfectly fit with a 66% contaminant amount.” Hugh F at #31: “If 34% of the shroud is 1st century, and 66% is 17th century, then the overall percentage of C14 compared to the present day percentage is 90.6662%. … I’m sorry, Max, but we’ll need a lot more contamination than that to make a 1st century cloth appear 14th century.” Wiki extract on Princess Clotilde of Savoy: “Maria Clotilde of Savoy (Ludovica Teresa Maria Clotilde; 2 March 1843 – 25 June 1911) was born in Turin to Vittorio Emanuele II, later King of Italy and his first wife Adelaide of Austria. She was the wife of Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte.” I assume this is the Princess Clotilde referred to by Max; It fits the 1868 date when she would have been aged ~25. Conclude that if it were Princess Clotilde, repair would have been done in 19th century, not 17th century. Dave: See my posts #39,#40, #41, #46 to avoid confusion. Duches Clothilde performed repairs in 1868, however the equivalent radiocarbon date is almost the same as equivalent radiocarbon date of 1694, when Blessed Sebastian Valfrè was performing his repairs on the Shroud.

Then I argued that the scourge marks on the Shroud are not distributed randomly, but follow specific pattern, contrary to the contemporary drawings.

The only portions of the Shroud that looks missing,are the ends of the side strip around the edges (not including wholes in the patched areas, plus Raes and C 14 sample). No image areas were taken from the Shroud. Some older publications assumed that the Shroud’s lenght were shortened from 5 meters to approximately 4.4 by cutting material for relics, but there are strong counterarguments against that. Another fact confirmed by His Majesty was that it was traditionally affirmed, that at one point in the past, the edges of the Lenzuoli (Sheet) had become so tattered as to cause embarrassment or criticism of the Custodians, and those areas were repaired and rewoven using identical techniques, but obviously with similar, yet newer, materials containing dyes and other medieval manufacturing ingredients, in an attempt to better blend the new sections in, as best possible, with the original fabric.

Because on the quad mosaic photos presented in Benford/Marino paper, both outer corners around the missing parts of the side strip have similar greenish color, indicating differences in chemical composition (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/benfordmarino2008.pdf see Figure 5) The problem is its interpretation are those rewoven, or simply dirty areas?

If the shroud had been stored at a constant 25°C, it would have taken about 1319 years to lose a conservative 95% of its vanillin. At 23°C, it would have taken about 1845 years. At 20 ◦C, it would take about 3095 years.” These figures were derived by direct extrapolation of his version of the Arrhenius equation as it applies to vanillin. By an exactly similar extrapolation, we find that if the temperature was 140°C it would have taken 2 minutes. This means that if the Shroud were ever in a box which became heated to extent that silver melted, there would be no vanillin present, regardless of how recently it had been made. If the shroud had been produced between a.d. 1260 and 1390, as indicated by the radiocarbon analyses, lignin should be easy to detect. A linen produced in a.d. 1260 would have retained about 37% of its vanillin in 1978. The Raes threads, the Holland cloth, and all other medieval linens gave the test for vanillin wherever lignin could be observed on growth nodes. The disappearance of all traces of vanillin from the lignin in the shroud indicates a much older age than the ra diocarbon laboratories reported. The fire of 1532 could not have greatly affected the vanillin content of lignin in all parts of the shroud equally. The thermal conductivity of linen is very low, 2.1 × 10 −4 cal cm −1 s −1 ◦ C −1 ; therefore, the unscorched parts of the folded cloth could not have become very hot. The temperature gradient through the cloth in the reliquary should have been very steep, and the cloth’s center would not have heated at all in the time available. The rapid change in color from black to white at the margins of the scorches illustrates this fact. Any heating at the time of the fire would decrease the amount of vanillin in the lignin as a function of the tempera ture and time heated; however, different amounts of vanillin would have been lost in different areas. No samples from any location on the shroud gave the vanillin test. Rogers, “Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the shroud of turin” p. 191.

That’s all the weft and nearly half the warp threads, or maybe 7/10 of both. Not neccesarily. “The diameter of the Shroud warp and weft threads is slightly different” (from Siefker & Spicer paper). And so are their volumes. And so perhaps weights of XVI century vs I century are slightly different. Remember that the average weight of the Shroud is 20 25 mg/cm^2, while weights of the samples were 36 43 mg/cm^2. EXPLANATION, PLEASE. Hugh Farey : So, 1) Try examining Barrie Schwortz’s photos at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/arizona.pdf. The piece photographed contains about 45 threads. If the interweave theory is correct, around 30 are new and 15 old. Can you identify which are which? Can invisible weaving really be that invisible? How can you VISUALLY distinguish between 16th century, and 1st century thread? If they are mixed together, I see no way. That’s why they call it INVISIBLE. For my untrained eye, weft threads on Arizona sample seem darker, however that’s just my own impression, and don’t be suggested. Hugh Farey : 2) The next photo that needs examining closely is the x ray of the foot of the cloth in http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf. (Figure 7). It is poorly reproduced here, but very clearly in Schwalbe & Rogers, Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin. There is continuous warp and weft banding right through the C 14 area, and no evidence of interpolated threads, although Benford and Marino, using a very poor copy in their paper, think they see one ‘break’ in one ‘intensity’ line. I don’t argue, because I consider the patch going probably much deeper into cloth, than Benford and Marino thought. Hugh Farey : 3) Next, the actual dates of the Damon Nature paper have never been queried by statisticians, let alone massacred. The best analysis of the data is by Riani, Atkkinson et al, who do demonstrate, using the data which they do not query, that there is indeed a clear chronological progression along the sample area. This accounts very well for the anomalous chi squared value and its 5% significance, and does indeed suggest contamination, but it does nothing to suggest that any part of the sample area is from the 1st century. Don’t manipulate my words. I haven’t said that statisticians showed that the cloth is from 1st century. I know what is the purpose of statistical tests. They simply show that 1260 1390 interval is UNRELIABLE, and the true age of the Shroud IS STILL UNKNOWN. The Shroud is probably older than 13 14th century (because of unknown younger contamination), but statistical tests DOESN’T SAY HOW MUCH! It could be from the 1st century, it could be from the 11th century. WE DON’T KNOW. We know (or better use the word ‘suppose’, as there are no certainities in statistics), however, that we cannot trust Damon et. Al results. Note: if the reweave had been PERFECT, that is 7/10 ratio would be the same through the WHOLE SAMPLE (that means the threads would be spliced everywhere), the statistical tests would have shown NOTHING they would argue that the data is consistent. Just like the data for Oxford and Zurich were self consistent, it was Arizona which showed that something is strange with the sample, see Remi van Haelst paper:http://www.shroud.com/vanhels3.htm So the hypothethical reweave was not so perfect, and anomaly was detected in statistical analysis. Hugh Farey : 4) Finally, however invisible mending is carried out, it results in the new threads running alongside the old threads for some distance as they merge. Sadly I don’t have the much touted Shroud App, as I don’t have an i Pad, but if the HD image is as clear as they say, it will surely be possible to examine the area around the C 14 excision and post a screen grab showing these parallel weavings. If the interweaving hypothesis is true there must be hundreds of them. Once again: How do you VISUALLY distinguish between 16th century, and 1st century thread?

Emanuella Amrinelli in her “La Sindone – Un’immagine Impossibile” (Edizioni San Paolo – Cinisello, Balsamo (MI), 1996) is more precise 2.450 kg. The Shroud is 437×111 cm. Thus the average weight WITH ALL ADDITIONS is 50.5 mg/cm^2. The sample of 7×1 cm, of the Shroud itself, weighted 300 mg, that is 42.85 mg/cm^2. The larger cut part of 8.6×1.6 cm weighted 478.1 mg (36.89 mg/cm^2). The average weight of the Shroud itself is based on textile analysis. Maria Grazia Siliato in “Sindone Mistero Dell’Impronta di duemila anni fa” (Edizioni Piemme Spa., (AL) 1997) quotes 4 analyses: A. Timossi: 23 mg/cm^2 G. Raes 25 mg/cm^2 R. A. Morris 25 mg/cm^2 G.

I was arbitrarily assuming that there was some!” Hugh, don’t be naive. Had it been so, the whole C 14 dating would have been unnecessary ; ) Hugh: “Apart from that, new thread might be visibly thicker/thinner, looser/denser or even rougher/smoother. A demonstration that 15 of the Schwortz sample threads look different from the rest would be convincing, but I don’t find that.” Hugh, in every population of 45 threads, no matter of age, there would be 15 or so that are “visibly thicker/thinner, looser/denser or even rougher/smoother.” From Siefker & Spicer paper (L2.0): “Due to the fact that the threads and the cloth are handmade, both the number of fibers per thread and their diameter vary up to 50%” Hugh: “The banding seems clear right the way across the photos. Are you suggesting a patch over, say, 20cm wide and high? Only that would account for the uninterrupted stripes that are clearly observable.” Maybe. Maybe the patch goes much deeper than everyone thought, with new vs old threads ratio gradually changing. BTW: the bandings go interrupted from the main cloth to he side strip, but WE KNOW that the side strip was carefully re attached to the main cloth. So perhaps it is possible. Hugh: “However, to suggest that that means that no information at all can be derived from the radiocarbon results is absurd. Assuming that the raw data is acceptable, and at no point do our statisticians dispute that, a collection of 12 independent dates between 1200 and 1400 cannot be rejected with a simple, “It could be from the 1st century, it could be from the 11th century.” Statistically, that’s an imprecision vastly more unlikely than the precision quoted by the Nature paper.” Hugh: If 12 pairs of 1st and 17th century threads blended together were carbon dated, each of the 12 datings would reveal the date of around 1000 AD. The average of 12 measurements would also be around 1000 AD, and statistical tests would show that the results ARE PERFECTLY CONSISTENT. The average spin of the electron is 0, but the only possibilities are either +1/2 or 1/2. I assume that you know a little bit about the basics of statistics. Statistical analysis show that the ASSUMPTION of normal (gaussian) distribution centered around 691 years BP, SHOULD BE REJECTED. Thus, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. The carbon dated material consist of a mix of older and younger material. IT IS UNKNOWN WHAT IS THE RATIO AND AGES OF OLDER AND YOUNGER. Manipulating those parameteres, the Shroud may be from 11 century AD, or 11 century BC. Hugh: “In this case, you don’t have to distinguish between threads of different ages; you simply have to show a bit of anomalous weaving, where two threads run alongside each other for a few millimetres, as the new thread is woven into the pattern.

The only hypothesis that makes sense to me is that this particular corner was once torn apart (which is quite plausible, because it was the place where Shroud was usually held during various exhibitions etc.), and had to be carefully reconstructed, thread by thread using linen, perhaps with some minor cotton contaminants. There are various opinions whether it is possible, but if it is, there would be no visual difference to original cloth. Warps original, wefts new. All carefuly attached to original cloth. There are several stitches in that area, one made by Princess Clothilde (Wilson, Blood & Shroud, figure 20). Anyway, we know now that the sidestrip is identical like the rest of the cloth, and was carefully aattached to main body. So it is perhaps posibble. Now some calculations using data from here: http://depts.washington.edu/qil/datasets/uwten98 14c.txt Year Year BP 1865 117 1695 115 1535 301 25 1983 Lets assume 70 % of new material vs 30 % of old.

Hugh Farey : I think the word ‘unconditionally’ is important here. ‘True scientists’ don’t accept anything ‘unconditionally.’ However, I can understand very well their accepting the date as established. 1) In their “Evidence for the skewing of the C14 Dating” paper (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf), Benford and Marino present a diagram of where they think a patch was attached. However, this would only produce the required dates if the 12 sub samples actually tested were cut in ribbons from top to bottom of the original same strip. If the samples were cut ‘horizontally,’ then one would expect some dates to be entirely 16th century, some to be entirely 1st century, and only, possibly, a middle one to be a mixture of the two. As we know, a substantial portion of the Tucson sample was not dated at all, but retained. The dated fractions would therefore be almost entirely 16th or 1st, with no intermediates. We also know that the Zurich sample was first cut horizontally into two pieces, and then these two further divided. The dates obtained by the Zurich labs do not match a “patch” scenario. .

What happened to the rest of the mustache/beard on the veil relative to the Shroud? Who knows? ; ) Generally one should stress out, that although the faces on both Shroud and Manoppello are supposed to be the same, and represent the same person, they are not identical in every detail. Contrary to popularised phrase, Manoppello is not a positive of the negative image on the Shroud, not in technical sense. There are some differences, notably the open/closed eyes, the more prominent beard and mustache on the Shroud image (although this still may be illusion, as the imaging mechanism on the Shroud depends on body cloth distance, also modulated in masterful way by several lighter and darked bands across the cloth so the initial visual impression may be misleading, and one should not trust it too much), as well as slightly different position of lips and opened mouth. Yet this does not undermine the conclusion The hypothesis (whether realistic or not) is that those are two images taken at disitnct time moments, just before (the Shroud) and just after the Resurrection (Manoppello). The key is to determine whether those faces actually are meant to represent the same person, and it seems yes. 3. For me, the main things with overlays is what about control images, i.e. Doing the same analysis on 3 unrelated bearded men there has to be a certain amount of overlap between all of them how much, I think, can be relatively subjective. The cloning enthusiasts show a pretty reasonable morphing/overlay of Prince William & the Shroud, including bearded & clean shaven PW versions. The cloning enthusiast rarely (in fact never) work so methodically as I do. Their morphing presentations may be visually stunning, but they are most likely erronous – which can be shown, if studied carefully, point by point. As far as I remember, I cannot recall any morphing experiment that used marked features of the face (like I presented above) to show whether the positions of common details on both images actually correspond with each other, whether the proportions are actually the same etc. And absolutely no callibration. When you look at one face at one moment, and on another next moment, you may be visually deceived, and suppose they are the same, even if they are entirely different. And in another way, even if the two faces are actually the same, if overlay is performed badly, you can be under impression that they are different. So the need for as much clarity as possible and objective criteria is evident. Here you have my callibration images. I based my measuremnts on both Shroud Scope and Sister Blandina atlas, which contains live size images with callibration distances. Even then, the actual size of both these images remained uncertain and there is still a possibility of a few % margin of error. Generally, the most important criterion, is not the perfect overlay of images (which may give false positive results sometimes), but the correspondence of wound marks. In my previosu presnetation I have shown a dozen or so congruence points, showing that those two faces are actually related to each other beyond coincidence: With the knew, better and more detailed overlay their number will likely grow. Do the front & back images of the veil superimpose/overlay precisely or is there some drift? As I have only obverse side of the Manoppelo, I can’t directly answer that. Yet as the differences between obverse and reverse sides of Manoppello concern only minor details (and even that cannot be taken as proven, as much depends on light conditions when pictures were taken it has been observed that different conditions led to different details perceived, more details in Treppa Aszyk book), I suppose that yes..","date":"2015-03-12","mins":"7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"id":"comment-193301","author":"o_k","post":"0. The controls: One should be careful with controls and interpret them carefully. Of course it is entirely possible to find a face with similar proportions, but one should think about what it means. For example Roberto Falcinelli wrote a paper sceptical about Manoppello, arguing that it was painted by Durer, due to some ambiguos phrases in some old art history books and visual similarity with his famous Christ like self portrait. I responded to him and compared his self portait with Manoppello (see https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/02/manoppello shroud and durer a short presentation by o k/ ). The match is perfect, but it does not mean that Manoppello was painted by Durer (which is as likely as the theory that Leonardo faked the Shroud) rather the other way around, that Durer was influenced by Manoppello. On the contrary, the similarity of wounds is very significant showing that both images (Shroud and the Veil) are intended to represent the same person. The question is: why? 1. The banding issues on both the Shroud and the Veil are entirely different things, as image mechanisms on both cloths seems to be entirely different. The Shroud is monochromatic image, in which the intensity of coloration depends on body cloth distance (the 3 D effect). There is also some influence of lighter/darker bands which modulate the intensity. On the contrary, the Veil is polychromatic, and does not include the 3 D effect similar to that of the Shroud. There are other issues like the transparency and the alleged presence of multiple images encoded in it, which are visible under different lighting conditions. There are of course bandings on Manoppello, yet their relation with the images have not been explored yet, as far as i know: 2. See above. The issues regarding the Veil are entirely differnt then that of the Shroud. On the Veil we don’t have the real bloodstains (probably) but rather images of bloodstains. 3. Unfortunately not yet.

I know this argumentation from Maria Grazia Siliato’s book, Całun Turyński: Tajemnica Odbicia Postaci sprzed 2000 lat (original title ‘Sindone Mistero Dell’Impronta Di Duemila Anni Fa’), Wydawnictwo M , Kraków 1999 pg. 36 38. Yet the problem is much more complex, as we don’t know precise weights and sizes of the radiocarbon samples. Silliato adopts that the entire sample cut by Riggi was 8.1cm x1.6 cm, weighting 478.1 mg (thus surface area of 12.96 cm^2 and average density of ~37 mg/cm^2). Then that it was trimmed to rectangle 7cm x1cm , wieght 300 mg (7 cm^2 surface area, 42.85 mg average density). Yet those numbers are not precise, and different values are also quotred. This has great impact on average density. For example G. Fanti, F. Crosilla, M. Riani, A.C. Atkinson, A robust statistical analysis of the 1988 Turin Shroud radiocarbon analysis, Proceedings of the International Workshop on the Scientific Approach to the Acheiropoietos Images, ENEA Frascati, Italy 4 6 May 2010 http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Riani Web.pdf quoting Walsh suggest different size of the sample that is 8.1 cm x2.1 cm =17.01 cm^ 2 for the whole 478.1 mg sample (thus giving density of ~28 mg/cm^2 ), and 8.1×1.6 for reduced 300 mg sample which corresponds to the 23.14 mg/cm^2 density. But on the other hands the trimmed part circa 8.1 cm x0.5 cm (which is also more trianglethan rectangle like) would have ~ 44 mg/cm^2 density, if calculated as rectangle, and the absurd 88 mg/cm^2 if calculated as triangle. The fragment retained in Arizona (Rachel Freer Waters, Timothy Jull , Investigating A Dated Piece Of The Shroud Of Turin, RADIOCARBON, Vol 52, Nr 4, 2010, p 1521–1527 http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http%3 A%2 F%2 Fradiocarbon.library.arizona.edu%2 F Volume52%2 F Number4%2 F33737617 d6e4 4797 ba23 fb8e0f303abe ,see also Report on the STERA, Inc. University of Arizona Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory Macro Photography 30 August 2012 http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/arizona.pdf ) has a size of approx. 0.5 cm x 1cm and the weight of 12.39 mg, thus the density is 24.78 mg. Basing on Shroud Scope I suppose that the size of the whole radiocarbon sample was closer to 8.1 cm x2.1 cm than 8.1 cm x1.6 cm. I think the average density of what was dated can estimated as ~ 30 mg/cm^2 that is maybe a little bit heavier than average for the whole cloth, but not much. I once thought that those density calculations had great significance for re evaluation of 1988 carbon dating, but now I don’t think so that their importance is only marginal. There are other, much stronger arguments that 1988 dating was flawed. And one final note the 41.65% of new material is not enough. To skew the carbon dating from 1st to 13th 14th century one needs that 65 75 % of the sample to be interpolated material (depending on date of interpolation).

What concerns me more, is the carbon dating of the Tunic of Argenteuil and the Sudarium of Oviedo, particularly the later. All those objects are considered to be related to each other, as there is evidence they were worn by one and the same person. Just to remind everyone: The (wool) Tunic of Argenteuil has been carbon dated twice: * first dating, by Saclay: 1480 +/ 30 years BP, that is 530 650 AD at 95 % * second dating, by Archeolabs 1260 +/ 40 years BP, that is 670 880 AD at 95 % The Sudarium of Oviedo has also several times. Various accounts exist: Dating in the 80s, by two laboratories: Tuscon and Toronto: * 653 786 AD Toronto , and 642 769 AD (in other version 642 869 AD) Tuscon. Micheal Hesemann, on the other hand, reprots 540 869 AD * Mark Guscin reports (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n65part6.pdf): Just weeks before the congress took place, new samples from the Sudarium were subject to carbon dating. Five samples were dated from five different cloths –three of them came up with the expected date, while the cloth from an Egyptian mummy returned a date of any time in the 19th or 20th centuries. The laboratory immediately concluded that the cloth (and the mummy) were fakes. The sample from the Sudarium was dated to around 700 AD. Scientist César Barta spoke about the carbon dating process, emphasising the fact that if carbon dating is always absolutely accurate, then we could just as well finish the congress there and then. However, there were several points to bear in mind– in specialist carbon dating magazines, about half the samples dated come up with the expected date, around 30% with an “acceptable” date, and the other 20% is not what one would expect from archaeology. The laboratory used (via the National Museum in Madrid) said they were surprised by the result and asked if the cloth was contaminated with any oil based product, as oil is not cleaned by the laboratory processes used before carbon dating and if oil is present on a sample, the date produced by carbon dating is in fact the date of contamination. Finally, the history of the Sudarium is very well established and there are definite references to its presence in Jerusalem in AD 570 and at the beginning of the fifth century. Micheal Hesemann in a recent book (“Chusta Chrystusa, Naukowcy na tropie zmartwychwstania” pg. 230 232, that is polish edition of “Das Bluttuch Christi”) gives some more details. The dating was performed by Beta Analytic Inc. From Miami, and the result was 660 890 AD, similar to the Archeolabs dating of the Tunic of Argenteuil. What is the source of contamination, assuming all those relics date from the time of Christ? In case of the Shroud it is most probably the invisible reweave that’s the only non conspirational and non sci fi thesis hat makes sense. But what about Tunic and Sudarium. We should remember that the Tunic was buried in Parish garden by Abbot Ozet during French revolution, and is heavily contaminated by both organic and non organic contaminant. Marion and Lucotte suggested it was contaminated by calcium carbonate and performed some tests which showed that it is not entirely removed by cleaning procedure, but I don’t believe it was the sole factor in the case of Tunic. Than one should ask question what about Sudarium? Most probably it is wax it was found all over the surface of the Sudarium. But is that amount enought? Some calculations: I assumed the true age of the relics to be 1983 BP, roughly the time of Christ. The date of contamination to be 200 BP, roughly 17th 19th century (see http://depts.washington.edu/qil/datasets/uwten98 14c.txt ). Thus the amount of contamination to skew the carbon dating is : * for Miami dating of Sudarium, and Archeolabs dating of Tunic, 1260 BP (670 880 AD)=38 % * for Saclay dating of the Tunic, 1480 BP (530 650 AD) =26 % Now assume that the source of contamination is wax, roughly 80 % of which is carbon. Thus the amount of contamination: *for Miami dating of Sudarium, assuming 44 % of linen consisting of carbon =25 %, assuming assuming 25 % of linen consisting of carbon =16 % * for Archeolabs dating of Tunic, assuming 50 % of linen consisting of carbon =28 % * for Saclay dating of the Tunic, assuming 50 % of linen consisting of carbon =18 % Possible?

Theoretically it is possible for the Shroud to be from the 1st century, while dating randomly gives the range of 13th 14th century but the purely random chances for this are negligible (“one in trillions or so”). However, if there is a patch, the assumption of randomness must be thrown out. It is calculated that for 1st century Shroud and 16th century patch approximately 75 % of the material must be a patch, to give circa 13 14th century result. But what the chances are that the proportion is 75 % (and not 20 % or 90 %), we cannot say it is beyond the domain of statistics. We cannot give a number.

According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeswax , An approximate chemical formula for beeswax is C15 H31 COOC30 H61, thus ~ 80 % of it is carbon. Thus for Oxley’s 24 % , and 75 % new vs old ratio (assuming circa 16th century contamination) needed to switch the date of the TS from 1st to 14th century, the amount of wax contamination must be approximately 47 % (let’s say 50 % for 66 % new vs old, assuming later 17th 19th century contamination, it needs to be 37 %). Possible? Hardly, I think, but one must finally detemine the sizes and masses of the samples their average density should be 2x average density of the TS..","date":"2014-04-20","mins":"4:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/ray-schneider-why-is-the-carbon-dating-wrong-i-dont-know-that-it-is-wrong-i-am-quite-certain/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Ray Schneider: Why is the carbon dating wrong?

Such coincidence, although strange, is entirely possible if we assume reweave hypothesis but extremely unlikely for other hypothesis like oil wax contamination, neutron radiation, carbon monoxide enrichment or so. For several reasons, that I do not discuss here. However one should note that actual results are not so perfectly centered at 1325 +/ 65. The results in Nature are (Table 3 http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm) AD 1273 – 1288 at 68 % confidence (that is 1 sigma) and AD 1262 – 1312, 1353 – 1384 at 95 % (2 sigma) confidence. So coincidence with first presentation of the Shroud at Lirey in 1356 is rather accidental than related, IMHO. Important note: confidence and significance are two different terms! Or, are we thinking that there is no way to 1) know the odds, which is one thing, or there is no way to 2) know if Stephen is right, which is something altogether different.

The Besancon Shroud) in the Shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary, theotokos in the Orthodox tradition, in the Blachernae district of Constantinople. There is absolutely no reason to link it with any relic in the imperial collection. Charles, it is futile only for the convinced sceptics. There is one very valid reason why the shroud might have left his well guarded home at Bucoleon: the newly installed by the crusaders young emperor Alexios IV. Here is the translation of the key paragraph from my article: And then the shroud with image of Christ appears in Blachernae. In the same temple, where Byzantines in the year 860 were praying before the veil of Virgin Mary for the repulse of the Rus. Now, every Friday there is raised (Robert de Clari literally writes that it “raises”) a shroud with a visible figure of Christ – that is, someone greater than even the Mother of God. Had this show been performed there for a long time? Nothing indicates that, although it is known that during the Kommen period emperors started to prefer Blachernae Palace instead of the Great Palace, or the Bucoleon Palace. But in 1203 Constantinople, everything was possible. For example, that Alexios exhibited previosuly carefully hidden from the eyes of the common people burial linens; to calm down the people and convince them about divine support for his rule.

De Clari does not report any crowds there and it was in the hippodrome that the emperors rallied support. Probably the cloth had probably been exhibited on a regular basis for centuries just as the icon of he Virgin in the same church had been. Rather nothing would convince a sceptic. For Zdzisław Pentek, the polish translator of de Clari’s chronicle, there has been no doubt that the shroud refferred by de Clari was actually the Shroud of Turin. To exhibit a holy relic on hippodrome instead of church? If you read Holger Klein ( and you must if you want to speculate about the relics in Constantinople) you will see that there’d were other relics that were paraded by emperors in the streets at times of crisis, e.g. Fragments of the True Cross and favoured icons that were always placed higher in the hierarchy of relics than any of the burial linens. Yes but this does not apply to the Shroud moreover with the image of Christ. The common people are unworthy of seeing the splendor of the God man himself. That’s how they thought. Methinks it is you who are fitting the story to your agenda! I have performed many fittings in my life, and I know that some of them are good some are not. But this is basic tool we fit the story to the data, both you and me. The problem is whose fit is better.

But the evidence for the presence of the Shroud in Constantinople is quite strong especially when one combine iconographic arguments with historical documents.

What we need is evidence. There is no evidence of any transfer. There is no evidence for most of the events that took place, as they were simply not recorded by historians. And that’s not a problem. Do you know how far out of town the. Blachernae chapel is? About 6 7 km from Bucoleon palace circa 1 h walk. Many people on the countryside, even today have longer way to go to church on Sunday. How ever would an emperor expect to rally support there? Th e emperor would appear in the hippodrome next to the imperial palace to rally support in the largest arena in he city. The relics would be paraded in the streets around the hippodrome. Byzantines liked much subtler way. The barbarian crusaders are walking on the streets of the City of Constantine. But no worry, the Christ Himself raises on His Shroud in popular Blachernae church so everything will be fine. God favors the new emperor. That’s the message to deliver. This still does not mean, of course, that the Blachernae Shroud was originally in the imperial palace as, although there is no evidence for this, it could have been bought to the Blachernae Church much earlier and directly from Jerusalem as the robe of the Virgin Mary was. “Although there is no evidence for this…” Charles can’t you see that you use double standards? One another important note. Several authors report that Nikephoros Kallistos (14th century ) reported that Empress Pulcheria placed burial linens of Christ in Blachernae church, when it was built. Quite possible. We know that circa 1380 a fragment of burial linens was sent from Constantinople to the bishop of Suzdal, and later Metropolitan of Moscow Dionysius I long after the Shroud of Turin was displayed in Lirey. But we do know also that there were THREE different relics of Jesus burial cloths in Constantinople, including one with the image.

It is true that this has been seriously questioned, but it not true that it has been discredited. On the whole, I find insufficient reason to doubt that the sample was indeed representative. As you will see, it has been discredited even in the Nature report itself! http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm 3) The chi squared test is a measure of similarity, it not something you pass or fail. If there is a 95% or greater chance that two results are of the same provenance, the hypothesis that they are is, by convention, considered established. If the chance is is less than 95%, then the hypothesis is not considered formally established. This is not the same as saying that it has been disproved. The figure for the Shroud is 94%. Not true! The Chi square for Shroud, as stated in Nature, is 6.4 for 2 degrees of freedom. The critical value for 5 % significance (we can than state that for a random there is only 5 % chance for obtaining higher values than critical) is 5.99, that is LOWER than 6.4 The significance for 6.4 value, 2 d.f. Is only about 4 %. The results stated in Nature fail this (and as Remi van Haelst has shown several others) significance test, which means that there is a systematical error the results are BIASED and cannot be considered credible. See http://calculus calculator.com/statistics/chi squared distribution calculator.html 4) Riani and Atkinson’s chronological gradient is significant, and indicates some discrepancy along the length of the radiocarbon sample strip. It does not discredit a medieval date at all, nor demand any interweaving, although some contamination may be possible. As it is significant, we can throw out 1260 1390 AD date! And as we have no further reliable data, in theory any othere date + later contamination/interpolated material is possible, both medieval and 1st century. And we can say there is no external contamination (I mean oil, dirt, sweat etc.) that may account for a chronological gradient (assuming those contaminants are not uniformly distributed). In the ‘Supplemetary information’ recently released from Oxford (http://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/embed.php?File=preprints.php ) we can read ‘Yields are very good and higher than is usually found by for similar processed by the manual method’ i.e. Meaning that the samples were very little contaminated!. Neither Rogers was able to observe any significant contamination, which he should have spotted , had it been there! The only reliable explanation for the chronological gradient is the reweave hypothesis the presence of interpolated material in different ratio along the sample. 5) Rogers’s discovery of various contaminents may contribute to an understanding of the chronological gradient described above, but is not in itself any evidence of an interweave. Some of his conclusions, such as the use of a water soluble gum, lack credibility. No he wrote “In any case, this watersoluble, easily hydrolyzed gum would have been removed completely by the cleaning procedures used on the dated samples” (http://www.shroud.it/ROGERS 3.PDF pg. 193). And how can you say that his conclusion lacks credidibility on what basis? 7) The presence or absence of vanillin could be significant, as I have already said. So how do you cope with that? 8) Gilbert Raes discovered no differences between his sample and the Shroud. Later studies on the Shroud itself have attempted to show that the cotton content, if any, of the rest of the Shroud does not match that of the Raes sample. Whether the cotton is relevant or not is, as I have said above and many times before, dependant on rather better estimations of its quantity and location than have been determined so far.

Do not guess, use calculator instead: http://calculus calculator.com/statistics/chi squared distribution calculator.html However, my principle point remains the same. Assuming the same sample was being tested, the probability of obtaining the Shroud results by chance is only 1 in 20. This is not a very high probability, and it falls below the chi squared 0.05 value of 5.99 (95% sure that the values are from the same sample). As I say, this means that the hypothesis that the measurements are from the same sample is not considered formally established. This is not the same as saying that it has been disproved. As I say above, there is still a good chance that they are. It’s not that. One should be extremely careful in understanding what all those terms mean. Generally we can say, that SIGNIFICANCE is the probability of OBTAINING the result of TEST STATISTICS as stated value or above, ASSUMING (this is the key here) the random scatter. That is if all scatter is random, what is a chance that the result will be x or higher. The point is that if the obtained value is higher than critical value (which is a little bit arbitrary, depenent on significance level we choose as critical), we should reject the ASSUMPTION that there is nothing but random scatter. In short: 5 % is NOT a probability that there is only a random scatter but the probability of obtaining value higher than critical, if there is ONLY random scatter. I cannot agree with your next point, which is that the Riani/Atkinson findings mean that the medieval date must be rejected altogether. A row of dates along a plank of wood, for example, also show a chronological gradient, but are not, on that basis, rejected altogether. The reasons for the gradient along the wood are different, and better understood, but the principle is the same. Riani and Atkinson’s findings say nothing about the overall accuracy of the date of the Shroud. This is apples and oranges. We know that there is a row of dates along a plank of wood, because trees grow for several years contrary to the Shroud. And Riani/Atkinson do not say that medieval date must be rejected only that 1260 1390 is unreliable. The Shroud may be from 12th, 7th, 1st century, or 3rd century BC we don’t know its true age. But what we know, we cannot consider 1260 1390 as reliable, as there is a mix of older and newr material, of unknown relative ages and ratio! Why Rogers’ water soluble gum would have been applied I can’t understand. As you say, that would have been washed off by the cleaning process. It would also have been washed off by a shower of rain. What was it for? It is a nonsense revealing your purpose.

The Image of Edessa was rediscovered in 525, or 544 CE. The Image of Camoulia served as Imperial Banner already in 574. According to Pfeiffer, the Image of Camoulia was sent to Rome in 705, just before the first iconoclasm began. In 944 the Mandylion was brought to Constantinople. By 969 (letter of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos to his troops) Byzantine Empire had also alleged shroud of Christ among its collection of relics. If Mandylion=Shroud, then the original Mandylion had to be replaced by a copy. In 1204 the shroud with the image of Christ was stolen from Constantinople, according to Robert de Clari. By this time, the tradition of Veronica in Rome began. In 1247 the “Holy Towel” (probably the copy of Mandylion, to replace the original) was sent by Latin Emperor Baldwin II to Louis IX. He sent him also a 30 cm strip from the shroud of Christ, part of which is now in Toledo, and we know it doesn’t come from the Shroud of Turin it had to be another linen.

When we finally come to the other side, we will be really surprised. “There is more in the box: how come the face on all those icons and paintings, beginning with the sixth century encaustic icon preserved at Saint Catherine’s Monastery in the Sinai desert, correspond to the face on the TS and not to the one seen on the Manoppello veil?” I said something different. Resch fitted Manoppello Veil face proportions to the Good Shepherd, who is completely not Shroud type. Some sceptics tried to ridicule this method trying to fit Shroud face to that of Leoanrdo or Buddha, see http://greatshroudofturinfaq.com/Crazy/leonardo.html Dan: “The arguments continue: The face on the Shroud looks like Leonardo. Yes, it does, somewhat. It looks like many people sporting beards. Picknett and Prince go further. We are told that very precise comparative measurements to Leonardo’s face have been made.

The blood comes both from thehair and side of the face, as suggested by Lavoie. This is evident when you make some proper measurements and some digital processing of the images. First look at those Shroud Scope measurements The lenght from the tip of the nose to the blood mark (around 9 cm) in the hair is perfectly consistent with what one would expect about the distance from the tip of the nose to the side of the cheek.

I am not certain whether our views are similar, or different. You wrote: It was a specific discussion of the few rivulet looking blood stains on the side of the face. Do you mean side of the head (cheeks area, ~90 degrees from the nose) or frontal (face) side of the head? Because we may understand the term different. They certainly cannot come from the scalp. Perhaps from the cheek as you wrote, not the scalp, but I do not think this is the case either, explained at length in the paper that the Shroud was not flattened I presented at Dallas in 2005. In fact, this is the case, but, this does not contradicts your 2005 paper, in fact only strenghtens it. I definetly agree that the Shroud was not flattened it couldn’t have been But this does not exclude the bloodmarks in the cheek area and the presence of hair there also. Let me explain this. First the Shroud layout on the face: Yellow line is the flat reference surface (flattened Shroud, which we reject). Red line is the Shroud in strict contact with the body the contact image (which leads to consideable distortions, so we reject that hypothesis). Blue line is the Shroud being stretched while wrapping the face. This is the most likely position of the Shroud while the body image was created leading to moderate distortions. That’s what you have shown in the paper. Next we have projection mechanism: Where: 1. Vertical projection 2. Projection perpendicular to the body 3. Projection perpendicular to the sheet 4. Projection via the lines of the closest distance between body and sheet. You conjectured that the most likely projection mechanism is 4. Yet, in your paper you assumed 1. For its simplicity. Most people also assume mechanism 1.(verical projection on the sheet), even not being aware of the problem. It appears to be “natural”, so most people adopts it by default. But this leads to considerable delusion, if any other mechanism is correct. If other mechanism of projection than vertical is invoked, the results on the flat sheet would be different. For example 4. We apparently see hair being a few centimeter to the side of the face, separated from them by dark areas. But this is illusion! If you take some measurements via Shroud Scope, and compare it with meauserents perfromed on a living men, using simple elastic tape measure (which reflects approximately the shape of the linen wrapped around the face), it is obvious that the hair must be next to the face. This is further strenghten by the 3 D relation the intensity of the hair area is similar to that of the face. Further, if you eliminate dark bands, it is apparent that the image is continuous between the face and the hair thus clearly showing that the hair must be closely bound to the sides of the face. No other option. The only solution is the presented Mask of Agamemnon. It was once normal mask, a 3 D block covering the normal face but was forcefully flatten by collpasing roof. Similarly, the Shroud once wrapped 3 D shape a 3 D head. But as the sheet is flat due to its nature, the resultatnt body image is distorted in a similar way the Mask of Agamemnon is. You need some 3 D imagination to correctly perceive it +plus perhaps digital elimination of bandings. Their use by the Shroud Creator to give us impression of looking at undistorted face is absolute masterpiece!.","date":"2015-01-07","mins":"12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?"},{"id":"comment-181887","author":"o_k","post":"Mario: Can the frontal bloodstains come from the hair?

Note: A demonstration that the blood stains can come from the skin is not a proof that they cannot come from the hair. It is not a binary situation (either from the hair or from the skin). Actually they come from both skin and hair. The blood marks on the face side are actually in the positions indicated by Lavoie, in the cheeks.But the hair are also in this area, tightly bound to the face. What misleads people is the misconception that hair are away from the cheeks. Actually they are exactly on the cheeks.

So only the most fresh bloodmarks, created just before (or shortly after) death could have been reflected. This mean that the Shroud image doesn’t reproduce the full amount of blood present on the body in fact only small percent, which may be misleading. Presumably whole body and hair were covered with blood. So I adjusted color balance of the photo of wounded gentleman but exactly in opposite way to what David Mo has done, reducing amount of red, and showing only the most prominent blood tracks.

Not a smidgin. The crease is modern. No old painting can be based upon it. I would not depend on a single photo, no matter Pia, Enrie, Miller, Schwortz, as the visibility of the crease may depend on lighting parameters. Nevertheless, the crease is (although barely) visible on the Shroud Scope’s Durante photos. I don’t understand your reference to the Manopello painting, which probably dates to the late middle ages. That means you know very little about Manoppello Image. Now, why don’t paintings show a uniform collection of abnormalities? Are we to suppose that every pantocrator painter had personal experience of the shroud, and they each picked out their own selection of imperfections? Some went for forked beards, some didn’t notice that the beard was forked but did spot a minutely visible imperfection in the weave between the eyes? The arbitrary selection of this or that characteristic is, I think, the main argument against these Vignon markings having credibility. This seems strange when artists are supposed to have studied the shroud in such detail as to copy minute imperfections of the weave as if they were essential parts of their reproductions. How should I make more clear to all those sceptics, that most of those images are copies of the copies of the images derived from the Shroud? That’s why the choice is arbitrary in several cases. Those are paintings, not photocopies. Besides, as we noted, even photographs may differ basing on their parameters, so what to say about paintings. The St Catherine’s Pantocrator is one of the earliest. It seems to come from Constantinople in the 6th century. It shows no sign of having been derived from the shroud. The major features, the droopy moustache, the long pointed beard, the round shape of the hair around the head, and so on, bear no resemblance to the shroud. Even the asymmetric eyebrows and the bag under the left eye owe nothing to the shroud. Look carefully. The other Pantocrator you link to is in Delphi, in Greece. This one is also typical of its group which represent a more graphic and sylised art form, with lots of well defined lines on the forehead and neck. There is possibly a greater case to be made here for derivation from the shroud, but I still don’t think the case holds water. Again, look carefully. Count the number of similarities to the Shroud. All in all, I’m still not persuaded that the “Vignon markings” have any cogency. They have. But they are not everything. Every icon is specific and has its own similarities to the Shroud.

We had a look at this last December (The Sciatica Effect, Dec 28 2013), and I queried the existence specifically of the celebrated “double crease” under the chin, said to be the source of so many of those Byzantine portraits of Christ with a double line at the top of his tunic. As it was discussed, the “double crease” is visible under appropriate conditions. Besides, one should decide what is more important, the “double” or “crease”, which is very often represented as low collar on Christ’s tunic. The neck is alos often emphasized, another common trait with the Shroud, just see http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Meister von Daphni 002.jpg As for the two strands of hair, they do not appear at all on the shroud, and I am not at all persuaded that they are representations of the epsilon blood drip ‘translated’ into hair. But they appear here: http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%C5%82un z Manoppello#mediaviewer/Plik:Volto Santo 01.jpg Anyway, it is one of the most characteristic features on the majority (but not all) of the Byzantine icons. Whether they are derived from the Shroud aka Mandylion or Manoppello aka Camuliana (it could be from either of them) is a secondary issue. Three of the Vignon markings, which appear to exist on the shroud, are really only one, namely the open square, the shallow V inside it and the droopy V below it. The square is easily the most visible, but apart from the Roman catacomb painting (what was the shroud doing in Rome, one wonders?) most of the paintings which are claimed to have derived from the shroud seem to have omitted the square altogether in favour of the V markings. How odd. There is no icon with all 15 markings. Those three are not one and the same, instead one of them is usually picked. On Daphni Pantocrator there are all 3. The Rome pantocrator is likely based on some other icon derived directly from the Shroud most of those paintings are copies of copies, second or third generation from the Shroud. As for the nose and cheeks, there is, very properly, no sign of any bruising or battering on the Byzantine portraits. On the glorius Pantocrator? Are you crazy? Nevertheless, look at the Sinai painting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg It is a face of a boxer, isn’t it? They nearly all show their subject turned slightly towards, and illuminated by, light from the right. Not only does this reduce the area of cheek visible on the right, but also means that there is a greater area of cheek, and more shadow, on the left. I do not feel this establishes that this asymmetry in the depiction of the nose and cheeks is derived from the shroud. Again, this is artistic interpretation, based on.. What? How do you think, what was the origin of this tradition? As for the moustache and beard, it is obvious that the general shape of a Byzantine moustache looks nothing like that of the man in the shroud. His is quite bushy and bulges around the nostrils; theirs consists of two long straight diagonals with a little tuft in the middle. If anything, this style of moustache clearly shows that these portraits are not derived from the shroud You should be happy that there is even a mustache separeted from the beard! Demanding that the mustache must be ideally copied from the Shroud is just splitting hairs. But look again on the Sinai Pantocrator. Byzantine depictions of beards, surely the most prominent and distinctive of features (I have a beard myself, dear reader) are split about 50/50 forked or pointed. Not a clear derivation from the shroud, in my opinion. I would say it is more than 50/50 for forked than pointed. But you should look also for other characters, and I think in their case it is far less than 50/50 forked to pointed. And finally, leaving aside all the markings, once again the basic question: Why every child recognizes this face, while there is nowhere in the Scripture written how he looked like? This is the very basic question, most academic (pseudo)scholars never asked!.","date":"2014-04-26","mins":"2:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/26/how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"id":"comment-104066","author":"o_k","post":"Fair enough.

Only the combination of several of them makes the valid case + some other features, like analysis of proportions, some common traits of overwhelming majority of Jesus portraits (like long hair for example).

See http://www.shroud.com/shroudfr.gif and compare with http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Full length negatives of the shroud of Turin.jpg Where is the upper crease just above the head, for example? The point about the Vignon markings is that they appear on images and “cannot be artistically justified except with reference to the shroud.” And there’s no doubt that the Roman catacomb portrait does have a big meaningless square between the brows. It is, however, the only instance of that in all the images I have seen (It is not one of OK’s examples). All the others, and every instance of the supposed “forehead streak” and most of the “V”s, are perfectly reasonable deliniations of the supra orbital ridges and bulge of the forehead, and need owe nothing to any supposed imperfections on the shroud. A very few images, it is true, have well defined, and apparently meaningless well defined curvy lines, loops and triangles drawn across the brows, and these, I agree, need explaining, but they look nothing like the faint imperfections on the shroud. OK, like most “Vignon spotters” somewhat arbitrarily assigns these to “topless squares,” and the two supposed V’s within and below them. This means that either you, or those who maintain this, does not understand what’s going on. There are no unique Vignon markings. All of them can find some non Shroud explanation. But the key is that they, even if stylishly incorporated as either “supra orbital ridges and bulge of the forehead” or anything else (which is just artistic interpretation) are present on those portraits (along with several other marks). Why? Isn’t it an attempt to “naturalize” some barely visible signs on the Shroud which origin they didn’t understand? They are not always visible at first glance but they are, even if just symbolically marked. But one needs to carefully and patiently observe those icons what, I suppose, you do not, instead judging from the first impression. Remember, 2 3 marks means nothing they may be accidental. But 5 6 are significant. A single casual glance at the image on the shroud shows a roughly rectangular face with no visible ears, a bushy moustache and a short, stubby, split beard. Astonishingly, in spite of their alleged study of minute differences between single threads, not a single one of OK’s images can be so described. Byzantine artists probably never got close enough to see any of the alleged weave imperfection markings at all. Hugh, I want to underline this : those are not exact photocopies of the image on the Shroud. Instead, they are usually copies of copies of images derived from the Shroud Most of the artists that painted those, never saw the Shroud. But they saw some other similar icons (derived from the Shroud) with some strange, unexplained markings on them, which they dutifully marked on another copies. Without asking unnecessary questions: why. It is not about reproducing photographically the shape of the nose or bird, symbollism and mystery are much more important in the icon business. There is a forked beard, so let there be forked beard, there is a small traingle between eye, or two little strands of hair, so let it be. They don’t have to look exactly the same, but they must be represented in some way, because it is some “theological mystery”, to say at least. Even more surprising, perhaps, is the fact that Vignon’s own sketch (if so it be; it seems the most reproduced) of his markings looks nothing like the shroud face either! A simple overlay test, such as is much beloved by the Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer and Akiane Kramarik schools of thought, shows no comparison at all. That’s no truth at all Hugh! What about this https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/image44.png Or this: http://www.theanimationacademy.com/an/Jesus Shroud7a.jpg or this paper of Resch (of whom I have not a high opinion, truly saying) http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Resch Web.pdf 1) Of course I’m a more authoritative observer than Vignon. So is anybody else. Vignon would have given his eye teeth for shroudscope or Shroud 2.0. His 1938 book was based on Enrie’s photographs, which, however good for their time, are nothing like as good as the ones we have today. And what have I used – isn’t it 2002 Durante from Shroud Scope? 2) I do not deny that all these marks (apart from the hairstrands and the crease) are distinguishable in one form or another on the shroud. What I deny is that perfectly natural depictions of the contours of the brow, on the one hand, or precisely delineated wavy lines with loops and triangles, on the other, are obviously derived from these markings.</I. So Hugh, let me ask a rhetorical question, if those are not derived from the Shorud, than from what? Look more carefully, Hugh.

And I have already agreed that the style of pantocrator with the distinct wavy lines and triangles is one such anomaly. What I don’t agree in that case is that these designs are obviously derived from the shroud. If not from the Shroud, than from what? I cannot find any better model, and the number of similarities between those icons and the Shroud is striking. They are not direct proof, but the number and frequency of Shroud similar points (not only Vignon marks, which have some flaws, but no one suggested better set) is also far above what one could expect from simply random occurences. I’m afraid I’m not taken in by any of OK’s superpositions. All faces have eyes and mouths, and any two full face portraits can be related so that these features coincide. You are inconsistent. You claimed before that A simple overlay test, such as is much beloved by the Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer and Akiane Kramarik schools of thought, shows no comparison at all. And I showed that it is exactly opposite. Overlay tests are useful, but they are frequently overused as proof for some strange ideas (Leonardo or Good Shepherd examples), so they cannot be considered conclusive. It is a combination of those + some minute details like Vignon markings + some general similarities + some common sense (it is absurd to look for Vignon marks on the Virgin Mary icons for example, because even if they appear sometimes, they are obviously not derived directly from the Shroud) to make a good case. The fact remains that the most obvious and easiest to copy features of the face on the Shroud are not reflected in any of the Byzantine portraits, with their ovoid faces, with narrowed chins or beards, droopy moustaches and visible ears. Hugh, those are exactly the features of the Shroud face, and they are reflected on those Byzantine portrait. Strange you can’t see it. Watch the Durante photo in my paper carefully, it is exactly ovoid face, with very (even pathologically) narrowed chin and jaw, especially on the right (from the viewers perspecitve) side! Compare it with Sinai Pantocrator. Have you even read my remarks about that face? See also the droopy mustache and compare it with the Shroud, it ends abruptly on the right side much closer to the centre than on the left side, exactly the same as on the Durante’s photo. What about right skewed nose? What about scar on the neck, just in the very similar place like on the Durante’s photo? Haven’t you noticed that? As to the ears, they were simply added by Byzantine artists. Jesus, as being fully human, obviously had to have both ears. I don’t expect them to be photocopies, and no doubt most of them were copies of copies, but it is disingenuous to claim on the one hand that the copiers were only vaguely accurate about what they were depicting en large, but fanatically careful to include minute details – for mystery’s sake. See above. And one another thing see the gallery of painted Shroud copies.

A few days ago you dismissed my wide range of non Christ portraits carrying Vignon markings because, as they didn’t have shoulder length hair, they couldn’t possibly be derived from the Shroud. Now you seem to be a staunch defender of the Spanish Pantocrator, even though, as it has short hair, by your own repeated and insistent criteria, it cannot be derived from the Shroud, and therefore any Vignon markings it may posess are accidental! To every rule, there are some exceptions.For example, the Mandylion from Skylitzes (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Surrender of the Mandylion to the Byzantines.jpg )has no recognizable shoulder lenght hair, but surprisingly it has two strands of hair. We can say that one “Christ style” dominates from the 6th century, but what about Michelangelo? http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Michelangelo%2 C Giudizio Universale 03.jpg When I said: “Jesus without long hair is not Jesus”, of course I meant general, not absolute rule. And frankly, I expected that sceptics would be trying to play red herring with it. That would show how despearate measures they need to utilize. There are not absolute criteria, and even Vignon marks have some flaws, though no one has yet suggested better system. What one needs is some common sense, which is dismissed by so favored byt he sceptics overconcentration on particular elements. Are there multiple Vignon marks on Byzantine potraits of Christ? They are there in majority of cases, and no one except most prejudiced sceptics deny this. Are there Vignon marks on non Christs? Yes, sometimes, but they are minority. It is obvious that on non Christs they cannot be derived from the Shroud but in the case of the Christs they can, and are the frequency of their presence is simply too high, and there are other notable similarites with the Shroud (beard, long hair, similar proportions etc.). Possible minor differences (ears, no blood traces) can be easily, and rationally explained. And that’s the whole philosophy. As to the Spanish Pantocrator, one can argue that there is long hair, hidden at the back of the head it is definetly not short hair. But that it would be unkind, one would feel like asking you the question you asked of Mo, wouldn’t one? In the case of David Mo, I hardly believe he didn’t notice marks 12 & 15 at last.

Jesus beardless and with the short hair was an icon that persisted till the first centuries of the Middle Age. And John the Baptist was ever presented with long hair and sometimes with a curl on the front. This has no necessary relation to the Shroud nor the actual appearance of Christ but to some theological conventions. Jesus with a beard and long hair was assimilated to the philosophers and Wisdom. Jesus beardless was the symbol of the Life. Cf: Chavanne Mazel, Claudine A.: “Popular Belief and the Image of Beardless Christ”, Visual Resources, Vol 19, no 1; 2003; p. 19 24. It is on line, I think. First thanks for the article, it is indeed interesting. It shows clearly that the further from Constantinople, the dominance of long hair, bearded, skinny Christ comes later. But this dominance since the 6th century is undisputable, and some exceptions confirming the rule cannot change that! And all the theories that development of such image occurred without influence of the Shroud are in fact nothing but pure academic speculations based on no evidentiary basis at all! We enlarge arbitrarily the rank of our survey. For example, we accept the Pantocrator of Taüll but not the Pantocrator of the Cristo de la Luz of Toledo. Why? Because we think the first accomplish (?? I doubt a lot) some Vignon Marks and the latter not a single one. That’s not true. There are several marks on the latter (http://www.arteguias.com/imagenes/cristoluzpinturas.jpg ), for example 1, perhaps 2 or 3, 12, 15, maybe more. Are you blinded or simply lying? How long the influence of the Shroud reached ? How? These are some important points to an historical hypothesis never specified in this case. It lasts up to this day, as I have shown a couple posts above. For practical reason I would consider only the period 500 1350, between discovery of Image of Edessa and the first appearance of the Shroud in Lirey. I hope this criterion is clear. The influence of the Shroud on Christ iconography post 1350 is beyond any discussion, as I will show one day. The influence in a period before 1350 (when , according to the sceptics, Shroud didn’t exist) as well. In what sense ‘oddity’? I think they are a ‘stilyzed’ sign, perhaps of concentration and power. (‘Stylization’: a natural feature modified in terms of an aesthetic style). But they scarcely ever or never appear as a vertical succesion of signs in form of V+rectangular box+V (2,3,4 marks) in the space between the eyebrows. Not in the Shroud, of course. They are rarely present all three (usually one or two), but on the Daphne Pantocrator they are all three, very expressly highlighted (why? ad hoc ideas about “stilyzed’ signs, perhaps of concentration and power.” don’t hold water) http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Meister von Daphni 002.jpg And they are certainly noticeable on the Shroud. Closing eyes and denying this don’t help you, David Mo. Yes on the non Christ they are accidental. On the Christ they are related to the Shroud. Petitio principii. You suppose the Mandylion is the Srhoud. This is far to be demonstrated. I suppose nothing about the Mandylion at this moment. I simply notice that frequency of the oddities known as Vignon marks is far beyond from what one could expect from mere random occurrences (the case of non Christ icons). And the very similar oddities can be found on the Shroud. Reasonable conclusion: they are derived from the Shroud.

The marks 5, 6 7 or 8 are practically inexistent, the same as the combination 2, 3 and 4. The mark 13 has two different ways of representation It is true that some of the marks are more frequent than others (see the table at the end of my presentation https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/shroudvignonpantocratorsmandylions.pdf ), but this not mean that those are not present on some (sometimes very significant) examples (for example Sinai for 5 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg and Hagia Sophia for 6,7, 8 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Christ Pantocrator Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg ) The combination of 2, 3, 4 is present on multiple examples, although rarely all three (Daphni is the most striking example http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Meister von Daphni 002.jpg ) The mark 13 can be represented in various ways, but the most important point is that it is represented. First problem: Marks 1, 10, 11 and 13 in both forms are common marks to a lot of portraits of these times and even before. Then, we have only two marks that can be considered identifying of Christ: 12 (divided beard) and 15 (lock of hair). I agree that marks 1,10,11,13 can be quite common on several portraits (though not all, and not in any context or style like in the case of the Christ), but then, even if we agree to your deeply sceptical interpretation, we have marks 12 and 15 as decisive factor (that means 12 & 15 +those mentioned before) during examination. But in some portraits of John the Baptist (for example) we can see the same lock of hair. Evidently here it doesn’t represent any blood stain, but only a lock of hair. Why do you think that the same lock of hair represents a blood stain in the Byzantine representation of Christ? Have you any reason to think so? Surely not. I haven’t heard any explanation of this arbitrary interpretation. One should remember that John the Baptist was born just a half year before his cousin Christ, so he is often portayed in the fashion similar to the latter. So in some occasions, he “inherited” the lock from Jesus. And that’s nothing unimaginable. See this modern icon of St. Joseph with baby Jesus ( http://lodztrojmasztowa.bloog.pl/id,337752810,title,Ikona modlitwa wschodu,index.html?smoybbtticaid=612b9f , below Pantocrator). Baby Jesus has a lock of hair, so has Joseph, who is clearly portrayed in a manner similar to adult Jesus. It has some improtance in this particular artistic expression. So, even in the supposition that the 15 Vignon’s marks were present in the Shroud (and I don’t see more of six or seven), there is not any “extraordinary coincidence” between these marks and the Byzantine iconography of Christ when we examine better the facts.” I can see all 15, (and can suggest some more) and there is clearly the coincidence, contrary to the other figures not related to the Shroud, like Moses, Elijah, St. Nicholas, Constantine or any other..","date":"2014-05-15","mins":"4:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"id":"comment-119766","author":"o_k","post":"Why?

Criticism acknowledged. However the fact is that it is impossible to determine where beards end and hairs begin on those icons. – The Christ of the Shroud has rings under de eyes. (???) And leptons. Yes indeed, it has some brighter ellipse rings around the eyes. – You do a ‘liberal’ intrpretation of mark 14 (rings under the eyes). But then, almost all the roman portraits of adult men, specially philosophers and emperors, have the same mark. It is not a characteristic feature of portrait of Christ! Nobody needed to copy nothing, but follow a pictorical convention thoroughly established. I don’t know what do you mean by the term liberal. I admit that this mark is problematic, as it is unclear what “heavily accented owlish eyes” actually means. Nevertheless, this is a feature that is visible on several icons those black eyes, like after some boxing fight, or three nights without sleep. The Sinai Pantocrator with its squint eyes is the most striking example. I cannot imagine how they could paint it without the reference to the Shroud. – You believe that two or three hairs sometimes almost invisible (VIII) are “similar” and “inspired” by a strong spiral form of blood(Shroud). (???) In Spain we say that this analogy “está traída por los pelos” ( is farfetched; literally: ‘brought by the hair’). Never better said. Have you any reason to suppose the first artist’s intention that converted the blood to hair or it is a mere supposition? Striking, or almost invisible, the most important point is their presence. The Byzantine icons ususally (although not always) have real obsession on this strand of hairs.as they are present even on miniatures http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mandylion#mediaviewer/File:Surrender of the Mandylion to the Byzantines.jpg So there must have been something important in those strands (even if they are just symbollically marked), for, if we forget the blood mark on the Shroud or similar strand on Manoppello (assuming it is identical to Camuliana Image, as Pfeiffer suggest), otherwise unknown reasons. You should not be blamed by have claimed these nonsense. Vingnon’s theory is based on remote analogies and statements of intentions without any verifiable support. I have never concealed that Vignon’s system has some weak points it mixes absolute marks (like 9, 12 or 15) with relative ones (6,7, 14). Besides marks 10 and 11 are usually related. Nevertheless, although flawed as it is, it allows for some basic systematic survey of all those icons, and makes a point, that there are several similarities between Shroud and Byzantine images of Christ. But the matter is of course much more complex, and one cannot stay just with the Vignon only. There are probably the whole famillies of genetically related icons there is some equivalent of “textual criticism” needed. Each icon has also its own specific similarites to the Shroud, not listed among Vignon marks. One could expand or revise that system. Besides there are some basic similiarites of proportions, and basic feature: long hair, presence of beard and mustache, thin nose, skinny face, and so on. Dave B: It would seem that Paul Vignon was better informed 76 years ago than his amateur critics are today. Suggestion – Obtain a copy of Vignon’s 1938 publication, and then comment when adequately informed of his studies, in preference to whistling in the dark!

You speak of a table in your presentation but I don’t see any one. Sorry, this was a link to the old version. Here is updated: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/pantocratorsmarks.pdf This is not any reason. This is an ad hoc supposition. You and I can “imagine” a lot of things. But they are mere speculation before we be able to provide a proof of them. Meanwhile a lock of hair is a lock of hair and two locks of hair are two locks of hair. There is a lot of speculation floating around, and even more in the views of art historians. The only solid materials are the Shroud and the icons. DM: Why do you think that the same lock of hair represents a blood stain in the Byzantine representation of Christ? Have you any reason to think so? They have similar shape, simply. And the easiest way to represent this epsilon shape on the glorious Pantocrators and Mandylions is with the use of hair lock. Of course the audience don’t know the true nature of it. Painters, if the whole Shroud had not been fully unveiled, perhaps also. And the form of the wrinkle in the neck of the Shroud (that actually is not) is very different of the wrinkle of the neck of the most part of Christ’s images we are analyzing. But these latter are very similar to many roman portraits. I think you will be able to extract the adequate inference. That wrinkle, or rather the whole base of the neck visible on the Shroud, can be interpreted in various ways, and both representations you showed can be justified. Just look carefully at the neck area on the Shroud. Just look a little bit below that wrinkle, there some U shaped area, similar to the mark 2. The sole feature common to the Shroud and the standard representation of Christ in the medieval art that might be clearly observable is the divided beard. All the other are based either on subjective vision or ad hoc inferences. And those ad hoc intreferences are indeed in those places on the shorud isn’t that remarkable? As to the subjective vision, everyone has it’s own.

Copernican Revolution?? Yes, Copernican Revoltion. Accepting that the most common image of Jesus since at least 6th century is in fact derived from the Shroud of Turin, would be Copernican Revolution in Christian art studies. It would be like moving from geocentrism to heliocentrism. But the Copernican Revolution you claim becomes a ridiculous thing if the sole historian you quote is against the method of Vignon with at least a similar argument as I have done here. See “THE SHROUD OF TURIN AND THE FACE OF CHRIST IN PALEOCHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE AND WESTERN MEDIEVAL ART”: “Vignon was a scholar of the natural sciences, of chemistry and biology. His iconographic arguments in regard to the Shroud therefore lack a bit of exact methodology. He was not sufficiently acquainted with the very vast range of the diverse images of Christ nor the variety of details they show”. (p. 12) and it goes further: “Vignon is right when he affirms that a resemblance exists between the classic type of the face of Christ and the Shroud face. He is right when he says that certain deformities on the Shroud face are due to the maltreatment Christ suffered during the different stages of his passion. If identical traces are found in art works representing Christ, Vignon reasoned, then these art works must be seen as dependent on the Turin relic. These same disfiguring marks seen on the Shroud face are indeed found on images of Christ but, Vignon added, they are found also on other personages. This, for art historians, is the weak spot in Vignon’s argument. In establishing a connection not only between the Shroud and images of Christ, but also with images of other persons, Vignon went beyond the limits of a method of certainty. He was the first to compare the sindonic face with the diverse art images, the first to introduce a method fundamentally sound (boldings mine), but he did not realize its limitations. Therefore, even though we owe so much to Vignon, we will take a different path.” Do not take sentences out of context.

Assad is a doctor who studied in England while his wife studied in an Anglican school there. Yeah, yeah. And what does it mean little in fact, except that Assad is much smarter than many other dictators. But that’s clearly misleading. The Assad famiglia is classical model of mafia, ruling Syria for over 40 years. And Bashar is the current Godfather in elegant suit, even despite in fact his hands are up to elbows covered with blood. It always seems to be a choice between two evils. After Saddam was overthrown, the aftermath in Iraq was worse than the disease. Getting rid of him was no solution, but has brought mayhem and destruction to Iraq. The same situation is likely to occur in Iran. Get rid of Assad will almost certainly result in radical Islamism taking control of whatever revolution follows, and Christian people and places of worship will certainly be targeted. Assad realises that the western powers will be aware of this, and it serves him as a counter trump to continue his own atrocities. That’s exactly what regimes like Assad’s or Iranian Ayatollahs want us, Westerners, to think. You need us in power, because the alternative is Al Qaeda. So why blame Assad? He tried to get the opposition to talk, but they wouldn’t listen. Once again, don’t be naive Louis. The talks between opposition and Assad? The only language they know is crushing rebellion with tanks. They are gangsta, you know. Why? Because they are backed by al Nusra, A/Q and hundreds of fundamentalist, fanatical Chechen, Saudi Arabian, Iraqi mercenaries, financed by Saudi Arabian petrodollars. Yeah, yeah, by everyone except Assad. And that makes him suspect. Looking at the course of the Iraq War from 2003 it was obvious that the greatest stream of men, money and material was going from Syria via the Anbar province. But for political reasons there was silence of this in the most media. It was far easier to blame the Bush administration (they committed several errors I admit, but world wide anti Bush hysteria at that time was something quite unprecedented in history). Have you seen what Prince Charles and Prime Minister David Cameron said about protecting Christians recently? Are they badly informed? Have you seen the plight of Christians in Pakistan? Where was B/L found? The military there didn’t know anything about it? Why is Pakistan getting even more closer to Saudi Arabia? No, Louis, I haven’t. And that’s the problem, that West has fallen into powerlessness and decadence. This is the same reason why Putin is doing in the Ukraine whatever he wants he knows that West is degenerated and cowardly. The LGBT privileges are often far more important than fundamentals of the Western civilization.

Which resulted in mulitple amnesties once captured the Saddamists terrorists were being released from captivity, as a “good will” gesture (or rather incredible stupidity) which resulted in more and more innocent victims. Here you have example: 02 Dec 2010 Source: reuters // Reuters * Iraq says 39 al Qaeda suspects arrested * Third highest leader in Iraq among those captured * Raids produce identities, photos of top two Qaeda leaders By Muhanad Mohammed BAGHDAD, Dec 2 (Reuters) – Iraq said on Thursday its security forces had arrested 39 al Qaeda militants, including the group’s leadership in Anbar province and one of its top officers in Iraq, in raids over the last five weeks. The group carried out car bombings and attacks against police in Anbar, a former al Qaeda stronghold; recruited and equipped suicide bombers from abroad and plotted attacks on government ministries, Interior Minister Jawad al Bolani told a news conference. The raids also gave security forces the real names, and photographs, of al Qaeda’s two top leaders in Iraq, officials said. “The repeated and painful blows to al Qaeda, by the killing and arrests of its leadership, will lead to the demise of al Qaeda in Iraq,” Bolani said at a news conference in Baghdad. Bolani identified one of the captured men, Hazim al Zawi, as al Qaeda’s third highest leader in Iraq and the “security minister” of its local affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq. Thirty eight of the men, wearing orange prison uniforms, were led into the news conference. Zawi was brought into the room wearing a black hood, which was pulled off to allow photographers and TV cameramen to take pictures of his face. Iraqi and U.S. Forces struck a major blow against the Islamist militant group in April when al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Ayyub al Masri, and Abu Omar al Baghdadi, the head of ISI, were killed in a raid. Military officials said the deaths were a serious setback to a stubborn insurgency that still unleashes attacks daily, more than seven years after the U.S. led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein. Among those arrested, officials said, was Ibrahim al Zobai, al Qaeda’s “deputy war minister,” who had been in charge of bringing Arab suicide bombers into Iraq since 2004. Security forces also captured Ahmed al Essawi, a religious adviser in ISI, Ali al Fahdawi, an ISI administrator and Abdul Razaq Albu Essa, the group’s head of media, authorities said. General Dhiya Hussein, the head of the Interior Ministry’s counter terrorism department, said the raids enabled security forces to obtain pictures and learn the real names of al Qaeda’s two top leaders, the men who replaced Masri and Baghdadi. “The successful arrest operation connected us to the head of the terrorist organization, Ibrahim Awad al Samarrai, who was known as Abu Baker al Baghdadi, and his war minister, Nuaman Salman, who was known as Abu Suleiman before,” Hussein said. Many of those arrested were held in U.S. Custody at one time but were released as a result of political deals and had gone back to the insurgency, Bolani said. “We call on the politicians not to repeat the past mistakes. Don’t let the criminals escape from punishment,” he said. Last week Iraqi officials announced the arrests of 12 suspected al Qaeda militants in connection with an Oct. 31 attack on a Baghdad Christian church in which 52 hostages and police were killed.

It began years ago when I was invited for coffee and an opportunity to meet and talk to the Iraqi prelate Mor Severios Jamil Hava, bishop of Baghdad, which was preceded by the usual two hour mass celebrated in Aramaic.

The thing that concerns me here is not Putin, but praising Bashar al Assad the Corleone of the Middle East.

Let the public opinion in the West turns against the further interventions!The Middle East regimes like Iran & Syria were aware, that after overthrowing Saddam, they are next in the line. That’s why over 100 000 innocent Iraqis died. And when popular unrest against Assad regime started in Syria, what was the obvious move?

Dave: How many other stories might there be telling of the journeys and destinations of Christ’s burial cloths? There seem to be several in the various apocryphal gospels and acts of pseudonymous apostles, and others. Might any of them have any substance? I have written a long article in Polish about all the relics of burial cloths venerated through the centuries, that were known to me (see footnote 3). I was discussing only objects which existence were testified by witnesses whosaw them with their own eyes, excluding various legends about St. Luke, or Pilate’s wife possesing some burial cloths. What I recommend to read, is Remi van Haelst article in footnote 4. It gave a lot of info to me. There is a very interesting problem of Charlemagne’s relics we know that around the year 800 he obtained, either from Jerusalem or Constantinople, two burial cloths, or possibly representative copies of them, the large Sudarium Domini, currently stored in Kornelimünster, and the so called Sindon Munda, divided between Kornelimünster and Compiègne. If we combine the two halves of the latter, we obtain a cloth about 4 metres long, 1 wide, very similar to the Shroud of Turin. Next comes the matter of Stuttgart Psalter, which was raised by Maxa Patricka von Hamon. The problem of the burial clothes is very complex, and its hard to find a satisfactory solution to it..","date":"2014-01-14","mins":"8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","title":"Arculfus’ Shroud:  A Guest Posting by O.K."},{"id":"comment-45792","author":"o_k","post":"Thanks..","date":"2013-09-29","mins":"6:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/29/blood-from-a-picture-of-christ-links-to-the-shroud/","cat":"history","title":"Blood from a picture of Christ: Links to the shroud?"},{"id":"comment-45826","author":"o_k","post":"Max: “Actually, this is the result of my personal archivistic research.

Most probably fake, perhaps “found” during the 1st Crusade in Antioch to boost the morale of the crusaders. * A linen shroud from Constantinople (distinct from the Shroud of Turin). Some pieces sent to Louis IX. Another candidate for Arculfus Shroud. *Arculfus Shroud. The greatest unknown it could have been any shroud mentioned above. *Sudarium of Oviedo. Bloodstains. * The Coif of Cahors. Wrapped around the head, binding the jaw. Bloodstains, no information about image. *The cotton sudarium from Constantinople, some fragments in Halberstadt. * Sudarium Capitis from Carcassonne. No traces of blood and image. Allegations that it was cut from The Shroud of Cadouin, or perhaps from some another cloth. * The Manoppello Veil, according to some recent hypotheses laid on the Shroud of Turin.

Hugh, I am not an expert in that field, but looking at those gold silver reliquaries, the prices seem to be relatively modest. I don’t think it pays off for the forgers to produce such reliquaries and sell them relatively cheap. And if they are original, and sealed then what? Not everything Remember, numerous wars ravaged Europe through the centuries. Looting was very common. It is hard to imagine how innumerable number of treasures circulate the black market outside any control of authorities. That’s why, instead of mockery, one should monitor that trade, to bring priceless items back under proper control. Not everything sold on flea market is a crappy forgery! However, this post has stimulated a thought. Given that almost every relic known to history has been chopped into innumerable fragments for dissemination among the faithful, including the crown of thorns, the nails, the cross and even the sepulchre, is it not surprising that the Shroud is so intact? The table of the last supper, everything the Holy Family ever wore – it’s all in shreds around the world. Only the Shroud remains substantially as it ever was, if it ever was, with only those two corners and a few stray threads missing. Because it has the image on it. That’s why it cannot be fragmented so easily. Vincenzo: Complete and total fraud, the true cross was destroyed by Saladin during the Crusades It is only partiallly true. The True cross was already fragmented in Sain Helena times. The Saladin’s booty was only small fragment of it. The total volume of True Cross is estimated to be between 36 000 cm^3, up to 178 000 cm^3, while the total amount of the alleged relics of True Cross is less than 4 000 cm^3.

The cross was slotted into a hole a stone ring (11.5 cm in diameter) serving for that purpose was found in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1986, see Witnesses of Mystery pg. 310 313. It is estimated the cross was no higher than say, 250 cm. The Good Theft Patibulum, currently in Rome’s Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (see Thiede&Ancona The Quest for The True Cross and Pierluigi Baima Bollone Sindone, 101 domande e risposte) is 178 (but originally it was probably longer, say 200 cm) x13 x 13cm. This gives us estimated cross volume of 59767 cm^3. Giving estimated wood density of 0.5 g/cm^3 this would give us about 30 kg. Contrary to widespread myth, it was entirely possible for a man to carry the whole cross. A small correction, if we assume density of 0.75 g/cm^3 this would give us about 45 kg As to the spiecies, the reports are hardly reliable. I have seen claims of oak, olive, pine, and cypress. Allowing for some misidentification, Hesemann claims that no more than 3 spiecies (for vertical and transverse beams, as well for Titulus which probably was made from walnut) could have been used.

But how many non Christ icons with several Vignon marks are there? A few? And how many Christ icons without Vignon marks? Also a few, I think. So if we limit ourselves to the Byzantine period, it is likely that we find, say 5 % non Christ icons with multiple Vignon markings and, say 5 % Christ icons without them. We only catch approximately the marks 2 and 3 if we contrast adequately a picture of small size in negative. Of course this is a resource that was not in reach of the people of the Byzantine Empire.

Right, I meant 1998 paper. I looked briefly on 2008 paper once, but had no time to study it in depth, I will do it so. Daveb of wellington nz : If Edessa was evangelised in apostolic times, why would it accept subjugation to the Antioch church? Perhaps because Antioch was much greater ciy than Edessa. And don’t forget about time of the first evangelization 30 AD, and subsequent pagan reaction. About 30 33 AD, Christianity was in embryonic form. About 57 AD the pagan rection in Edessa came. The Church structure much developed between 30 33 and 57 AD. The definite split with judaism came only after 70 AD, and destruction of the Temple. Before about 100 AD, the terms bishop and presbyter meant essencially he same. So it is nothing strange that Edessa was evangelised twice, first in the times of Abgar V, who just invited Jesus to his kingdom, and probably was not even aware that the new worlwide religion had already begun there, and for the second time during reign of Abgar VIII, when Church structure was much more developed, and Abgar VIII, influenced by his predecessor decided to adopt Christianity. Daveb of wellington nz The evangelisation of Edessa in apostolic times can only be speculative, more so than the Edessa image was the Shroud! There is no evidence that Edessa was evangelised much before 200 AD, only the Abgar tale, which postdates 200 AD! Eusebius was instructed by Pamphilus who was martyred in 310 AD, that’s way after 200 AD! The first indication of a church in Edessa, was a reference to a flood in 201 AD, in a Syriac chronicle, earliest extent edition of the 6th century. There is no evidnece, but on the other hand there are no serious reasons to doubt the event took place. Remember, the first real comprehenisve history of the Church is that of Eusebius written in the early 4th century. The Acts of the Apostles written by Luke, although very reliable source of information, are actually not history of the Church (and Luke never mentioned that he intended to write such one!), but history of the Paul! The accounts about Peter and early church of Jerusalem are most probably based on the accounts of Peter told Paul, see Galatians, Chapters 1 and 2. And Eusebius does not mention the second evangelization of Edessa around 200 AD. Outside telling the Abgar Story in Book 1, he does not mention Edessa at all! About lack of indications of evangelisation of Edessa during Abgar V in Syriac chronicle (you mean this http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronicle of edessa.htm ), remember this chronicle is very brief, and probably largely incomplete. Remeber that is very likely that Abgar’s V successors tried to destroy testimonies of his conversion. Ancient history is very different from modern history remeber.

The sources always atribute the first evangelization to Abgar V, although details of the event are often mixed with legendary material, or as in a case of Doctrine ofd Addai confused with conversion of Abgar VIII.

Adiabene and Osroene (the capital of latter was Osroene) were two neighbouring kingdoms in Assyria on the Silk Road. In the 1st century trade with the East flourished, and was largely maintained by Jews, who also sometimes served as diplomatic couriers. One of them was Ananias (known also as Hannan in different version of Abgar legend). Ananias was messenger between King Abgar and Jesus. He became one of the first christians in Edessa, however at that time there was no such term as “christian”. Christianity was only a branch of Judaism. But Abgar was a gentile, and nevertheless Jesus sent a missionary to his kingdom! This was breakthrough, suggesting that uncircumcised gentiles can also worship God. This was absolute heresy for the Jews! Later, as reported in Acts, one Jewish merchant, known as Ananias baptised a fanatical pharisee Saul, student of Gamaliel, who couldn’t even imagine such violation of Jewish law. Saul became Paul, and became most vocal opponent of necessity of circumsition of the gentiles, we all know this from his letters. This eventually led to the Council of Jerusalem in 50 AD, which declared that the gentiles didn’t have to be circumcised. Who taught Paul this view? Who was his first master of Christianity? A certain disciple known as Ananias And a few years later, a certain Jewish merchant known as Ananias came to the kingdom of Adiabene, right next to Osroene, and converted its king to the “Jewish faith” (remember Christianity was considered a jewish sect at that time). And he said that he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did resolve to follow the Jewish law entirely, which worship of God was of a superior nature to circumcision, as related by Josephus. Unfortunately, another Jew from Galilee, whose name was Eleazar, came, and convinced Izates that circumsition was absolutely necessary for a Jew (compare with Paul’s complaints in Galatians). Thus Izates became a Jew, instead of Christian.

Either the cloth was the Shroud or it was some other cloth with an image. We would then have a plethora of cloths with images of Jesus, despite the Jewish aversion to images. The tale is set during Jesus’ own mortal life time, so it could not be the Shroud and Abgar V was a contemporary of Jesus. You will therefore have to believe in some multiplicity of cloths with images of Jesus. I should be reluctant to do so. Dave, have you forgotten Manoppello Image? An image of the face, that looks like a painting… but is not a painting. Compare with the account in Doctrine of Addai I said that the Mandylion never existed as only one, single object. It was an idea. Daveb of wellington nz : I take it that you have now read Markwardt’s 2008 paper. In that case we will have to agree to differ on the merits of Markwardt’s 2008 paper. I note that there is no record in the gospels of Jesus multiplying images of himself for general wholesale distribution. It is also unlikely that the Shroud would have been sent to Edessa, a then pagan city, so soon after the crucifixion, as there are several references to it being kept elsewhere, including being kept by Peter, or being given to Pilate’s wife, and also being kept in Syria. I read it, although briefly. An as I said, I consider that it was more likely, that Manoppello was the original Mandylion. The Shroud of Turin arrived in Edessa later, perhaps from Antioch or elsewhere. Markwardt may be right at this point. We talk about two different things here the conversion of Abgar V to early Christianity, and arrival of the Shroud to Edessa. Besides there were more than one linen. According to the latin verison of Life of Adam and Eve, Adam was buried with three shrouds, so it is entirely possible that more linens were used: See http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/pseudepigrapha/adamnev.htm XLVI 4: And the Lord said again to the angels Michael and Uriel: ‘Bring me three linen clothes of byssus and spread them out over Adam and other linen clothes over Abel his son and bury Adam and Abel his son.’ See also: Remi Van Haelst, THE SINDON MUNDA OF KORNELIMUNSTER, COMPIEGNE AND CAHORS http://resurrectionnowinc.blogspot.com/2011/01/shroud images throughout world.html daveb of wellington nz : I therefore find it more credible that the Shroud was hidden in Antioch, and with the impending destruction of the city by earthquake and by Chosros, that it may then have been taken to Edessa in the time of Abgar VIII, leading to creation of the legend. Alternatively, it may have arrived in Constantinople by some other different route entirely. As I said, it is possible. But remember, there were more cloths. The Abgar story may be entirely true, but not necessarily the Shroud must be the original Mandylion. Daveb of wellington nz : Finally if Edessa was evangelised in apostolic times it would have claimed for itself a status of being one of the primary patriarchates, which it did not, nor never did, despite it subsequently being a major centre of Christian scholarship.

Just like Markwardt does. But if you look closer at this novel… What I would like to show you it’s only a theory. Not proven facts! But IMHO such theory is quite likely, even if I can’t prove it. See Josephus’ Jewish Antiquites , Book XX, Chapters 3 4: Now, during the time Izates abode at Charax Spasini, a certain Jewish merchant, whose name was Ananias, got among the women that belonged to the king, and taught them to worship God according to the Jewish religion. He, moreover, by their means, became known to Izates, and persuaded him, in like manner, to embrace that religion; he also, at the earnest entreaty of Izates, accompanied him when he was sent for by his father to come to Adiabene; it also happened that Helena, about the same time, was instructed by a certain other Jew and went over to them. But when Izates had taken the kingdom, and was come to Adiabene, and there saw his brethren and other kinsmen in bonds, he was displeased at it; and as he thought it an instance of impiety either to slay or imprison them, but still thought it a hazardous thing for to let them have their liberty, with the remembrance of the injuries that had been offered them, he sent some of them and their children for hostages to Rome, to Claudius Caesar, and sent the others to Artabanus, the king of Parthia, with the like intentions. 4. And when he perceived that his mother was highly pleased with the Jewish customs, he made haste to change, and to embrace them entirely; and as he supposed that he could not he thoroughly a Jew unless he were circumcised, he was ready to have it done. But when his mother understood what he was about, she endeavored to hinder him from doing it, and said to him that this thing would bring him into danger; and that, as he was a king, he would thereby bring himself into great odium among his subjects, when they should understand that he was so fond of rites that were to them strange and foreign; and that they would never bear to be ruled over by a Jew. This it was that she said to him, and for the present persuaded him to forbear. And when he had related what she had said to Ananias, he confirmed what his mother had said; and when he had also threatened to leave him, unless he complied with him, he went away from him, and said that he was afraid lest such an action being once become public to all, he should himself be in danger of punishment for having been the occasion of it, and having been the king’s instructor in actions that were of ill reputation; and he said that he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did resolve to follow the Jewish law entirely, which worship of God was of a superior nature to circumcision. He added, that God would forgive him, though he did not perform the operation, while it was omitted out of necessity, and for fear of his subjects. So the king at that time complied with these persuasions of Ananias. But afterwards, as he had not quite left off his desire of doing this thing, a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar, and who was esteemed very skillful in the learning of his country, persuaded him to do the thing; for as he entered into his palace to salute him, and found him reading the law of Moses, he said to him, “Thou dost not consider, O king! that thou unjustly breakest the principal of those laws, and art injurious to God himself, [by omitting to be circumcised]; for thou oughtest not only to read them, but chiefly to practice what they enjoin thee. How long wilt thou continue uncircumcised? But if thou hast not yet read the law about circumcision, and dost not know how great impiety thou art guilty of by neglecting it, read it now.” When the king had heard what he said, he delayed the thing no longer, but retired to another room, and sent for a surgeon, and did what he was commanded to do. He then sent for his mother, and Ananias his tutor, and informed them that he had done the thing; upon which they were presently struck with astonishment and fear, and that to a great degree, lest the thing should be openly discovered and censured, and the king should hazard the loss of his kingdom, while his subjects would not bear to be governed by a man who was so zealous in another religion; and lest they should themselves run some hazard, because they would be supposed the occasion of his so doing. But it was God himself who hindered what they feared from taking effect; for he preserved both Izates himself and his sons when they fell into many dangers, and procured their deliverance when it seemed to be impossible, and demonstrated thereby that the fruit of piety does not perish as to those that have regard to him, and fix their faith upon him only. See Acts of the Apostles 9:10 19: In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!” “Yes, Lord,” he answered. 11 The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. 12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.” 13 “Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. 14 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.” 15 But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel. 16 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.” 17 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 18 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, 19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength. See Eusebius: 1. The divinity of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ being noised abroad among all men on account of his wonder working power, he attracted countless numbers from foreign countries lying far away from Judea, who had the hope of being cured of their diseases and of all kinds of sufferings. 2. For instance the King Abgarus, who ruled with great glory the nations beyond the Euphrates, being afflicted with a terrible disease which it was beyond the power of human skill to cure, when he heard of the name of Jesus, and of his miracles, which were attested by all with one accord sent a message to him by a courier and begged him to heal his disease. 3. But he did not at that time comply with his request; yet he deemed him worthy of a personal letter in which he said that he would send one of his disciples to cure his disease, and at the same time promised salvation to himself and all his house. 4. Not long afterward his promise was fulfilled. For after his resurrection from the dead and his ascent into heaven, Thomas, one of the twelve apostles, under divine impulse sent Thaddeus, who was also numbered among the seventy disciples of Christ, to Edessa, as a preacher and evangelist of the teaching of Christ. 5. And all that our Saviour had promised received through him its fulfillment. You have written evidence of these things taken from the archives of Edessa, which was at that time a royal city. For in the public registers there, which contain accounts of ancient times and the acts of Abgarus, these things have been found preserved down to the present time. But there is no better way than to hear the epistles themselves which we have taken from the archives and have literally translated from the Syriac language219 in the following manner. Copy of an epistle written by Abgarus the ruler to Jesus, and sent to him at Jerusalem by Ananias 6. “Abgarus, ruler of Edessa, to Jesus the excellent Saviour who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem, greeting. I have heard the reports of thee and of thy cures as performed by thee without medicines or herbs. For it is said that thou makest the blind to see and the lame to walk, that thou cleansest lepers and castest out impure spirits and demons, and that thou healest those afflicted with lingering disease, and raisest the dead. 7. And having heard all these things concerning thee, I have concluded that one of two things must be true: either thou art God, and having come down from heaven thou doest these things, or else thou, who doest these things, art the Son of God. 8. I have therefore written to thee to ask thee that thou wouldest take the trouble to come to me and heal the disease which I have. For I have heard that the Jews are murmuring against thee and are plotting to injure thee. But I have a very small yet noble city which is great enough for us both.” 101 The answer of Jesus to the ruler Abgarus by the courier Ananias. 9. “Blessed art thou who hast believed in me without having seen me. For it is written concerning me, that they who have seen me will not believe in me, and that they who have not seen me will believe and be saved. But in regard to what thou hast written me, that I should come to thee, it is necessary for me to fulfill all things here for which I have been sent, and after I have fulfilled them thus to be taken up again to him that sent me. But after I have been taken up I will send to thee one of my disciples, that he may heal thy disease and give life to thee and thine.” 10. To these epistles there was added the following account in the Syriac language. “After the ascension of Jesus, Judas, who was also called Thomas, sent to him Thaddeus, an apostle,one of the Seventy. When he was come he lodged with Tobias, the son of Tobias. When the report of him got abroad, it was told Abgarus that an apostle of Jesus was come, as he had written him. 11. Thaddeus began then in the power of God to heal every disease and infirmity, insomuch that all wondered. And when Abgarus heard of the great and wonderful things which he did and of the cures which he performed, he began to suspect that he was the one of whom Jesus had written him, saying, ‘After I have been taken up I will send to thee one of my disciples who will heal thee.’ 12. Therefore, summoning Tobias, with whom Thaddeus lodged, he said, I have heard that a certain man of power has come and is lodging in thy house. Bring him to me. And Tobias coming to Thaddeus said to him, The ruler Abgarus summoned me and told me to bring thee to him that thou mightest heal him. And Thaddeus said, I will go, for I have been sent to him with power. 13. Tobias therefore arose early on the following day, and taking Thaddeus came to Abgarus. And when he came, the nobles were present and stood about Abgarus. And immediately upon his entrance a great vision appeared to Abgarus in the countenance of the apostle Thaddeus. When Abgarus saw it he prostrated himself before Thaddeus, while all those who stood about were astonished; for they did not see the vision, which appeared to Abgarus alone. 14. He then asked Thaddeus if he were in truth a disciple of Jesus the Son of God, who had said to him, ‘I will send thee one of my disciples, who shall heal thee and give thee life.’ And Thaddeus said, Because thou hast mightily believed in him that sent me, therefore have I been sent unto thee. And still further, if thou believest in him, the petitions of thy heart shall be granted thee as thou believest. 15. And Abgarus said to him, So much have I believed in him that I wished to take an army and destroy those Jews who crucified him, had I not been deterred from it by reason of the dominion of the Romans. And Thaddeus said, Our Lord has fulfilled the will of his Father, and having fulfilled it has been taken up to his Father. And Abgarus said to him, I too have believed in him and in his Father. 16. And Thaddeus said to him, Therefore I place my hand upon thee in his name. And when he had done it, immediately Abgarus was cured of the disease and of the suffering which he had. 17. And Abgarus marvelled, that as he had heard concerning Jesus, so he had received in very deed through his disciple Thaddeus, who healed him without medicines and herbs, and not only him, but also Abdus227 the son of Abdus, who was afflicted with the gout; for he too came to him and fell at his feet, and having received a benediction by the imposition of his hands, he was healed. The same Thaddeus cured also many other inhabitants of the city, and did wonders and marvelous works, and preached 102the word of God. 18. And afterward Abgarus said, Thou, O Thaddeus, doest these things with the power of God, and we marvel. But, in addition to these things, I pray thee to inform me in regard to the coming of Jesus, how he was born; and in regard to his power, by what power he performed those deeds of which I have heard. 19. And Thaddeus said, Now indeed will I keep silence, since I have been sent to proclaim the word publicly. But tomorrow assemble for me all thy citizens, and I will preach in their presence and sow among them the word of God, concerning the coming of Jesus, how he was born; and concerning his mission, for what purpose he was sent by the Father; and concerning the power of his works, and the mysteries which he proclaimed in the world, and by what power he did these things; and concerning his new preaching, and his abasement and humiliation, and how he humbled himself, and died and debased his divinity and was crucified, and descended into Hades, and burst the bars which from eternity had not been broken, and raised the dead; for he descended alone, but rose with many, and thus ascended to his Father. 20. Abgarus therefore commanded the citizens to assemble early in the morning to hear the preaching of Thaddeus, and afterward he ordered gold and silver to be given him. But he refused to take it, saying, If we have forsaken that which was our own, how shall we take that which is another’s? These things were done in the three hundred and fortieth year.” I have inserted them here in their proper place, translated from the Syriac232 literally, and I hope to good purpose..","date":"2013-10-27","mins":"5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"id":"comment-48906","author":"o_k","post":"Daveb of wellington nz : However, in all cities that Paul ever visited, he always preached to the Jews in their local synagogues first. It seems that there had to be a Jewish presence in the city beforehand. Was there one such in Edessa? I’m not sure whether that is known or not, the local gods were Bel & Nebo. Yes, according to the Doctrine of Addai there was sizeable Jewish community in Edessa, which is nothing unusal. Here you have the text: http://www.apostle1.com/doctrine addai syriac orthodox1.htm But remeber, the mission in Edessa was a very special case. It was performed on personal invitation from King Abgar to Jesus himself! And is quite likely that Jesus requested disciples to send King Abgar the cloth that later would have been known as the Image of Edessa, whether it was the Shroud, or perhaps rather Manopello. Daveb of wellington nz Acts states that it was Ananias who baptized Paul, but under protest. Was it the same Ananias who instructed Izotes? We don’t know, but there was a very limited number of names in those days, and it may have been a different Ananias. As I said, I cannot prove that three Ananias were actually one and the same person. But their characteristics are very similar, so it is quite likely, and cannot be dismissed so easily, as the so called “scholars” say, because it runs contrary to their usual paradigms. Daveb of wellington nz There is no reference to baptism in the Izotes story; Izotes is to be accepted into the Jewish faith, and there is no mention of Jesus, even obliquely. Yes, but remember that Izates ultimately became a Jew, not Christian (or at least not Pauline Christian), and the account of Josephus comes from the second hand, and I bet it is selective. The only Jewish sect we know that abandoned circumsition was Christianity. That was so shocking for a Jew, more even than belief in Jesus, so that the story concntrated on this topic. This was the most crispy detail in that story. Daveb of wellington nz Now suppose that the Abgar legend was set down in the time of Abgar VIII. There are two 1st century local stories circulating about a messenger named Ananias, one about baptizing Paul, the other about converting a nearby king into the Jewish faith. Therefore in writing up a story about the conversion of Abgar V, the messenger will also be called Ananias, because that’s the sort of thing Ananias did and he’s a prime 1st century candidate for the role! So really I think we end up no wiser about the true situation at all. That’s what most scholars believe, but this version is not a bit better than mine. Actually, it runs contrary to the sources which all claim that it was Abgar V, not VIII who first introduced Christianity to Edessa. Assuming otherwise, would be assuming that the whole story of Abgar, Ananias, Thadeus Addai, Thomas Apostle, and so on was fabricated on purpose, but we have no evidence for such conspiracy. But of course most critical scholars of early Christianity have quite paranoid vision of it, so early Christans are considered fakers, fraudsters, who did nothing, but invented some pious fairy tales, fabricated evidence, forged their relics, faked their writings and so on. Christian = Liar in their minds. Daveb of wellington nz I think the point of all our discussion on this, concerns the timing of the arrival of a cloth with an image of Jesus on it, which became known as the Image of Edessa. We don’t know if that was the Shroud as Ian Wilson claims, or whether it was something else. See account about Edessa Image in Doctrine of Addai: When Hannan, the keeper of the archives, saw that Jesus spake thus to him, by virtue of being the king’s painter, he took and painted a likeness of Jesus with choice paints, and brought with him to Abgar the king, his master. And when Abgar the king saw the likeness, he received it with great joy, and placed it with great honour in one of his palatial houses. This description matches the Manoppello much better than the Shroud! daveb of wellington nz It is possible that Abgar V may have been baptised; if he was, Christianity in Edessa was nonetheless short lived. The story about Addai arriving in Abgar V’s court with such an image, does seem to be a subsequent attempt to explain the arrival of the image, with the purpose of enhancing the status of Edessa. Pope Gelasius in the 5th century considered it spurious, and a fiction. I think it more likely that such icons would have been secretly and carefully guarded by trusted members of the early Church, and that any taken to Edessa, would only be because their safety was now threatened and Edessa had in that time become the safest place to keep them. As I said, if Jesus had personally requested such transfer of the one of miraculous images of Himself (Manoppello or the Shroud), that explains everything. It is often raised that in the first versions of Abgar’s tale there are no mentions about the image. One however must remember that the image was lost at that time, and theological objections against the veneration of images. But see account of Eusebius, who was against images: Tobias therefore arose early on the following day, and taking Thaddeus came to Abgarus. And when he came, the nobles were present and stood about Abgarus. And immediately upon his entrance a great vision appeared to Abgarus in the countenance of the apostle Thaddeus. When Abgarus saw it he prostrated himself before Thaddeus, while all those who stood about were astonished; for they did not see the vision, which appeared to Abgarus alone. “A great vision” is most likely an allusion to the Image of Edessa, slightly censored by iconoclast Eusebius..","date":"2013-10-27","mins":"1:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"id":"comment-48929","author":"o_k","post":"Daveb of wellington nz : I feel inevitably drawn to the conclusion, that any such special images of Jesus, whether Shroud or Manopello, or anything such, would have been secretly kept by trusted members of the early Christian community, and not distributed elsewhere, regardless of whether the prospective recipient was a king or not. Actually most of the relics of the Christ (True Cross, Nails, Crown of Thorns, garments, Sudarium of Oviedo, Holy Spear and many more) were kept in Jerusalem or vicinity (we can trace their provenance back to there), and only in later centuries distributed elsewhere. But the Image of Edessa, whether it was Shroud or Turin, or Manoppello it could be sent to Abgar, if Jesus Himself instructed the Disciples to do so. God knows why, for what purpose, he keeps a safe hand over it. So I have no problem with accepting the core of the story at face value, despite many different variants of it. Besides Edessa had very close ties with Thomas Apostle, his relics were brought back there around 200 AD from India, until redistributed later. We don’t know many facts about early Christianity, and its vigour and potential still may surprise us. Daveb of wellington nz : I see the story as written to explain the eventual arrival of the image in Edessa, taken there because its safety had come under threat, and Edessa had now become the safest place to relocate it. Its arrival there had to be explained, but the explanation given I think cannot be accepted as factual. Actually, the early versions of Abgar legend concentrated more on alleged correspondence between Abgar and Jesus, (or on doctrinal and moral issues) and less on the Image.

Remember, the temr Christians was first created in Antioch around 40 AD, see Acts 11:26. The Council of Jerusalem took place around 50 AD.

Segal also claims it as spurious. They were Jerome (Comm. In Ezech. Ad 44, 29 30) and Augustine (Contra Faustum manich. 28,4; De consensu Evang. 1, 7, 11) who considered it spurious, on the basis that had there existed some writings of the Lord it would have been kept in the highest esteem by the Early Church. But it is flawed assertion, as not everything that Jesus or Apostles may have written must be considered biblical canon, for example tax returns and other every day documents. Later Decretum Gelasianum condemmed alleged correspondence between Abgar and Jesus as an apocrypha. Daveb of wellington nz : If you’re not already familiar with it, I suggest you check out Markwardt’s 2008 paper ref above. Markwardt makes the point that if Edessa was christianised in apostolic times, it would never have become subservient to the the Antioch church, which seems a valid point. His explanation of why the legend was made to refer to Abgar V, rather than to Abgar VIII, was a ruse to record an important religious event in Eessa’s history, while diverting political attention away from Abgar VIII becoming Christian. “Only the names were changed to protect the guilty.” Yes I am familiar, however I consider Markwardt’s theory based on nothing but pure speculations. But I am inclined to the theory that the Shroud arrived at Edessa later, possibly around 200 AD during the reing of Abgar VIII. As to Abgars V & VIII I have several volumes of biblical apocrypha, and I know how the legend evolved. It was always claimed that the first Christian ruler of edessa was Abgar V. So there was probably some historical core of the story. But the first Mandylion was more likely to be today’s Manoppello Image (later known as Image of Camuliana, described in Dan’s next post, and later as Veronica Veil), the Shroud become a Mandylion on a later stage. I think the Mandylion never existed as a single object it is more general term atributed to various images, painted and miraculous. So the theories that the Shroud was Mandylion, the Manopello was Mandylion, as well as Image of Genua, or that the Mandylion was sold to Louis IX, do not contradict each other actually. Daveb of wellington nz : It is also unlikely that a Christian missionary would seek to evangelize a king unless invited to do so. But according to the legend, he was invited to do so! It was nothing impossible that a pagan king heard from Jewish merchants about a miraculous healer, in the distant land of Palestine, and wanted to invite him to his kingdom. Moreover, it was very likely, especially in desperate Abgar’s situation. The critics are always narrow minded and can’t imagine such simple situation. Daveb of wellington nz : It seems that sons of Abgar V were pagan in any case, and any latent christianity in Edessa would soon be suppressed. I don’t think the charge of scholarly prejudice holds in this case. I find Markwardt’s case persuasive, exceedingly well referenced, and I suggest you check it out. As I said Markward’s paper is interesting, but has very weak fundamentals. Nevertheless, it is very likely that the ancient history of the Shroud was much more complex than any scholar has imagined. As to pagan reaction, remember suppresion of monotheism introduced during the reign of Pharaoh Echnaton, after his death.

John’s gospel does not mention what side the chest wound was inflicted, and the cloth itself would convey the impression that it was on the left. I wonder why the artists showed the correct location of the chest wound on the right, despite the reversal of the arm positions. Perhaps they were following the Easter hymn “I saw water flowing from the right side of the temple” which seems to be based on Ezekiel 47:1 describing the prophet’s vision of the heavenly temple, and applied it to Christ. Yes, you are right here. It seems odd that no artist seems to have picked up the logic that any burial shroud showing an image arising from some kind of bodily contact, would naturally mirror reverse the sides.

Centro Espanol de Sindonologia CES ) In this paper, the author talk specifically about the supposed 2 X 8 cubits evidence and conclude that we must be extremelly careful before taking such a supposition for granted because in ancient time, the cubit measurement unit was not standard everywhere and all the time. The author state: “The debate about ancient cubits is no easy matter: the length of common cubits varies between 44.5 and 45.7 cm and that of royal cubits between 50.3 and 52.4 cm; as for the “Syrian cubit”, more correctly called “Assyrian cubit”, its measure is uncertain as much, and it’s seem therefore UNWISE TO IDENTIFY IT AT ALL COST WITH A SUBMULTIPLE OF THE SHROUD’S DIMENSION.” Folks, I AGREE 100% with such a prudent conclusion. And I would add another important possibility to back up this conclusion: nobody can be certain if the actual dimensions of the Shroud were the same originally. On this subject, the simple presence of the side strip (which presence has never been fully explained beyond any doubts by textile experts) is enough to at the very least make us very cautious concerning the question of the Shroud’s original dimensions. Yes, there are some uncertainities, but regularity of Shroud dimenisons expressed in integers is striking! It suggests that the original TS dimensions hasn’t changed much through centuries. The units that were used to measure the size of the TS were either cubits circa 55 cm long, or ell measuring 110 cm, that is 2×55 cm. Or, according to Ada Grosii: Thus, the Shroud’s length would be 56 tefachim (436.8 cm) and its width 14 tefachim (13+1, that is 109.2 cm = 101.4 + 7.8 cm); on the other hand, always keeping in mind that these measurements are approximate, we could also evaluate the Shroud’s dimensions by the tefach sochek (9.33 cm), and we would obtain even more interesting numbers: 47 tefachim (438,52 cm) by 12 tefachim (11+1, i.e. 111.96 cm = 102.63 + 9.33 cm). 7 tefachim = 6 sochek =1 ammah (cubit). 7 *7.8 cm=54.6 cm =1 Assyrian cubit! 6*9.33 cm =55.98 cm. Thus the opinion of Grossi: This line of reasoning certainly suggests great caution: playing with numbers, any result can be achieved is unjustified, if we only keep some rules, only the results that Shroud dimensions allow can be obtained. One more quotation from Grossi: As far as the Hebrew cubit is concerned, it measures about 45.7 cm and corresponds to the ammah, the Biblical cubit; in addition, Jewish sources often mention the biblical and talmudic gomed, which, according to some, is actually shorter than the ammah; furthermore, in the Mishnah we can find two other cubits (M Kelim 17:9). Thus, we can say that Rabbinical knowledge basically deals with two cubits, the Mosaic cubit, 45.7 cm long, and a longer one, which varies between 56.018658 and 58.352 cm The information derived from TS dimensions, “accidently corresponding to the units of measure used in the ancient Middle East is not a final proof of its authenticity, but neither it is meaningless, as the sceptics try to convince us, and can be used as an argument for pro authenticity..","date":"2013-11-19","mins":"7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits"},{"id":"comment-52050","author":"o_k","post":"Anonymous : Is there other ancient cloths of the same dimensions as the Shroud that have been found or that have been preserved?

T3) The letter of Theodore Angelus to Innocent III (allegedly 1205), mentioning: “the most sacred of all, the linen in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before the resurrection […] in Athens.” Some (for example Nicolotti) maintain its 18th century forgery. The letter comes from Palermo, Sicily, almost 1000 miles away from Besancon. Https://shroudstory.wordpress.com/about/acheiropoietos jesus images in constantinople the documentary evidence/ (Document XV). The document was rediscovered in 1981, but is much older. It was once a part of so called Chartularium Culisanense codex from Palermo, a codex of document of Saint Sophia Order, associated with Sicilian de Angelis family. The Chartularium itself was lost during WWII, but there was a 18th century transcript of some documents (including the letter to Innocent III), testified in 1859 by Benedetto d’Acquisto, arcibishop of Montreal, and former abbot at Monte Casino, considered distinguished humanist. The document is spurious, and as a copy, it is likely interpolated. But that’s not so important, as the info it contains about sacred linen in Athens in 1205. This is consistent with Otto theory. Anyway, the mention of the linen in Athens (ruled by Otto at that time) is complementary to T1 and T2. Those are (although each spurious on its own) three seemingly independent witnesses about Otto possessing the Shroud.</B. Three testimonies are more than one and need serious consideration. Now you need to use those “unreliable” sources wisely. 1.) The MS826. You claim that the author made up fanciful stories about other historical facts. Ok. But he claimed that Otto, Duke of Athens once was in possesion of the Shroud. There are two possibilities: A1) He invented the whole story B1) He heard the story from some seemingly unreliable source (rumors), and tried to back it with some documents in a clumsy way. Then the questions arise: If A1, then where the stories about T2 and T3 originated? Question 1: Where and when the tradition of Ray Castle coffer originated? and Question 2: What are the links between obscure MS826, obscure coffer in Ray’s castle and the equally obscure letter of Theodore Angelus from Sicily? In short, there are two possible options: A) Either Othon did not have the Shroud, and then all T1, T2, and T3 are fakes. This is the case if the Shroud was still in Constantinople up to 1241, as Mario’s Sainte Chapelle theory assumes. B) Or he had the Shroud in possession. Then all T1, T2, and T3 essentially say the truth about that, even if they have several issues with other things. What if A)? This means that all (very obscure to general public, and at least T3 is distanced from the two others) T1, T2 and T3 must have been simultaneously faked in order to create false impression (about 200 years after alleged fabrication in case of T1 and T3 at least) that Othon once had the Shroud.

HISTORICAL FACT that the letters were the whole base of the Abgar legend and, only later on (possibly a few centuries later), the whole concept of an « image of Jesus not made by human hands » was ADDED to the original legend. There are no HISTORICAL FACTS per se, only facts that were described in historical sources. And we have no evidence that the concept of an « image of Jesus not made by human hands » was ADDED to the original legend. One can find good reasons why it is not mentioned in the earlier versions of the Abgar legend, further one can find in the text of Eusebius, an iconoclast, some probable allusions to the image. I think the most rational conclusion is to, at the very least, also seriously doubt the possibility that the Mandylion could have been the same cloth as the Turin Shroud. Obviously you have the right to do so, but your arguments are weak and I find rather quite demagogical. What has the issue of the authenticity of the text of the purported letters to the Mandylion? They are two separate issues. The letters exist in many versions I hardly believe any of them is the original one, if there had been any letters (the current text being faked, or at least interpolated does not imply there were no letters at all). One should remember that some of them (with exception of the Doctrine Addai) are translations from Syriac into Greek or Latin. We don’t know the language of the purported original, whether Syriac, as implied, or the Aramaic (they were quite similar). And so on. And I am quite certain that the mandylion brought to Contantinople in 944 was actually the Shroud of Turin.

And secondly that the letters contain similarilities to the Gospel of John. Yes, but as Hugh noticed, this is not evidence yet. But take a wide bunch of historians specialized in the first centuries of Christiandom (those from outside the pro Shroud world) and I can assure you that there would not be a lot to buy the idea that the Abgar legend (and the letters that were used to back it up at the same time it was created or a bit later) could, near or far, be rooted in real historic facts related to Jesus of Nazareth and King Abgar V of Edessa because it is a well accepted conclusion that the first Christian church in Edessa only appeared during the second century.

If you believe everything that the Church of those turbulent years of christianity said, then you’re more naive than I thought… Dave say: Does Anonymous then concede that the Mandylion was some such kind of miraculous image? And I answer: Of course not! I’m not a fool to believe everything the Church is saying as being automatically an absolute truth… I am a free minded Christian who has not put aside his own conscience along the way! I don’t even believe that Mary was a Virgin and there are a lot of other “truths” proclaimed by the Church I don’t believe… Now, concerning the “image not made by human hand” slogan, this was simply what the “orthodox” Church of Edessa wanted to make people believe to support his battle against the heretical groups of Christians that were present in the region of Edessa (namely the Monophysite and Nestorian Churches) Probably a Pantocrator like icon of the face of the living Christ… And what was the model for this Pantocrator Christ? I would say, with some prudence, the Shroud image but maybe just indirectly via a sketch or something similar… So, you see, in the end, the Mandylion is important because it is probably the copy of a copy of a copy of the face we see on the Shroud… I want to remind in what circumstances the Mandylion was brought from Edessa to Constantinople. In 942, John Kourkouas, a leading Byzantine general, on the order of usurper Romanos I Lekapenos, started his campaing in Northern Mesopatamia. The Arabs had never experienced such beating from the Romaioi! “At the head of an exceptionally large army, some 80,000 men according to Arab sources, he crossed from allied Taron into northern Mesopotamia. Mayyafiriqin, Amida, Nisibis, Dara—places where no Byzantine army had trod since the days of Heraclius 300 years earlier—were stormed and ravaged.” Ultimately he turned to his ultimate goal Edessa, the city of King Abgar, where legendary Mandylion was stored. And then, something unexpected happened. Kourkouas, who previously captured with ease so many cities, now on behalf of the Emperor gave to the Arabs, unexpected offer: * The Byzantines will withdraw from all the conquered territory. * They will give a gurantee that Edessa will not only be spared, but not attacked again. * They will pay a ransom of 12 000 pieces of silver. * And they will release 200 high positioned Muslim prisoners. On a single condition: GIVE US MANDYLION! Such was the price for such old piece of linen. For what cost the Byzantines wanted it? FOR ALL COST! Whatever the Mandylion was, it was definitely not an old, painted icon.

He does not mention the portrait, most likely because he is something of an iconoclast. Some corrections, Eusebius asserts that the correspondence between Jesus and Abgar is genuine. Only later it has been discounted by Jerome and Augustine, on the basis that no authentic writings of the Savior would have been preserved in the Apostolic Church.

Except that conclusions are different. Or simply because depicting gruesome details we see on the Shroud would have been seen as scandalous for the susceptibilities of the era in which the Mandylion and the Pantocrator icon were created… Dave, you remind me a great deal of Wilson in the sense that you seem to forget good and important parts of the historical context in which those images of Christ came to be known publicly, especially the fact that, in those days, depicting a bloody and suffering Christ was not at all part of the normal way to depict him and the fact that, in those days, around Edessa, there was a big battle that was raging between the Orthodox Church and some heretic movements like the Monophysites and the Nestorians… As far as I remember, this mimics exactly the Wilson’s reasoning behind Mandylion=Shroud hypothesis! Haven’t you noticed that? All those things could explain very well the making of a false relic like the Mandylion by the Orthodox Church of Edessa and can also explain very well why the Mandylion face was showing a living Christ without injuries or bloodstains. All those things could explain very well why Shroud was folded in Mandylion face only form, as suggested by Wilson. It is almost exactly the Wilson’s reasoning (except that motivations are slightly different) Also, concerning this last topic, you MUST also consider the FACT that all the versions of the Abgar legend up until the so called discovery of the Mandylion in Edessa (probably during the second half of the 6th century) ALWAYS located the action BEFORE the Passion of Christ! Again, it’s a big point you seem to forget in your analysis! In such a context of a miraculous image supposedly done by Christ before his Passion, don’t you think it is normal that the forger was not inclined to had bruises and bloodstains on his painted image of Christ, even though it is possible that he based is work on the Shroud image? I really think so! In that context, every time, I will expect to see an image of the living Christ with his eyes wide open and that’s exactly what we could see on the Pantocrator icon and on all the Mandylion depictions. Just want to remind, that all representations of the Veronica Veil, before 1600s, showed an image of the living Christ with his eyes wide open, no bruises and bloodstains and so on, except the legend which placed the creation of the relic during the Passion, on the road to Calvary. This has much in common with depictions of Mandylion and this is not incidental. Yannick, you still miss the point. Your problem is that you don’t ‘sense’ don’t ‘feel’ the story of Mandylion. To your satisfaction, I tell you that Wilson also probably missed the point (or maybe not, but rather delibaretely tried to dismiss it). There is one missing element, most people haven’t noticed. One missing piece of the puzzle but apparently found recently. I don’t want to say here what, I have already said it not once, and not twice. See my posts #37 and #52 for some indications. And on the end: Important note: the historical context I refer is the one that prevailed around the time the Pantocrator and the Mandylion came to be known (during the 6th century) and not the context surrounding the transfer of the relic from Edessa to Constantinople in 944… The Mandylion from the 6th century is apparently the same as transferred to Constantinople in 944..","date":"2014-01-12","mins":"8:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"},{"id":"comment-73251","author":"o_k","post":"Look at fact #9 in this very good paper: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/clc3a9ment questions about the mandylion hypothesis of wilson 2012 06 28.pdf First, this is, for me, one of the main historical fact that clearly indicate that the Shroud and the Mandylion were two separate objects and second, this is one important clue that tell us that, at the beginning of the 8th century, there were people Inside the Church who were aware of the presence of a relic known to be the Shroud of Christ. But, of course, the question that remains is: Was this shroud the same as the one in Turin? There is no way to be sure about that since Damascene did not describe it. Nevertheless, if we presume this was the same Shroud, we can think that around the time the Mandylion came to be known publicly (around the 6th Century), it is truly possible that the authentic Shroud of Christ was kept and well preserved by the Church elsewhere (probably around Jerusalem at that time, since we have no record of a shroud of Christ in Constantinople before the middle of the 11th Century). The testimony of Arculf (around 670) seem to confirm a bit more this possibility. And if this is true, then we must assume that this Shroud was not often exposed publicly to veneration because there is absolutely no record from that era which talks about a Shroud of Christ with a body image and bloodstains on it… Good, Yannick, you got it. The only one hypothesis that makes sense, outside Mandylion hypothesis, is that about the Arculfus Shroud.

And I see no slightest problem at all with that. How many times do I have to repeat, that the Shroud of Turin was not the only one burial cloth venerated at those times? In Constantinople there were at least three such burial cloths, one of them was the TS.

B) The Mandylion is not the TS, Arculfus’ Shroud is TS. C) Neither cloth is TS. Anyway, the testimony of Damascene does not solve here anything, and does not exclude the possibility of Mandylion being TS. And one more thing: The main point I try to make here is this: While Wilson and others pro shroudies think that the various changes that occurred over the centuries concerning the Abgar legend were due to a progressive understanding of the real nature of the Mandylion (which would have been the Shroud of Christ folded in 8), I propose that most of these changes (if not all) took place because of the evolution of the theological views and battles that were going on inside the Church and in particular, in the region of Edessa, and later on, after the Mandylion came in that city, in Constantinople. Fine. But do you really understand this? What “evolution of the theological views and battles that were going on inside the Church and in particular, in the region of Edessa” are you talking about? What the changes in the legends about the Mandylion have in common with them? That’s only empty talk, unless you give some convincing explantions: what and why. On my side, I see no relation whatsoever, and no way how theological disputes might have led to the evolution of the idea what was the Mandylion. The other way makes more sense, the better the true nature of the Mandylion was known the more changes in the legend. But that’s really complex matter, because I think the story of Mandylion might have been much more complex than anyone suggested especially if there is some missing link in the legend… If Wilson was correct and the various changes of the Abgar legend were due to a progressive understanding of the real nature of the Mandylion, then why in the world there is absolutely no version of the Abgar legend that clearly indicate that this cloth was a burial cloth and why there is absolutely no version of the Abgar legend that locate the miraculous imprint AFTER Jesus death on the cross? Due to various reasons. First because there were probably some people who were not interested in revealing the truth. You wrote that if we believe Wilson, no one was supposed to know that it was the real Shroud folded in 8 Here I disagree with Wilson. I think there are some indications that the true nature of the Mandylion was actually known to few better informed people. But they had some reasons to keep it secret, and maintain the mystery. Secondly, perhaps because of the some missing link, you still can not see like most people. The old versions of the legend were possibly closer to the truth than later… And why there is absolutely no depiction of the Mandylion that show bruises and bloodstains? Read once again “The Story of the Image of Edessa” written by Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (appendix C in Wilson’s 1978 book). If the understanding of the real nature of the relic would really have increase over the centuries, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that, at some point, the truth would have come out regarding the burial aspect of the relic! By whom? If you know the history of the Mandylion, it is clear that there was no chance for that… Since you can’t find anything clear about that anywhere (whether in art or in written sources), then we must conclude that the Mandylion was not showing any signs of the Passion of Christ and therefore was not the Shroud of Turin… To me, this is clear. And to me, exactly opposite is clear… Just from the same reasons. Yannick, don’t be naive, there was no one who could reveal the true nature of the Mandylion… unshadowing the Mystery….","date":"2014-01-15","mins":"6:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"},{"id":"comment-165163","author":"o_k","post":"I have seen the negative value of it, after I have read the book, have you David?.","date":"2014-10-24","mins":"9:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/the-guardian-notes-the-history-today-article-by-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"The Guardian Notes the History Today Article by Charles Freeman"}],"image":[{"id":"comment-129429","author":"o_k","post":"Why don’t you ask German Trappist nun and iconographer, Sister Blandina Paschalis Schloemer and German Art Historian Professor Heinrich Pfeiffer what they think of you opinion?

Or in other words: THERE IS NO ONE PERFECT SETTING of Image J values that can be used in every situation! All depends on the picture you use. Its greyscale limits, resolution, properties, etc. You need to adjust them every time to obtain good results and whatsmore not distorted results.

However, as you have no idea what image Colin was using, your very precise “16 pixel smoothing for 306×72 pixel image” is mere guesswork. This is not a guesswork! Those are exactly the parameters provided by Colin! I reconstructed Colin’s 3 D, and I know that he is doing things completely wrong. Actually not for the first time. As I observe this blog (and enter his own from time to time) I know that this a constant way he is doing this thing (and not only he). Most people playing Image J simply don’t understand what they are doing, and they set a high smoothing, which looks effective, but actually is deceiving! That’s why insist on using color map. I agree that this image may be an artifact of the software, especially as the painting seems to be completely flat and without shading. However, if I carry out exactly the same procedure with the Shroud (using the image at http://www.world mysteries.com/sar 2wiki5.jpg), with a screengrab of 1168 x 292 pixels, and exactly the same settings, I get a remarkably similar picture. Even with that picture, you cannot get much: It has 786×150 pixels, about twice as much as Collin’s. But still its minimum. Here you have 3 D with 16 pixel smoothing: As you can see, it’s useless. Here is with 2 pixel smooth: Now it’s much better. But the image is of course flat, I agree. That’s what one should have expected. The truth is that it would obviously be best if the Smoothing was zero, but the “noise” over the Shroud makes it almost unrecognisable in that case. No, Hugh, zero smoothing is almost NEVER best option. And actually, as the Shroud image is halftone, smoothing is necessary, otherwise had we got high enough resolution image, and no smoothing, we would see no 3 D effect at all. Exactly because the halftone effect in a strict sense the Shroud image is flat, or rather needle forest. What we should do is to use moderate smoothing to eliminate impurities, extreme pixels and so on. I think I must make at last this presentation about 3 D properties of the Shroud.

Obviously with modern software, some knowledge about the Shroud properties, and what one wants to obtain, making an artificial computer image of the face with 3 D rendering is easy but you have all those technical helps, that allows you to “cheat”. It is not that the Shroud has some miraculous property that allows only itself to be 3 D enhancable. No. Modern printed replicas of the Shroud also have this property inherited from the original (see below): It is possible in theory to obtain 3 D relief of face or body via ordinary painting, or photography. I never denied this. Yet in practice, it is extremely hard, so no satisfactory results have been obtain so far (the other thing is that there were no purpose for that). The problem gets more complicated if you want to obtain subtle, low contrast image with 3 D and negative properties. Simply as you have only your eyes at disposal (like medievals) this task is virtually beyond human capabilities. The problem only complicates further when you use some tricks, with making bas relief reflections, experimenting with scorches, acids or other chemicals (and so on), thus in fact introducing more parameters, which results in that the space for making errors is only increasing.

In short there are three classes of FLRW metrics (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93 Lema%C3%A Etre%E2%80%93 Robertson%E2%80%93 Walker metric#Hyperspherical coordinates ) 1) with k>0 (which can always be rescaled to k=+1), that is finite, closed Universe and Big Crunch 2) with k<0 (which can always be rescaled to k=+1), that is infinite, open Universe, no Big Crunch 3) with k=0 (EXACTLY ZERO) that is flat, infinite Universe, no Big Crunch. So far measurements indicate that k=0 with lower and lower margin of error. But unless k is EXACTLY zero, both 10 and 2) scenarios are possible. Had k=0 this would be extreme coincidence (with, as I said, exactly ZERO probability for random occurence) indicating that the Universe is tuned by some Higher Power, whatever defined (God, or some higher laws of physics, whatever you prefer). Planck, WMAP and other measurements can improve constraints on our cosmological parameters, assuming that our cosmology model is correct (so far it passes succesfully all the tests) but cannot assure us with 100% certainity that the predictions of those models are correct. Especially as there is possibility of some unknown physics, impossible to test experimentally on Earth, coming into action..","date":"2014-12-16","mins":"3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"id":"comment-176930","author":"o_k","post":"Colin: http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5062 http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5076 So far, Einstein and FLRW rules, several alternative theories lying down, Universe is accelerating and flat.

I will try to adress at least some of the issues raised. Sorry I have little time nowadays to adress all. Piero: Here a vague example of short bibliographic reference: “MTF resolution of images obtained without an acquisition system” by Giulio Fanti and Roberto Basso http://tinyurl.com/orgjg3x Thank you for the paper, and a careful orthographic check of my paper. A lot of good papers get lost nowadays in the flood. Hugh: 3) OK’s comparison between my examples of 3 D qualities and the Shroud is grotesquely unfair. In Part 2, Slide about 18, OK places the Shroud and five examples of photos of forward facing faces lit from in front in a single group, and by manipulating Image J to suit the Shroud image as best it can, shows that the others are not as satisfactory as the Shroud image in 3 D terms. This is disingenuous. Why manipulate all the images using the Shroud’s parameters? If you want, try yourself and show us results. I can assure they cannot produce 3 D images on the order of accuracy of the Shroud. 2) The ‘banding’ between the cheeks and the hair is largely a myth. OK claims that there are two bands of lighter warp threads on either side of the face, and removes them with some digital manipulation to achieve his wider and more ‘realistic’ image. I invite the reader to try to track these light warp bands upwards and downwards beyond the extent of the Shroud face. It can’t be done. The two light bands are not a feature of the cloth, but a part of the image, and should not be treated differently by darkening them up. The bandings on the Shroud are real and evident. See: or http://shroud2000.com/Image Gallery/Set2/027 27.jpg See also your own paper https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/banding.pdf The presence of lighter and darker bands is clearly visible on both Durante and Enrie, extending beyond image areas. Halftone: Of course the scanned image I used is not perfect, in that it is much overcontrasted. I put it here merely as demonstration. But has a very good spatial resolution, below single threads. Giorgio, that’s why I discourage using jpegs for comparisons (like the one you presented), as they filter out higher frequencies of the image for compression of the data. Thus micro details of the image (like individual threads color) are diluted. The max practical resolution of the Shroud image is about 0.3 mm the average Shroud thread diameter. This is the size of a single dot. As I demonstrated, it is easily possible to obtain realistic 3 D rendering out of dots image I used, with the use of blurring filters. Without this, you get only a “needle forest” of peaks roughly the same intensity in the place of dots. That’s the halftone. And whether the color intensity of individual fibers is the same everywhere, or varies by a few percent around the cloth, is a secondary issue.

Can you justify your view? imilarly, I do not say that there are no bands on the Shroud. There clearly are. What I do say is that these bands are not bands of differently coloured threads. They are made up of the different shadows of the two different directions of herring bone ribs, of clusters of threads of different thicknesses, particularly at the spines of the herringbone. They do not indicate that the cloth is differently coloured, so that some sort of correction factor needs to be applied to make the image more accurate. Whatever those bands are, they clearly affect our perception of the Shroud image. In case of the face, if you remove effect of their modulation, you will get much more flat and broader representation of the face. This is what we should have expected from body cloth vs intensity relation regarding the sheet loosely wrapped around the face scenario. With bandings modulation applied, the face looks much more face on photography like, with its illusion of shadowing to create a visually attractive portrait. As you can see from transmitted light photographs, for example, the darker and brighter vertical bands are positioned in exactly right places to make emphasis on protrude, extended nose (due to its higher intensity on negative images), attenuated sides of the cheeks, left hair more intense (forward) than right (to give a correct impression of right tilt of the face). This is very hardly a coincidence! Finally, regardless of any of the photos or reproduction styles used, the half tone hypothesis says that no image bearing fibre on the Shroud image is lighter or darker than any other image bearing fibre. This is demonstrably untrue, just by looking at them in Mark Evans’ micrographs. Can you post two most striking examples? It is very hard to determine whether all image fibres are indeed the same intensity. But this is not so crucial, as the visible structure of the Shroud body image is created at thread level, not fibre level, out of those halftone “dots”, in the places where threads form a herringbone weave.

No standards you can’t measure actual. I agree, we have no standards. It is because we do not compare actual photographs here, but digital reproductions of photographs, in various file formats and various, unknown parameters. That’s why it is hard to make definite conclusions here about actual parameter values. That’s why I wrote in Part 1, Slide 5: “Caveat: As the image from the cover is already set at max contrast, this is not a proof of the halftone effect of the body image it is merely a demonstration of this usually accepted property.” I would like to inform the you and the readers that the original file I have is over 1 gig raw RGB scanned. It would be good to share or at least present some of its fragments (perhaps high magnification) in other formats than jpegs. Offset prints have a high degree of acutance. I’m assuming the cover that OK used was printed at either 133 dpi or 175. That means there are either 175 or 133 halftone dots in a line per inch. By definition, an offset print at 133 or 175 dpi is far from high resolution. I think it is a little bit higher. But this is largely irrelevant. As the average Shroud thread diameter is about 0.3 mm or 0.01 inch, the max practical resolution of the Shroud image is about 100 dpi. And if photographs can reach further, this doesn’t matter actually. But in his defense, I believe OK is correct to state that the Shroud acts as a half tone. The results of the half tones do increase the image formation contrast and acutance. If the image mechanism produced a continuous tone, most of the body’s details would be lost. And that’s the main and most important conclusion regarding this particular issue, we both agree with. The body image acts as a half tone, which affects 3 D rendering.

The dot by dot body cloth distance correlation makes no sense, because it would create a “needle forest”. You need to get smooth image, by blurring or averaging several neighbouring dots to get some 3 D results. The whole correlation approach is actually flawed, due to several reasons. I briefly analysed them in Part 2 (see Slides 10ff.). The first reason is that merely calculating correlation coefficient is not everything to describe 3 D. And another reason is that its value can be biased, depending on the (non representative) selection of body points taken for account. One weakness of Jackson & Jumper paper is that they took into account only 13 points. While this is enough to show there is some correlation, it still should be treated as preliminary result. Following claims about precise maximum range, for example, should be treated as overstretching of the results, beyond their reliability. I would like the viewer first read this quick explanation how we perceive images compared to still images. This show us that while analysing Shroud images, we must eliminate influence of our subjective perception as much as possible. That’s why insist for example on using color scale (‘Thermal LUT’ mode) instead of merely rendering of the 3 D shape. The scale is much more objective, although does not guarantee absolute objectivity. And another thing we should remember the scale is relative, and not absolute. Uncalibrated. As I mentioned above, there is no max range reliably determined we can clearly throw out 3.7 cm from Jackson&Jumper based on simple and little accurate linear regression on small sample. To get a reliable value of max range we need to build a model of body shape, determine how the linen wrapped it, determine the body cloth distances, determine the relative intensity of corresponding areas (not merely points!), and compare the results. And go to the second and further iterations… Extremely laborous work. But to make things even more complex, there is more. The image is not merely a body cloth distance map. As I have shown, the intensities of several areas are modulated by bandings, and there are likely other effects at work. The body image of the Shroud is extremely,/B> sophisticated and complex. Not some kitchen science Joe Nickell, Luigi Garlaschelli or Colin Berry could make. Negative image composed of several halftone dots, amplitude modulated, with isotropic distribution, resulting in apparent 3 D effect corresponding to the body shape, with no contours and boundaries, composed of several bundles of surface colored outermost fibers on the surface threads. Add to this operating by bandings modulation, inherent to the cloth due to the diferently bleached yarn batches, for the purpose to give the body figure (and particularly face) a more visuallly attractive apparent look. Incredible mastery. The fact is that the Shroud body image fools our eyes. It was meant to do so. The body image shows us details (like nose swelling for example), that technically are not there. The Creator of the Shroud plays jokes with our perception. He wants us to perceive the image in appropriate way. He watches whether we resolve His riddles, for example about correct position of the Man’s of the Shroud hair. Whether we are smart enough to play His game. Diddly Squat: We quickly realize that the notion about some sort of body cloth distance is the epitome of begging the Circulus in Probando question, “it is so because I think it is so”. OMG we don’t know jack about 3 D and body cloth distance. Everything done in Padua and Colorado is based on this odd bit of imagination posing as science. But in the science 90 % of it is actually such a “Circulus in Probando” approach! And it’s no problem! Had you any experience in this field, you would know that! For example: why there is a periodic shift in radial velocity of a star? Because there is an extrasolar planet in orbit around it! Why there is extrasolar planet around some star? Because there is a periodic shift in radial velocity of that star!… https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler spectroscopy It is what we call a working hypothesis. We assume some explanation of a phenomena, and test its reliabilty, as well as explanatory power. We test also other, alternative hypotheses. If a working hypothesis works, we stick to it, otherwise we adopt some alternative explanation. In the case of the Shroud and 3 D effect, we suppose that there is a relation between image intensity and the distance between the cloth and supposed body wrapped within it. The data show that this is clearly a case, definitly there is such a relation. But I cannot in absolute manner prove that such relation hasn’t been faked and there has been no body wrapped within a sheet at all. Similalry, I cannot prove in absolute manner that such a periodic shift in a star’s radial velocity is due to the interaction between it and planet(s) orbiting it (and not due to some other effects). All I can do, is to test this hypothesis, and test alternative solutions to the problem.

(See my comment to John Green). A fanciful explanation is not better that ignorance. Babble. Charles: The most profound revolution In iconography in the later thirteenth / early fourteenth century was t He emergence of blood cults relating to the scourging and crucifixion. So it is not just the Crown of Thorns in place, but blood flowing down the hair, along the arms, and from the wounds and the scourging marks covering the whole body. All this has, of course, been well covered by scholars, Caroline Walker Bynum in her Wonderful Blood, James Marrow in his works on Passion iconography( where he dates the emergence of all over scourging to 1300) and Jeffrey Hamburger who is particularly interested in the emergence of these aspects in Southern Germany. The iconography of the Shroud, the all over scourging, the pattern of the blood flows, fits well into this change and so one can argue for the creation of the images on the Shroud then. Charles & David Mo: If you are so wise (but only in your own belief), than how do you explain following things (see my presentation: https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/crucifixes by century 1.pdf ) the reduction of number of nails presented in crucifixion portrayals, from 4 to 3? the fact that roughly 90 % portrayals of crucifixion with 3 nails (dominant since 14th century, but the change already begins in 12th !) shows right foot atop of the left, just like the positive image on the Shroud indicates?

If you had done the simple quest I have suggested you would had understand that the change from 4 nails to 3 is progressive. You will find no crucifixions with three nails in the early centuries of Christianity. Scarcely one in the 11th century. Some in the 12th century. Many in the last half of the 13th century. And then there are few crucifixions with 4 nails in the 14th century. Etc. And once again you have shown your lack of understanding of the topic. Yes, the first represenatation of Christ crucified with three nails appear in 11th 12th century, and their frequency arises through 13th century and become dominant in 14th century. The Shroud surfaces in Lirey ~ 1356, when 3 nails model is well established. But you have ignored one crucial thing, well known from the reconstructed history of the Shroud. During Crusade period, in 11th 12th century many noble Latin guests visited Imperial Court in Constantinople, and sometimes were even given privilage to see imperial collection of relics (check Daniel Scavone’s article http://shroudstory.wordpress.com/about/acheiropoietos jesus images in constantinople the documentary evidence/ ). At the same time first 3 nail portrayals start to pop up. As we are almost certain that the Shroud was in Constantinople at that time, this is probably the reason. The rumors about three nails used during crucifixion began to spread (even if their origin remained unknown), and the change occured. And BTW, you contradicts yourself in your statements 1. You cannot provide an “explanation” of all the particularities of the History. Chance or the limits of knowledge are important determinant in historical explanation. You are an ignorant in History if you don’t know this. 2. In absence of any explanation you cannot accept the first explanation that comes to your mind. Specially when we are spoken of particular in History. You are an ignorant in History if you don’t know this. And later you state: The change from four to three nails is evolutionarlly explained by the same rules than explain the change of vertical horizontal compositions of the Crucifixions to the sinuous forms. That is to say, from the Romanesque art to the Gothic. According to 2. You cannot accept this “explanation”. And according to your other words: And you are not even the slightest hint. Nations need strong evidences. And you have not even the slightest hint. And according to 1. You cannot explain every phenomenon of history.

The theory of the wide influence of the Shroud over the medieval Art has the same degree of certainty than the confusion between the Mandylion (or de Clari) and the Shroud. This is to say, nil, zero, null. Only in your closed mind. “By the way”, not, because the word “explanation” has a diverse sense in both cases I mentioned. 1. When a particular occurrence is a cause (or determinant condition) of another particular occurrence. This is the model of explanation in natural sciences. A determinate event a under determinate laws and circumstances determines the occurrence of b. 2. In History (of Art) a particular event is explained when it is coherent with a model or frame. In this case, other alternative were possible in the same circumstances. The model M (a style, for example) determines that a particular occurrence α is not compatible and tends to disappear. But M is compatible with a, b, or others. And so, the actual occurrence of a can be explained. All we can say in our issue is that the solution of the three nails was coherent with a change of composition typical of the pass from the Romanesque (tectonic) to the Gothic (a tectonic). The first was a solid composition based on predominance of vertical and horizontal lines, and the second with a sinuous composition. That’s why History of Art has actually little in common with “hard” science it has descriptive power only but not explanatory while the true hard science should not only describe phenomena but also explain it. What would be value of physics, chemistry, geography, astronomy, had it only described their relevant phenomena, and provided no explanation why they do happen? But it seems that most art historians.are simply learned to assign artworks to a few standard drawers, and they lack imagination or the ability to think outside the scheme. That’s why there is so little utility from History of Art in the Shroud studies the discipline has no suitable methods for this kind of task. Saying that event is “coherent” is actually meaningless it can be coherent with multiple models or frames, and thus giving us no unambiguous answer. Yes, three nails are coherent with a sinuous composition but that implies nothing. Correlation does not imply causation. And there is no reason why four nails wouldn’t have to be coherent with Gothic art. No Mo, you have provided no reliable reason for sudden revolution from 4 nails to 3 in the 12th 14th century and there certainly must have been some cause for this effect.

Unlikely. The correspondences are too strong to be results of independent processes. Hugh: I also mentioned in an earlier response to OK that I was not convinced by his explanation for the wrong foot being atop. The Shroud clearly shows a wound in the right side and a left foot atop. Artists could either follow this (assuming, as we do, that the Shroud was a mirror inversion), or reverse it (assuming that the Shroud was a straight painting), but in fact the crucifixions said to be derived from it show the wound in the right side but the right foot atop. Hugh, I adressed those issues on pg. 41 46 of my presentation. See in particular slide ‘How artists perceived the Shroud” on pg. 44. You have there famous della Rovere painting, and there is clear that he mixes left and right sides. The side wound on Jesus body is obviously on the right side (on the Shroud it seems to be on the left, but in reality is on the right) but the hands are crossed right over left, just like the positive image on the Shroud shows. The mistake you make is that contrary to what you imagine, people were not (and still often aren’t) quite as rational, as yourself or you want them to be. The lack of consequence in the portrayals was very common. Aside from della Rovere you can point as examples the transfers of the side wound on the depictions Shroud of Besancon from left to right and vice versa, or the Pray Codex: On the first illustration we see Jesus crucified in traditional Byzantine representation which would imply 4 nails: http://greatshroudofturinfaq.com/History/Greek Byzantine/Pray Codex/pray1.html Yet on another illustratrtion, on the beam of the cross hold by angel we see only three nails (and the side wound on right side): http://greatshroudofturinfaq.com/History/Greek Byzantine/Pray Codex/pray4.html I don’t accept that the Shroud was somehow hidden from the Byzantines but exposed to tourists from Europe, But although you cannot accept it, all seems that it was indeed like that the ordinary Byzantines had no access to the Shroud, except for a short and extraordinary period of 1203 1204. The existence of the image on the Christs’ burial shroud was Byzantine state secret. Just read Nicholas Mesarites and his vague and allusive statements in his 1201 homily. The paradox is that Westerners probably knew much more the existence of the Shroud than ordinary Byzantines. It is very wide topic why it was in that way, and we have no place here to discuss it in detail. But we will return to that in another thread, as we will be gradually gathering and explaining all the pertinent issues. Nor that the four nails of Helena had anything to do with it, as they were as well known to Western Christianity as to Eastern. No source give the precise number of nails recovered by Helena. Gregory of Tours claims four, but his number is merely a guess. As such, it makes more sense to claim that the Crown of Thorns (or the Shroud) were products of the artistic development But you have no reason for the sudden manifestation of that development except the arrival of the relics..","date":"2014-11-21","mins":"3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/16/a-scorch-is-a-scorch-of-course-of-course/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A scorch is a scorch, of course, of course,"},{"id":"comment-172510","author":"o_k","post":"Running out of arguments, David Mo? In your desperate attempt to search for fallacies in my reasoning, you have not noticeced that you are making several own. O.K. Is falling in a logical fallacy: “correlation proves causation, is a logical fallacy by which two events that occur together are claimed to have a cause and effect relationship. The fallacy is also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for “with this, therefore because of this”) and false cause.” (Princeton.edu) Yes, “correlation does not imply causation”, but on the other hand causation makes correlation. That means two correlated features may be cause related; correlation does not invalidate causation. The problem is to show reliable cause effect relation and in some cases it can be done, in others not. It can be reasonably postulated that the Shroud image caused appearance of three nails crucifixion portrayals, but on the other hand can you formulate any reasonable casual relationship between sinuous composition and three nails (or even common cause for the two)? I hadly believe, this seems to be only time coincidence. This fallacy is common to all the sindonists who claim to a causal relation from the Shroud to some artistic features when they observe a coincidence between both. Obviously, the Shroud is not the cause of the “dramatic” (¿?) change of the number of nails in the 14th century, that is the result of a previous evolution, as you have accurately pointed. Obviously you don’t understand what the cum hoc, ergo propter hoc is. It is fallacy only if you cannot provide reasonable hypothesis explaining relation between the two (substituting explanation with the relationship, that’s what YOU have actually done with sinuous composition and three nails), not that you postulate the relationship itself. Had it been so, then practising science would be virtually impossible. The second fallacy is the hyperdeterminism. They don’t conceive that we have not an answer to every problem. So, if they find no answer they invent imaginative solutions. Ray Rogers informed on this fallacy. But some sindonists only read or retain what interest them. Once again you don’t understand what you are writing. The fact that we cannot provide answer to every problem does not mean we cannot provide to this one particular problem. And we can, it is the influence of the Shroud. The reduction of nail number was certainly due to some reason. And the only reliable reason seems to be the Shroud’s influence. But that’s an unacceptable explanation for some obstinent Shroud sceptics who would resort to anything only to deny it. Even to their own misunderstanding of logic.

However, David Mo pointed out that these changes were already beginning in the 11th century, and you agreed, now suggesting that the “dramatic change” began then, when “noble Latin guests” visited the Imperial Court in Constantinople during the Crusades. The dramatic change now takes over 300 years, which weakens the force of the word “dramatic,” don’t you think? I assumed that everyone knows those basic elements of reconstructed Shroud history so I didn’t mentioned it directly in the paper. I though it was obvious. The word ‘dramatic’ is used here rather in the sense of ‘radical’ than indicating a pace, which was indeed slow in the 12th century, but in the 13th century, when Shroud was in Western hands, it increases, and by 14th there is a dominance of 3 nail model. The 1239 purchase of the Crown of Thorns did not inspire a dramatic change, it was in the middle of a very gradual change. You should separate the transition from 4 to 3 nails, and the Crown of Thorns those are two independent issues, although mechanism is very similar. And there is indeed a total radical change in the case of Crown (contrary to more gradual transition from 4 to 3 nails), before 13th century there are virtually no depictions with Crown, while by 14th there are no without. Western crucifix makers in 1150 knew more about the appearance of the Shroud than Byzantine crucifix makers. I do not claim that Western crucifix makers knew more about the appearance of the Shroud, than Byzantine, simply they heard unspecified rumors that Christ was crucified with three nails, while their Orthodox colleagues adhered stricter (and still do) to the conservative tradition. The access to the Shroud and the shape of Byzantine iconography was strictly controlled by Byzantine hierarchy, on the West there was more liberty. Most lists of Constantinople’s relics are of Western (or generally foreign) provenance. When I said that this was as well known to the West as to the East, you now say nobody knew how many nails were discovered after all No Hugh, I said: ‘No source give the precise number of nails recovered by Helena.Gregory of Tours claims four, but his number is merely a guess.’ There is a difference between ‘no source give the precise number’ and ‘no one knew’, Helena certainly knew how many nails she recovered.

I don’t think it is cloth to body distance, even approximately or inaccurately. I don’t think it is a painting or a photograph or a scorch o graph or anything like that. Cloth to body distance. The problem is, we don’t know how the image of the body was projected on the Shroud, that means what is relation between body points and cloth points There are four major hypotheses: 1. Vertical projection (as assumed by Jackson and Antonacci) 2. Projection perpendicular to the surface of the body 3. Projection perpendicular to the surface of the cloth 4. Projection at the lines of minimum distance between cloth and the body (supported by Mario Latendresse and I also consider it most likely) See my figure: Usually all 4 models create very similar results, so they are rarley discussed.

When references are made to the importance of cloth body distance, that involves a radiation model (yes?). So differences in image intensity that are supposed to represent differences in cloth body distance are assuming that Newton’s Inverse Square Law is operating (yes?). But all the radiation models I have seen that lack imaging lenses etc have to assume collimated (“unspread out”) radiation. But why would that obey Newton’s Inverse Square Law? No, the Newton’s Inverse Square Law plays no vital role here. Jackson assumes that there is some opaque medium (like air in case of the UV), some “cloud” that is responsible for intensity distance correlation, according to the law: I=I(0)*exp[ tau] , where tau is optical depth of the medium. Colinsberry : So there has to be some other reason for the fading of image intensity that is unrelated to radiation (yes?). That means other mechanisms of image imprinting have to be considered (yes?). Reminder: there are three chief mechanisms for transfer of thermal energy between two bodies – assuming it is thermal energy that has produced the tan coloured dehydration products of linen carbohydrates – namely radiation, conduction and convection. Raymond Rogers had no time for radiation models. Nor do I. So forgive me if I switch off when folk refer blithely to cloth body distances. That is not dispassionate objective science. It is (more often than not) agenda driven, subjective “science”… I believe that the Shroud image has to be examined as a product of conduction (primarily) and convection effects, involving very close contact between subject and cloth. Conduction requires zero distance of separation, but convection probably allows a little more, maybe a few mm, possibly a cm or two at most. But conduction and convection are accommodated better in models that assume the correctness of the radiocarbon dating… In case of the Shroud only conduction plays a vital role, radiation and convection are usually negligible. Conduction requires direct contact, while on the Shroud there are areas which were not in direct contact with the body. That’s one of the reasons why schorch hypotheses makes no sense, because it is binary, either there is a contact or no. So 3 D always fails, even despite the image looks like 3 D.

However, Petrus Soons argues that besides those, the Shroud has additional holographic properties, which is another distinct way of encoding 3 D. Information.

If a front lighted facial portrait is taken in a chamber where a uniformly distributed, moderately dense grey or black “fog” is present, less light will reach the receding portions of the face due to absorption of the light by the fog. Furthermore, of the light that does reach the more distant parts of the subject, more of the reflected light necessary to make the photograph will be absorbed on the way back to the camera, increasing the distance dependent contrast even more. Yes, in theory it is possible. Anyway VP8 was designed to process photography. But there are two major problem. First: the lighting must be full face, and stable which is hard to obtain (even Secondo Pia had problems with lighting back in 1898, not to say about medieval). The second problem is that the intensity is not correlated to the plane in infinity (what to the high degree can be assumed in case of planetary images taken by space probes) but to the distance between body and the cloth, circa 0 4 cm, so some 3 D distortions will appear (for example cheeks are higher than the space between them and the nose). So one must simulate this. Is it possible to do so? In theory yes. One must create a bubble from transparent glass or plastic, with specifically designed shape that represents the shape of the cloth wrapping up the body. And then fill it up with some opaque liquid. Creating such bubble is extremely complex task even in the era of computers and robots!

How is it possible to create such an unusual image not denying the statistical laws of thermodynamics? Rogers concluded that there is no point in considering this problem, just happened to such an incredible event and we can only investigate a posteriori how it naturally happened (this does not mean that the theory of Rogers denies the resurrection, just does not take it into account). Maybe so, maybe there was such quite unbelievable event in theory it is not impossible. Only so improbable, that sooner I would expect that the outdoor Olympic swimming pool to freeze by itself in the summer heat (which is also theoretically possible) … and why it happened jus tonly in the case of the individual who had suffered exactly the same passion as Passion of Jesus of Nazareth described in the Gospel with whom perhaps he can be identified … unless Someone guided by the invisible hand the track of each molecule of ammonia … Resurrection of Jesus and the cration of the image could take place even without the flash … but also in a miraculous way!.","date":"2013-08-31","mins":"7:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/30/of-inexplicable-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of inexplicable explanations"},{"id":"comment-42515","author":"o_k","post":"But the place of burial is maybe 20 30 metres from it..","date":"2013-08-31","mins":"3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/30/of-inexplicable-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of inexplicable explanations"},{"id":"comment-42481","author":"o_k","post":"Dave: An extract from my article written in polish: “Ale wizerunek jest.

Don’t be naive, gabriel… http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n74part4.pdf This summer I was working on a new Shroud documentary, filming in France aqnd Italy. The main topic of the film is the supposed inscriptions on the cloth – anyone who has read my articles in the BSTS and http://www.shroud.com concerning this aspect of Shroud studies will know my opinion thereof very well. In my opinion, they are just a figment of the imagination, from looking at the 1931 Enrie photographs of the Shroud, which were lit by raking light and therefore show up all the creases and imperfections in the cloth, giving rise to all kinds of objects that can be “seen” on the linen. […] The example at hand concerns the “inscriptions”. A garbled mess of pseudo Latin, pseudo Greek and pseudo Aramaic using theological ideas and titles that were coined later than the death of Christ, but claimed by some to be proof of the Shroud’s authenticity. Professor Garlaschelli did an excellent job with a practical demonstration of how unlikely (if not impossible) it is for the random letters some can see to have been imprinted onto the Shroud in the way they are “seen” In other words p&**s them off. I got engaged in the “inscriptions” issue, only because producers paid me money for that… Aside from the (very complex) issue whether there are any actual inscriptions or not.

If there is no variation of the distance to the cloth, there is no variation in intensity, and the image is blurred, generally speaking. Maximum resolution? There is no one single answer on that.

However in view of the verses in John 19:25 30, it would seem unlikely to have been in place before death. Immediately before his death, He speaks to his mother and to John, and is offered vinegar. A more likely explanation seemed to me that it served to conceal the death rictus from passers by during the portage to the tomb.

It’s not positive to negative at all. His imprinting of the prominences of a real human being via powder frottage etc creates a negative immediately, because the parts that are brightest in a photograph (nose, brow ridge etc) are imprinted most heavily, and thus tone reversed on the imprint. If the attached pigment were chemically to etch the linen (“acid impurities etc”) and s subsequently drop off with ageing, wear and tear etc, one still has the same tone reversed, i.e. Negative image Yes, Colin, you are right about Garlaschelli.

The image is much more visible, the pigment is still there and there are no water stains and burn marks”. LG found that the only way to obtain a “fuzzy image” more or less similar to the TS image was to use a dry powder rather than a liquid: “it is nearly impossible, when “painting”with slurry, to obtain the soft tones and the shading effect which are generated almost automatically when rubbing with a dry powder. Also, it is very difficult to spread a thin, even layer of slurry over large areas like the chest”. Following LG complete hypothesis, the TS man was actually “painted” using this way (the only mean to obtain a rather fuzzy image like that of the TS). Because, according to LG, natural red ochre is necessarily contaminated by traces of acidic materials (like humic acids, organic impurities, various salts…), this foreign “reacting” material might be responsible for the degradation of cellulose. Meanwhile the pigment itself fell down with time. In order to test this hypothesis, LG had to find some kind of solid non neutral “sensitizer” which, once rubbed onto the cloth and artificially aged, could slightly discolor the cellulose. After testing dozen of salts and solid acids, either mixed with a pigment or even pure, “none of them “left any trace on the linen after heating and final washing. (boldings mine O.K.)

Expert? Anything special? This is madness. Authenticity question aside, I would like to point one interesting observation. Here we have Wikipedia’s article ‘History of photography’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History of photography It goes as follows: The history of photography has roots in remote antiquity with the discovery of the principle of the camera obscura and the observation that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to light. As far as is known, nobody thought of bringing these two phenomena together to capture camera images in permanent form until around 1800, when Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably documented although unsuccessful attempt. In the mid 1820s, Nicéphore Niépce succeeded, but several days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results were very crude. Niépce’s associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop the daguerreotype process, the first publicly announced photographic process, which required only minutes of exposure in the camera and produced clear, finely detailed results. It was commercially introduced in 1839, a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography.[1] We have also another Wikipedia article ‘Timeline of photography technology’: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline of photography technology * 1725 (circa) – Johann Heinrich Schulze makes fleeting “photographs” of words by using stencils, sunlight, and a bottled solution of chalk and silver nitrate, simply as an interesting way to demonstrate that the mixture inside the bottle darkens where it is exposed to light. * 1800 (circa) – Thomas Wedgwood conceives of making permanent pictures of camera images by using a durable surface coated with a light sensitive chemical. He succeeds only in producing silhouettes and other shadow images, and is unable to make them permanent. * 1816 – Nicéphore Niépce succeeds in making negative photographs of camera images on paper coated with silver chloride, but cannot adequately “fix” them to stop them from darkening all over when exposed to light for viewing. And so on. There is one crucial omission here: 30 (circa) 1350 (circa) The Shroud of Turin, the first photographic negative ever is created. Becuase, no matter the question authenticity, the Shroud of Turin is the first photography ever created, several centuries before Schulze, Wedgwood and Niépce. That’s a fact. And just due to its primacy, it deserves appropriate mention in the annals of photography but what’s strange it is completely absent there! Why? Isn’t it just because it is the Shroud of Turin?.","date":"2015-01-15","mins":"2:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/15/there-is-another-reason-charles-freeman-is-wrong/","cat":"image_theory","title":"There is another reason Charles Freeman is wrong"},{"id":"comment-183525","author":"o_k","post":"Yellowing of lignins is best achieved with sunlight containing wavelengths that are in the near uv, i.e. 360 390nm Bleaching of paper on the other hand is best done using daylight fluorescent lamps with ample wavelengths in the blue end of visible spectrum, i.e. 420 510nm. Why the difference? Uv light has energy sufficient to break chemical bonds that then initiates oxidation and yellowing reactions. Bleaching? Blue visible light, when absorbed by the yellowed lignin products, causes self sensitization with production of active singlet state oxygen, still molecular but a peculiar electronic configuration, different from ground state triplet oxygen. Singlet oxygen has a tendency to add across the conjugated double bond systems that are responsible for yellow colour causing bleaching. Don’t let anyone tell you that bleaching or yellowing of linen, paper etc is a simple predictable process, or that it would have been mastered by our medieval forbears.

And thus can I imagine that the shroud might be an “accidental” negative created from a positive painting, maybe even something from Constantinople? Chemistry? Theoretically, it is possible that the body image is in fact negative residual image of painted positive image, due to some chemical agent reacting with linen.

A quote from the latter (pg. 2252): Figure 12 17 show contrast enhanced artist attempts and VP 8 reliefs of experimental images. Generally, all images exhibit some correlation with facial relief, showing that an artist is capable of producing shaded images that contain some degree of distance correlation. However, all VP 8 images are different from each other, although they were all generated from the same facial shape. This implies that an artist, when viewed as an information transfer process (for distance), is to some extent stochastic in nature. This is in contrast to other mechanisms discussed below, which are capable of repeatabilty in producing shading structures. Figures 12 15 show the rigorous and freehand attempts of artists A and B. These images, when compared to the Shroud VP 8 reliefs, do not seem particularly convincing and in general have masklike quality. Each image posseses relief deformities, for example in the lip regions. The VP 8 reliefs of the rigorous compositions do not show significant improvement over the freehand versions, which suggests that the artist mechanism has a limit as to the precision by which distance information can be transferred. In Figs 16 and 17 the VP 8 reliefs are noticeably improved and in our opinion approach somewhat the quality of the Shroud image. However, these images are the result of the artist copying a distance encoded photograph with the contrast restrictions removed. Here you have 3 D enhancment of the video clip you posted.

However, in detail, it would be truer to think of four or five such spheres squashed together, a big one for the forehead, a small one between two slightly larger ones for the nose and cheeks, and another for the chin. Each sphere appears equally bright where its surface is tangential to the plane in front of the face, which is why in the shroud, and in many photographs, the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin all appear more or less equally bright, and more or less equally high on an Image J repesentation. The more angled the surface of the ‘sphere’, the sides of the nose say, or the slopes of the eye sockets, the more different they are in intensity from the ‘flat’ frontal surfaces, and the greater the appearance of distance. But remember also about: * shadowed areas on the face. * secondary reflections. * variations in albedo, even for statue painted white, that was used by Nicholas Allen. * light directionality and stability. In this way, by coincidence more than anything else, the distance/intensity colouration of the shroud image, which is probably real, resembles the distance/intensity colouration of a photograph. In case of the Shroud, the correlation is definetly not by coincidence. I’m not sure what the parameters of this observation are. Photos of people, as I have demonstrated on this blog, do show this correlation, Very poor correlation, compared to the Shroud. While the full moon appears quite flat. Is this due to our inability to resolve contrast at such high illumination, given that the background is so dark? I don’t know. No, it’s much complex matter. Generally we can adopt a simple model saying that reflected light splits into two components: * light reflected according to the law of reflection (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection) (specular reflection) * light scattered in all directions.(diffusion reflection) The overwhelming majority is the second component. Thus the surface of them moon seen at any angle is similar, but not identical. In fact, the luminosty of the full moon is more than twice half moon. The diffusion reflection mechanism is the way VP 8 works in case of the planets. But for our eyes, the relative differences in distance between each part (center or edges) of the moon are too small to see any effect. And the variations of albedo due to the moon’s topography (dark lunar maria, bright uplands) are differences of much larger magnitude..","date":"2013-11-29","mins":"4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?"},{"id":"comment-54376","author":"o_k","post":"BTW, Girorgio, I have sent via Dan my response to your e mail..","date":"2013-12-01","mins":"1:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?"},{"id":"comment-42931","author":"o_k","post":"Of course, the fact that some natural theory has gaps, doesn’t automatically “prove” the Resurrection, or any theories assuming that the Image on the Shroud is a direct effect of it.

But he was not a physicist and was not really interested in the practical impossibility of obtaining such perfect macroscopic properties macroscopic of the image through a process of gaseus diffusion. How is it possible to create such an unusual image not denying the statistical laws of thermodynamics? Rogers concluded that there is no point in considering this problem, just happened to such an incredible event and we can only investigate a posteriori how it naturally happened (this does not mean that the theory of Rogers denies the resurrection, just does not take it into account).

Nor do I accept Chris B’s assertion that the dorsal head image is actually a water stain. This issue might be resolved by a VP8 3 D image of the dorsal head image, but I don’t recall ever seieing one.

Read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art forgery#Digital authentication Statistical analysis of digital images of paintings is a new method that that has recently been used to detect forgeries. Using a technique called wavelet decomposition, a picture is broken down into a collection of more basic images called sub bands. These sub bands are analyzed to determine textures, assigning a frequency to each sub band. The broad strokes of a surface such as a blue sky would show up as mostly low frequency sub bands whereas the fine strokes in blades of grass would produce high frequency sub bands.[15] A group of thirteen drawings attributed to Pieter Brueghel the Elder was tested using the wavelet decomposition method. Five of the drawings were known to be imitations. The analysis was able to correctly identify the five forged paintings. The method was also used on the painting Virgin and Child with Saints, created in the studios of Pietro Perugino. Historians have long suspected that Perugino painted only a portion of the work. The wavelet decomposition method indicated that at least four different artists had worked on the painting Wavelet analysis is similar technique to Fourier analysis, in fact it is a kind of generalization of it.

And of course you don’t understand what those paragraphs are about. The papers presented discuss the issue of distinguishing between the original paintings and the copies of them, using as one of the tools Fourier or wavelet analysis of image areas in search for brush strokes (best visible in infrared but that does not mean that they cannot be seen in visual light) and then via some statistical analysis of frequencies (characteristic for some individual artist) determination whether the painting came from the same or different hands. They don’t deny that brush strokes leave some directional information in Fourier domain, only that such analysis is not always enough to determine whether painting is an original or a copy.

Take care especially about his hands moving. (16:59 onwards) Garlaschelli uses different technique than what I understand by the term ‘vertical dabbing’. My understanding is making small spots by multiple single touch ups by small brush (or using pippette), to create an image. But Garlaschelli’s approach is entirely different. He uses large sponge , an inch or so in size, roughly the nose width, to rub a pigment down into cloth laying on bas relief. In strict technical sense it isn’t a ‘painting’ as he doesn’t use his hands to make a form of the image, instead he only reflects the shape of bas relief his hands are used only to apply pressure to the sponge. And as his sponge is large (a few cm^2, that is the size of area usually analysed via FFT), in theory there should be no directionality (but of course this method is hardly suitable to make fine detailed images). In theory, of course. But in practice he cannot hesitate from moving his hands.

She speculates (quite reasonably for me, but I don’t claim she must be right) that those letters were some form of ID card for a corpse, written on reused fragments of papyri, and reflected on the Shroud. Being so faint, currently they are observable only on close ups of negative image. Yannick Clément : This is not imagery techniques that could determine if there is something or not in these spots, it is a proper chemical analysis of some tiny samples of fibers taken in these areas (which could be, of course, backed up by a proper imagery analysis but only as a confirmation tool for the first set of analysis). Actually imagery techniques (that means photografy) had determined that the corpse of crucified man was wrapped in the Shroud. From 1898 to 1973 there was no access to the Shroud, no samples, no chemical analysis. Just the pictures to analyse. To determine whether or not there are letters, we don’t need chemical analysis. Just clear images to identify the letters without subjective interpretation and argues whether one sees the things or not. Determining their nature (how they were formed) is the other thing, of course.

Marion writes in his book (co authored with Courage), that they had only images of the front face of the Man of the Shroud. 2. They were asked to verify previous claims of Marastoni, Ugolotti and others, about inscriptions around the face. 3. They used certain criteria to eliminate pareidolia effects. For example, the letters must have been at least 1 cm large (which eliminated alleged Hebrew letters, and coin inscriptions, which are smaller), they must be present in groups of at least two, similar size, similar intervals between them, positioned in straight lines, and so on. So the probability that they are photographic artifacts, wevae imperfections or similar effects is small. 4. Marion and Courage devoted more than 20 pages for descriptions of technicalities and their methods of numerical processing. In the article, adressed to his colleagues , Marion didn’t have to explain in detail his methods, just the results. 5. Barbara Frale claims that the inscriptions were written on strips of papyri, sticked to the head with primitive glue, made from flour and water What I would like is if someone tries to reproduce Marion’s results, using much better computer devices and software, and utilizing Haltadefinizione images. To confirm, or disprove previous claims. To show whether there are those letters and/or coins, flowers etc. (so everyone can “see” them, just like they see the body image, and not just “think they see”) , or to prove that they are just pareidollia. That’s all. It doesn’t need chemical analysis to do so. One doesn’t have to wait 20, or 50 years, until they allow to re examin the Shroud to check whether there is an ink or not, in the places where purported letters are expected to be.

I do not think it was close to zero, say, below 10^ 6. For example, DNA matching, it has to be very close to zero, such as 10^ 20, to be considered non accidental. There is a clear model to evaluate these probabilities (it has a simple model that works very well). This is what the probability has to be to be considered a non accidental image: pretty close to zero. You need a model to come to such an evaluation. We have no such model and it does not look simple to create such a model. Yes, but even if you have a model, you need some criteria. How low probability that those images are created randomly do you accept? 10^ 6, 10^ 10? Or lower? It is hard to say how much improbable must be the results, to exclude the possibility of pareidolia. Going into absurd, one may say that the whole body image on the Shroud may be pareidolia. Optical illusion. If one sees the clear structure of letters, say “OF NAZARETH” or “SHROUD”, does he/she have to calculate the probability that the inscription he/she sees has formed in result of random process? And check whether it is below stated significance level? Not everything may be calculated. The main question is: could someone re verify Marion, Filas and others results using the latest HD images, and modern hardware, software and more advanced methods? To check whether those old claims may be refuted, or are still valid, or even increase the chances of them to be actual objects..","date":"2013-04-17","mins":"2:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/14/the-making-of-the-hd-image-for-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Making of the HD Image for the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-30850","author":"o_k","post":"Mario Latendresse : 2) The Shroud 2.0 app image resolution does not offer that high resolution of 20 µm per pixel, it offers a lower one.

Much more important is what the Charlemagne’s collection of burial cloths actually were, and where they came from. ““Just I am not convinced about Sindon Munda and Shroud of Compiegne were two halves of the same cloth.” On which historical and factual ground? ” Gorny&Rosikon (pg. 298) write that Sindon Munda (stored in Kornilmünster) allegedly was to be used to transfer the body from the cross to the tomb. Beside its size is 180×105 cm, while the Compiegne shroud was, according to Hesemann 237×125 cm (other sources claim it to be 245 cm long), so the widths don’t fit, (unless data for Compiegne are wrong). “4/How long will you ignore the veil mesasuring 3,50x6m, proceeding from Antiocha in Syria is made of byssum fabric, is 16 TIMES FOLDED UP ONTO ITSELF and preserved in a gauze like protective fabric and tghus reduced to the size of a napkin? ” Max, do you have any sources for that? Gorny&Rosikon mention only that it measures 39×22 cm. Pierluigi Baima Bollone in his “Sindone, 101 domande e risposte” claims its original size was 615×352 cm, but today it measures only 39×22 cm, so I assumed it was either cut from the larger cloth, or its measures are wrong. And I think using 6×3.5 m cloth during burial is quite impracical. Max do you have primary documents for Charlemagne’s relics? Becuase I am not sure how much reliable the original tradition about them is. Due to complicated political relations around 800 AD Charlemagne could obtain his collection of relics from Jerusalem, as well as from Constantinople, and some perhaps via Rome. Charlemagne possesed several relics, or rather “representative relics” or “brandea” (that means copies): 1). Shroud of Compiegne, currently destroyed 2). Sindon Munda, currently stored in Kornelimünster 3). Sudarium Domini, currently stored in Kornelimünster 4). Linteum Domini, the towel used to dry the Apostles’ feet, currently stored in Kornelimünster. What’s interesting, another towel was among the Constantinople’s relics sent by Latin Emperor Baldwin II to king Louis IX, see https://shroudstory.com/page/5/ So the other cloths were probably copies of those stored in Constantinople (or in Jerusalem, and later transferred to Constantinople).

Journalists, so they may be inaccurate (and sometimes they are). Max Patrick Hamon : O.K., “And I think using 6×3.5 m cloth during burial is quite impracical.” Oh really?

Have you never heard of what a sovev (Heb.) or soudara (Aram.) is? Yes, I know. The problem is that there was a dust layer at the backside of the TS, so it had been probably in contact with the surface of the tomb, which wouldn’t have been a case, had giant Sudarium Domini enveloped the whole TS. Max Patrick Hamon : Do you really think a 3.50x6m towel was really needed to dry the Apostles’ feet? Are you serious? I never claimed that. I was checking the Sudarium Domini dimensions if it was really folded 16 times in each direction. There are some strange things in Remi van Haelst’s article.

This stars may be assumed to be related with some ancient cult of a Divinity or the Sun veneration. Further a number of groups of FOUR white horses and twisted snakes. This representation points in the direction of the ancient cult of “Mithras, the snake killer”. This cult was, in the era of Christ, very popular among the Romans military, in Minor Asia. Returning home, they took the cult with them.” Looking at the pictures of it (http://www.manoppello.eu/index.php?go=sudarium and in Gorny&Rosikon) I don’t see any such features. (about Sudarium Domini) “Today the immensly large SUDARIUM, folded 64 times, has the shape of a rectangle of about 80 x 45 cm.

Thus any picture will match as you have complete freedom in adjusting the scale.

If it was made in 19th century that amount is 65 %. I calculated it personally, besides it is very easy to calculate and every high school graduate who had advanced program of mathematics could easily calculate that. However it is possible that invisible mending to exchange about 75 % of sample mass: all wefts and perhaps a few warps (wefts are ususally thicker than warps).

Not they are not worthy of deeper study and historical appreciation — but they simply do not spark the imagination like the Shroud does. Your call for more patience, however, is well taken. When the time is right, when the technology is ready, when the Church is in the mood — the science will get done. They do not carry the same mystery?

What’s more the crystals of urea attached to blood cells were found on the Tunic, indicating that it’s owner, sweated with blood, just like described in Luke!

The other relics contain many complemtary information, which may be great help in Shroud research! Sadly they are still not appreciated in the Shroud world.

All the suggested radiation directions and cloth configurations are attempts to show how “anatomical perfection” would look when it appeared on a cloth. The trouble is, as I said before, that each of these possibilites has its adherents, all of whom think that the others’ versions are completely untenable, and would result in a distorted appearance. […] All of them begin with the assumption that the shroud image is not, in itself, anatomical perfection, but a projection thereof. Trouble is, none of them agree how to achieve it. And actually, that’s completetly normal situation in science! There are rarely single accepted theories usually there are many competing models competing models that try to explain more or less a given phenomenon, say the solid state physics, nuclear physics (there is no single good model of the atomic nucleus!), in astrophysics, and in many other branches of “exact”science, not to say about less exact (economy, sociology, history, archeology, psychology and so on). So such disagreements in case of the Shroud are something that should be expected. There is no final, widely accepted model yet, and the space of possible parameters is very large. But there are several good models, which explain various issues the problem is how to reconcile these models with each other. So some another manipulations with the parameters have to be undertaken, which is very tedious and difficult work (there is no simple indicator that would say we are going in a right direction). Remember, there are more than a dozen parameters! However, even exising models give slightly different, but still relatively satisfactory results. Actually there are probably no serious abnormalities in the image of TSM, at least no beyond some acceptable limits. Only some sceptics, like Nickell, Schafersman and their followers probably smoke some herb, so they see some terrible distortions.

See a picture of her, while she climbs up on the ladder to see live model posing: What does she see staying on the ladder, above the model? This: She sees her model not from the perspective of the Shroud wrapping the body (because it is hard to imagine such perspective, even for the alleged Shroud forger that’s another reason why his existence is doubtful), but from the perspective of someone who sees the body staying above it from the perspective of flat horizontal plate. And while she claims: “The professional arts cannot find any such discrepancies and distortions in the anatomy of the Shroud Man, which cannot be explained experimentally and which would prove it to be a painting.” she assumes that the image was projected on the Shroud exactly in this way, vertically on flat surface. Is it fully precise approach no. This is only the first approximation, but actually this first approximation is good! Some minor corrections may be applied, using more sophisticated tools (models how the Shroud wrapped the body presented by Jackson and others, some computer simulations like performed by Fanti and the one which is being made by Mario Latendresse), but general conclusion seems to be valid, there are no great abnormalities visible in the TS Man..","date":"2013-11-27","mins":"5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"id":"comment-56933","author":"o_k","post":"For the Holy Nails and their comparison with the one that was found in Jehohanan’s ossuary, see Witnesses of Mystery, Chapter 3.

They end in 62 AD in Rome, and don’t mention death of Paul, which occurred in 64 or 67 AD. So they can be very easily dated to 62 63 AD (had they not been part of the Bible no scholar would ever doubt this dating). Because Acts were preceded by Gospel of Luke, written rather short period before, the Luke can be dated to around 60 AD. The final (Greek) version of Matthew can be dated to about the same time, because most of the critics consider Luke and Matthew being written parallely. Now Mark. As it seems that both Luke and Matthew depend on Mark, it must be earlier, perhaps around 50 AD. Now finally John. He knows earlier Gospels, and mentions Peter death, but doesn’t mention destruction of the Jerusalem. So he wrote his Gospel perhaps around 70 AD, but the date could as well be later. Now how those dates had been screwed by the modern critics. First response to what you wrote about Papias: “reading from Papias that Mark was Peter’s amanuensis and wrote as he remembered, then if Papias can be relied on, it might be inferred that Mark wrote after 65 AD”. Papias NEVER claimed that Mark wrote after Peter’s death. Next: destruction of the Temple. You wrote: “However some exegetes read into Mark 13 that the temple is still standing, whereas in Matthew and Luke this is no longer the case.” This is the main argument of those who claim that the Gospels cannot be dated before 70 AD. However it is based on COMPLETELY FALSE presumption, and has a hidden statement of non believe in Jesus’ meesianic claims. The very ambiguous prophecy of destruction of the Temple is in Mark 13, Matthew 21, and Luke 21. According to the critics, it was put in the Jesus’ mouth to make him a prophet. Thus they suggest, that Jesus COULDN’T be a prohpet, and couldn’t predict it. But if you are a Christian and believe that Jesus WAS a Prophet and Messiah, this is obviously PURE ABSURD. Nonsense. And even if Jesus hadn’t been a prophet such prophecy claimed by him would have been nothing impossible. There are plenty of “prophets” today who herald the end of our civilization, the same was in Palestine of the 1st century, when apocalyptic and messianic expectations were very common (just to mention Essens). Many Jews considerd Temple as corrupt. The Temple was once destroyed, by Babyloninas in 586 BC, so why couldn’t this happen again. In political situation in Palestine, when uprising against the Romans could start every moment, the eventual destruction of the Temple was very easy to predict. And one final note: THERE IS NO PLACE IN THE GOSPELS WHICH CLAIM THAT THE PR Op HECY HAD FULFILLED..","date":"2013-09-21","mins":"5:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)"},{"id":"comment-44958","author":"o_k","post":"So once again: “I don’t buy it, arguments too flimsy, too much wishful thinking.” The same is even more true about approach of the modern critics dating the Gospels after 70 AD. They depend more on wishful thinking and absurd reasoning. If anyone was using the approach used to discredit biblical stories to any other classical literature (Tacitus, Herodotus, Thucydydes, Suetonius and so on) he would be considered a madman. Because biblical and classical studies are in fact two different worlds. And modern critics are not interested in searching for the truth but rather in gradual denial of Christianity. 1). Oral tradition. It was certainly there. It was also AFTER the Gospels were written. Several additional informations can be possibly found in the early Church Fathers Writings, as well as some Apocrypha. The unwritten Tradition is still important part of Catholic and Orthodox Christians. But this absolutely doesn’t exclude the possibility that Gospels were written before 70 AD. “The Parousia was soon expected and there would be little point in setting them down in writing until it became apparent that eye witnesses were dying out, and the Parousia was not as immediate as they had imagined.” This is another myth. Based on what on some remarks in the Paul’s letters (who wrote himself that the date of Parousia is uncertain) and on THE GOSPELS! Which, according to this version, shouldn’t be written because early Christians didn’t need them. Besides it is not certain that all early Christians would expect Parousia within their lifetime. Remember, the prophecies of Jesus were quite ambiguous, as all the prophecies have to be. Most commentators see the words of Jesus “Verily I say unto you, there are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” (Matthew 16:28) to the Transfiguration of Jesus. Read Benedict XVI “The Jesus of Nazareth” for example. 2).”The argument from Luke’s Acts, I believe will not stand up. There is too much discrepancy between Paul’s own teachings in his epistles and Luke’s interpretation, for Acts to be contemporaneous with Paul.” This is another nonsense. Remember, what we write about ourselves usually differs from that what others write about us. “There is no need for Acts to record the death of Paul, and this is a flimsy argument to assert that Acts predates it.” At the end of Acts, Paul is alive and well. Why? Why does Luke not mention at all his ultimate fate? There is no piece of evidence that he wanted to write the third volume, after Gospel and Acts, as some claim. 3).”If Papias has Mark as Peter’s amenuensis, why does he then say that Mark wrote as he remembered, but not in the right order, as if Peter was not then available to correct any errors that Papias believed Mark had got incorrect?” The chronological order is not important. Can you find A SINGLE hitorical or biographical book which maintains it through the whole text. And according to Christian tradition, Mark was later Bishop of Alexandria and died circa 68. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint Mark Some commentators place the Peter’s first visit to Rome around 45 50 AD. 4). As I said the argument from destruction of the Temple is simply absurd. 5).”I see the final redactors of the gospels, particlarly Matthew and Luke, not so much as original authors, but more as editors each with a specific purpose, who assembled a mix of oral traditions and written material, set their own particular viewpoint upon this material” And that’s right, because they certainly used some earlier material. Most probably, Matthew took some notes during the Jesus lifetime (Papias mentiones that), which formed the basis of later Gospels. Some traits of it perhaps can be found in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas (with several gnosticisms added later). Remember, Jeremiah had a secretary, Baruch. So why Matthew couldn’t be Jesus’ secretary? The Thiede writes about that in his “Jesus Papyrus”. Of course the modern criticism created another absurd viewpoint that Matthew was illiterate. Then later Mark wrote his Gospel, basing on Peter and Matthew’s notes. This served as a basis for Matthew to write a final form of his Gospel, and for the Luke. Remember, there was no copyright in the 1st century. “before the gospels attained their final form.” The textual variations in Gospels are very minor. This, and internal logic of the text suggest that they were written in a form very close to today’s relatively quickly. Their slow evolution is another myth of critics. Who it should be underlined are not interested in searching for “the truth”, but rather in practicing negationism..","date":"2013-09-21","mins":"7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)"},{"id":"comment-44964","author":"o_k","post":"Dave: Try to think about what I have written again and again.

I know it is hard to accept this now, just like it is initially hard for most people to accept that the Shroud is genuine, for example. It is not a mystery that biblical critics invent their theories not to seek the truth, but to destroy the credibility of Christianity. And later present those theories as “scientific” and “absolute” truth. And several other scholars, even the Catholic ones, fall into this trap, because they are afraid of being “non scientific”. This is herd instinct. The attitude of Biblical critics is typical, because being anti Christian is popular since the time of Enlightment circa 1700. Even Barrie Schwortz, a Jew, noticed that. You now how absurd theories of Nickell, Garlaschelli, Schafersmann and others about the Shroud are presented in popular media. The same is true about Biblical Scholars.

This is what you don’t understand, there are more subtleties here, and “normal analysis” fails. But first of all I must explain something. I don’t buy the whole Scavone’s story about fire, stealing the Shroud from Besancon cathedral, re appereance in Lirey, Jeanne de Vergy commisioning painter to make a copy, replacing one Shroud for another, etc. It makes no sense to me for various reasons. I am not even specially interested whethere there was some Shroud in Besancon before 1523. The only thing that interests me is whethere Othon de la Roche possesed for some time the Shroud sacked from Constantinople in 1204. Not SOME documents, but ONE document: this manuscript 826, of the 18th century. […] But the question, as I said, was just explained many years ago: the author of this treatise, in 18th century, said for the first time that Othon had a shroud (500 years later the 1204), when until that moment ALL historians in Besançon said that the Shroud arrived in Besançon some centuries before and by another way (all ignorant?). He quoted some sources, declaring that these sources attribute to Othon the translation of the Shroud. But it is not true, they did not. He manipulated them in a evident and also shameful. He is very ignorant, and for example says that a certain historian was at Constantinople on 1204, when the historian was born AFTER 1204. And so on. For that, Vignon and Zaccone (they are not “Skeptics”) understood that the manuscript 826 was written by someone who INVENTED the link between Othon and the Shroud, to defend his shroud (a normal painting). Now I have identified the author and the sources he manuipulated and falsificated, but, I repeat, it was enough what Vignon and Zaccone wrote to have a correct idea about the problem. You don’t get it. You missed basic thing, even if you identify author (by name), even if you identify sources he used (the question arises here: have you identified ALL sources he used?), it is still not enough. The author of MS826 confused historical facts, perhaps even manipulated sources I can agree with that. But it is irrelevant as it DOESN’T PROVE that he INVENTED the whole story about Othon. He perhaps luckily found good track, yet he was unable to present it in a convincing way, so he made mistakes or perhaps even tampered with the sources. Nevertheless this doesn’t mean that the information about Othon is INVALID. True informations may be present even in the most unreliable documents: forgeries, legends, apocrypha, romances, poems yet one must be skillful enough to extract them. Let me put it this way: The Theodore Angelus letter, the MS 826, the tradition of Ray sur Saône castle are very weak sources each on its own. Yet together although seemingly independent from each other they provide complementary informations, they back each other and make coherent whole. So either they reflect the true story that Othon once possesed some Shroud looted from Constantinople, or are parts of some really BIG conspiracy for some obscure and meaningless purpose in 18th 19th century..","date":"2014-12-02","mins":"1:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-174728","author":"o_k","post":"Aljone, I have to do a little correction: it is not true that STURP team did not want C14 testing.

Indeed the pace, when you were running away from discussion with me in this thread https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/28/dan scavone responds to charles freemans article/#comments was really impressive!

So the forger of the cartulary created a fake diploma of Constantine XI, with a false genealogy of his family; and then, to make believe that his family had in the past important relics, made a false dowry which contained the stones of the home of Our Lady of Loreto, a false report of translation of the relics of the martyrs of Otranto to naples and our false letter to the pope where is said that they possessed the Shroud. When the letter was forged, the forger was inspired by the histories of the Shroud of Turin written in his times, after Pingone [1581] that for the first time said that Marguerite de Charny was a GREEK noble woman; that, we know, was false, but repeated for a long time). The forger was not very able, and did not know the Greek; it is easy to see that the document is not authentic.

The large widespread of relics was due to the fact, they were usually split into more and more tiny fragmenst and distributed around the monarch and churches of the whole Christian world. Because the rule saying “even the tiniest fragment of the relic is equivalent to the whole”, there were often considered in documents as the whole relic, not just part. Thus the large wood of true crosses. Thus about 36 Holy Nails, while actually there were only 3 4 nails that pierced the body, and 6 7 nails used to join the beams of the cross and Titulus (that one is in Colle van d’Elsa in Tuscany). Most of those 36 nails are actually tiny fragments separated from the original Holy nails (which are, according to Hesemann, most likely in Rome’s Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and in Siena, and I suspect the third one is in Trier). Thus many original Crowns of Thorns, which were actually single thorns from it. And so on. Forgeries of course sometimes happened it would be strange if there had been none. But while studying catalogues of relics, I came to believe that actually most of the relics are authentic, at least in some sense sometimes they are original relics, sometimes tiny portions of them, sometimes simply copies that came in contact with original, and later, with the loss of documents, their true identity was simply forgotten.

Actually the whole discovery of the True Cross by Helena was possible only due to the unbroken tradition among Jerusalem community about the location of Golgotha and the Tomb, and memory that the Cross was buried somewhere there. The relics and sacred places were definetly venerated, even at distance.

The Martyrdom of Polycarp (died between 155 169 AD), Chapter 18 (http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0102.htm): The centurion then, seeing the strife excited by the Jews, placed the body in the midst of the fire, and consumed it. Accordingly, we afterwards took up his bones, as being more precious than the most exquisite jewels, and more purified than gold, and deposited them in a fitting place, whither, being gathered together, as opportunity is allowed us, with joy and rejoicing, the Lord shall grant us to celebrate the anniversary of his martyrdom, both in memory of those who have already finished their course, and for the exercising and preparation of those yet to walk in their steps. Origen, Contra Celsum 1:51 (http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04161.htm): With respect to the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, if any one desires, after the prophecy of Micah and after the history recorded in the Gospels by the disciples of Jesus, to have additional evidence from other sources, let him know that, in conformity with the narrative in the Gospel regarding His birth, there is shown at Bethlehem the cave where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And this sight is greatly talked of in surrounding places, even among the enemies of the faith, it being said that in this cave was born that Jesus who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians. So here we have the manger, that Hugh was interested in. And so on. The relics were venerated since the very begining of Christainity. Actually, they were venerated by judaism before Christ was even born: 2 Kings 18:4 (NIV) http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2 Kings%2018&version=NIV;KJV#fen NIV 10029b He [Hezekiah] broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan.) The point here is not that he destoyed a relic (it is nowhere stated that God ordered him to do so), but that the relic was preserved. And now the passage about the power of relics: 2 Kings 13:20 21 (NIV) http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2 Kings%2013&version=NIV;KJV Elisha died and was buried. Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring. 21 Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb.

The problem got much worse after the Fourth Crusade when unscrupulous operators took advantage of the flood of relics coming in from Constantinople to create their own. Pope Innocent III had to insist, in 1215, that bones be given proper reliquaries and it was often said you should not trust a relic as coming from Constantinople unless it had a reliquary with Greek writing on it. Pope Innocent also set up commissions to test whether a miracle was genuine or not – and these commission accounts can be fascinating reading with many miracles thrown out as unsupported by any evidence! That’s actually why we can trust that the relics venerated across Europe up to this day are duly certified contrary to what was illegally sold at some markets in medieval Europe, and is still today: Read this (with a little help of Google Translator): http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/pl.php/aktualnosci/malopolska/1270170 kup sobie relikwie sw piotra apostola.html still it is very likely that those frahments on sale were actually genuine.

Are you really suggesting that whenever anyone claims to have part of John the Baptist it is genuine? Charles, if you have better source, than present it to us. Actually, I used more sources, and I know about more relics of Saint John the Baptist, but the CNN’s list was the most convenient to use. I think we must agree to differ. I spent three years researching medieval relic cults and noted how they rose and fell, new relics turned up from nowhere, often without any provenance, there were battles between rival monasteries over who had the true body of so and so or the better phial of Christ’s blood and, with a thousand year gap between the time of Christ and the Middle Ages, virtually no relic had any evidence of its provenance anyway. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this. If you don’t want to believe in authenticity of any of them, you have a right to do so but please, stop spreading old Elizabethan era myths about Catholics and their relics. The exact provenance might have been lost in most cases, but not the most important info its ID, that this piece is a relic of this or that Saint. You do not seem to be aware of the serious theological objections to relics on the grounds that they encouraged the worship of objects at the expense of God. One of the greatest of the fourth century theologians , Basil of Caesarea, put it as follows: ‘ As the sun does not need the lamplight, so also the church of the congregation can do without the remains of the martyrs. It is sufficient to venerate the name of Christ, for the Church is his bride, redeemed by his blood.’ I am Catholic, and those Protestant objections are not of interest to me. I have nothing against Protestants, except that if someone has no tradition of its own, let he not try to destroy the traditions of others. I assume that you don’t live in Europe but if you are over here, do wander around the sacristies of some medieval Catholic churches – you will hardly believe that there were quite that many saints in existence as you will find parts of in the reliquaries and that is after the church cleaned out so many in the late nineteenth century. I live in Europe, and I know that relics were divided into almost infinite fragments. Remember pars pro toto, part for the whole. This was the reason of the great widespread of relics.

The same manger were Jesus was born, was probably still used to feed animals 40 years later, when Jesus was crucified and later raised from the dead.

The difficulty lies in tracking those few that have survived the long centuries into the medieval period and beyond. “The relics stored in today’s churches and palaces were checked about their provenance.” Really, how? The older the relic is purported to be, the less likely there is to be any provenance at all. A 19th century bishop’s seal is not, in any sense of the word, ‘provenance.’ “If a relic came from Rome, Jerusalem, Constantinople etc., that’s fine.” No, it’s not. There was, by the 19th century, absolutely no way of knowing where most Middle Eastern relics had come from except by tradition, and usually no evidence of the tradition more than a few centuries further, if that. You still don’t understand the rule? But this is so simple, and reminds well known model in statistical physics, known as Markov chain with a short memory. Suppose there is a relic X of a saint Y (from the very 1st century) in a town known as Godforgotwhere. The exact provenance of the relic X is unknown, except the citizens of Godforgotwhere remeber that they obtained the relic (with all certificates) from Paris. Those certificates from Paris however say nothing where the relic was obtained. However a few hundreds years before, they knew that the relic X from Paris came from Rome, based on further, now lost documents. Next, they in Rome knew that the relic X came from Constantinople, because they had appropriate documents. In Constantinople, they knew the relic X came from Antioch. In Antioch they knew the relic X came from Jerusalem. In Jerusalem they knew the origin of relic X, that it originated from saint Y. So: The trace of relic X Godforgotwhere <— Paris Paris <— Rome Rome <— Constantinople Constantinople <— Antioch Antioch <— Jerusalem Jerusalem <— Saint Y. Godforgotwhere <— Paris<— Rome<— Constantinople<— Antioch<— Jerusalem<— Saint Y. Now all the intermediate steps can be forgotten! The only important info: Relic X of Saint Y in a town of Godforgotwhere <— Saint Y. That's how it works in practice. Unless one link cheats the ID of the relic is well saved.

Those are the doubts most people have at the begining, but if one looks at it deeper, then he discovers that this was only his initial misconceptions. Why vastly improbable? Becuase we are used to the fact that most of the items belonging to us will not survive the trial of time? But actually this notion is flawed. In today’s modern world, few care about preserving their own items, they are considered worthless, and eventually end in a trash. And we think the same rule applies to the ancient relics of the Holy Men & Women who once walked on this Earth. But this is not true. The precious items which belonged to them, or their reamins, were considered the most precious treasures of their followers, and they were carefully maintained and handed through generations, with tradition (often only by word of mouth) what, and whose actually they were. Documents got burned, details became mixed and confused, legends originated but the most important information, whose this relic was, was still preserved, up to this day. Some relics (like the Shroud or Holy Tunic of Argenteuil) were buried and hidden with only some message, some letters describing their origin nad history, only later to be rediscovered. Hugh you greatly underestimate the power of human tradition. Valuable items can really be preserved through centuries or even millenia if there are only people devoted to store and guard them (instead of destroying them due to fanatical zeal), even risking their life. The sceptics approach, in fact, can be even treated as a some kind of insult to their notable sacrifices. While deserving the greatest honor, the guardians of the relics are instead treated as fraudsters or gullible people. It is easy to say: “I don’t know where this thing came from, so it must be false”, much harder to give it a trust and spend some effort trying not only to preserve it, but also find its real history. Some were certified on the basis of possibility rather than certainly. A wooden beam in Jerusalem: a piece of the cross; it’s not impossible. But what about a wooden beam excavated at the ruins of the ancient pagan temple (built delliberately to desecrate the place which Christian tradition maintained the execution and burial of Jesus was performed there) with attached Titulus describing who and for what crime died on this cross? Not only it is possible, it is actually very likely! Our ancestors were not so stupid and naive, as we think, actually, I am more more and convinced of that, they were much smarter, reasonable, down to earth than we are. What about other relics, preserved by judeo christian community of Jerusalem? Crown of Thorns, first mentioned in 409 AD, Holy Nails, Holy Tunics and so on? The researches of the Shroud of Turin, Sudarium of Oviedo, Tunic of Argenteuil, suggest, if not prove, that they are very likely to authentic. So if those were preserved, why should I assume others were not. Read preface of Górny’s Witnesses to Mystery. And have more faith not religious, but in humans.

The folding proposed by Wilson would not fit in the reliquary of the Mandylion as described (in size) by the inventories of the Sainte Chapelle. The problem is that when folding the Shroud the way described at your website (“One of the simplest way is to fold the Shroud twice widthwise (giving four layers), which gives a folded width of about 28 cm, and thrice lengthwise (giving eight layers), which gives a folded length of about 54 cm. This folded Shroud has a total of 32 layers, for a thickness of around 1.2 cm (32× 0.39 mm ≅ 12.48 mm), but because a folded cloth has some fluffiness, it will be between 2 to 3 cm thick, depending if it is bound in a trellis or not. The folded Shroud is 54 cm long by 28 cm wide, which fits nicely in the reliquary of the Mandylion (about 5 cm deep, 60 cm long, 40 cm wide), leaving a few centimeters all around the Shroud at the bottom of that box, and enough space to attach a trellis lengthwise.”) you don’t get the face visible.

Symeon Magister recounts that while Constantine could see the faint image in its details (eyes and ears: ophthαlmoύς κaι oτα) his two brothers‑in‑law and rivals for the throne could barely make out an outline, see https://shroudstory.wordpress.com/about/acheiropoietos jesus images in constantinople the documentary evidence/ Document II. And take also into account the Jackson’s study on foldmarks: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi11part4.pdf The extended, wider than longer portrayal of Mandylion, is one of the most often featured characteristics of it (although not unique), see the gallery in Wilson’s presentation: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/wilsonvppt.pdf See also the Templar Mandylion from Breton Calvary: http://www.cirac.org/infos uk/shroud.htm There are perhaps ways to fit the Mandylion face into the Sainte Chapelle reliquary (something similar to the way below), but they are quite bizarre, and do not correspond to the known depictions.

I have already indicated that Creation in Gen II is an extremely ancient story, it was probably based on some kind of oral tradition.[…] Nevertheless, like all primal mythologies, it has its own particular truth which mainly operates at the symbolic and psychological levels, and which spoke to the people then and can speak to us now. However, I see it as essentially a primitive attempt to explain the human situation, which works primarily at the symbolic and psychological levels, and as an attempt to explain the origin of evil. As far as I know, from your own words, you are a Catholic, right? If I may ask you a question: do you believe it? Do you believe that it explain the origin of evil? I do not demand from you belief in the story taken literally, like Biblical fundamentalists do. Nevertheless, the main question is, do you believe it? Historical and scientific accuracy is actually irrelevant here – I wrote that this story shouldt be analysed in neither scientific, nor historical, but mythical perspective. One remark: the fact that this story is a myth, doesn’t make it just moralistic fiction..","date":"2015-01-13","mins":"2:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"id":"comment-183553","author":"o_k","post":"PHPL: What I notice concerning this debate is that believers , either willingly or not, are in a position that they have to speak on behalf of God.

God is not silent in this debate, and has a Word to say. Aljones909: Again, it’s astonishing the contortions theists will engage in to deny ‘the problem of evil’. If any theists are still following this I’d ask one question: Do you find any of O,K.’s explanations credible? Please study them. Infinities, broken fingernails and all. It’s astonishing how much atheists horizons and imagination are limited. Aljones are you afraid of infinities? Besides, this is not the explanation of “the problem of evil” yet. It is just an auxiliary argument that total elimination of evil in this world is pointless and futile. That you cannot make this world perfect. “As the residents of each of these worlds do not know the alternatives, their perception of evil is actually the same. Thus elimination of some forms of evil (or we can say forms in which the evil manifests) won’t make the world any better.” This is the most ludicrous nonsense – and it’s easily testable. A simple comparison: Cambodia 1975 1979 versus Denmark 2010 2014. Bringing such examples shows you still don’t understand anything Cambodia and Denmark are within the same world. So anyway, different direction. Assume that you want to eliminate evil from this world, and you have divine powers to do so. So you have eliminated childhood brain cancer and other evils. You have eliminated earthquakes, diseases, ability to murder, ability to rape, ability to take bribes, to steal candies, and even broken fingernails. No ability to make any physical harm, nor any crimes. You can do that. Fine. But I would like to hear your answer on those two questions. Have you eliminated all evil?

Your god, his mind filled with infinities, thinks it’s much of a muchness. Is that where rationalising theism leads you? It is something different. I don’t say that in our world broken fingernail is as much great evil as cancer (because obviously it isn’t) but it is evil anyway. Another analogy. Suppose we can give weights to different kinds of evil (which is not true in general, yet allows us to discriminate between “greater” and “lesser” evils). Let’s assume also that God is infinitely good by definition (so we can assign God +∞ symbol). Let’s assign number 0 for those things that are morally neutral, that they contain no evil at all. Then let’s assume that the most terrible evil in this world is childhood brain cancer. Let’s assign to it a number 10. In this scale we can assign 1 for broken fingernail. So we live in the world with “the range of evils” from 10 (the most terrible evils) to 0 (no evil). Yet in theory there could have been another world where there happens Evils More Terrible than Childhood Brain Cancer (EMTCBC). Let’s assign for EMTCBC 100. So in this world relation between EMTBC and childhood cancer is like relation between childhood cancer and broken fingernail. Then let’s consider another hypothetical world, where there is no childhood cancer, and the greatest evil is a broken fingernail. So we have 3 potential worlds for God to create: a)World with EMTBC as the most terrible evil. Scale of evil: 100 to 0 b)World with childhood cancer as the most terrible evil. Scale of evil: 10 to 0 c) World with a broken fingernail as the most terrible evil. Scale of evil 1 to 0. At first glance seems that the world a) is more terrible than b) which is also more terrible than c). Yet there is no difference between 100, 10 and 1 in comparison to God’s +∞ ! And each of this worlds can be rescaled so the relative scale between the most terrible evil in each of them will be always from 1 (the most terrible evil) to 0 (no evil at all). As the residents of each of these worlds do not know the alternatives, their perception of evil is actually the same. Thus elimination of some forms of evil (or we can say forms in which the evil manifests) won’t make the world any better. David Mo: I repeat you: I have put here five possible solutions to the problem of evil and God. Do you have any evidence in favour of one of them? No. Neither of those 5 “solutions” may be true, as they are not the only ones possible. There is at least a sixth solution. My “limited perspective”? You cannot explain the contradiction of God and evil.[…] But the problem of contradiction between God and evil is different because it implies facts and logic. Facts: the existence of sufferings. Logic: contradiction between good and evil. We have no means to test any hypothetical solution Neither your facts, nor your “logic” are complete. And as they are incomplete, you cannot say there is a contradiction between omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent God and existence of evil. Aljones909: What (or who) do you think is the source of this evil? That’s the question! We can say: definitely not God.

I challenge any theist to tell me they can’t distinguish between an agonising toothache and the discomfort of too tight underwear. This is something entirely different which I described many times.

Most people are happy. Yes. So you see this world is not as bad, as terrible that some guys complaining about the problem of evil would cry. But this does not mean that people would be happy in the “perfect” world I suppose rather opposite that had we lived in such a “perfect” world no man (nor woman) would be happy. David Mo: You persist in doing incorrect questions. Incorrect? Or maybe contrary, correct, but just inconvenient for you? Neither Aljones nor I are “perfects” and we don’t intend to imagine a “perfect” world. The problem implied as far as I am concerned is the incompatibility between a perfect God and the existence of the extreme evil and suffering. So if you don’t insist on creating perfect world, you should not insist on the “problem of evil”. Because this (apparent) paradox would be still present if there is ANY evil and suffering in this world. As I am trying to show, you cannot objectively state what is “extreme” and “moderate” or “minor” evils. The terms “extreme”, “moderate”, “minor” does not describe absolute, but relative properties. You can of course describe evils as “greater” and “lesser” and set them in order, but to state that some of them are “extreme” or “moderate” you need reference scale. You and aljones do not understand that and thus fall in another fallacy. Had some now “extreme” evils been eliminated by magical intervention, other, lesser evils would become “extreme”. If one likes to play with such “rationalists'” sophisms, he needs to know precise meanings of what he states. You can ask to the parents of a child unexpectedly healed of a cancer of brain if they are happier. They will look at you as if you were mad. Yes. However the point is that if you heal a child from brain cancer you will make the world better. But not necessarily if you magically eliminate brain cancer from this world. Catholics believe that God does intervene in this world, performing miracles curing diseases for example. There are hundreds of such instances verified by Vatican and many more unverifed. I suppose you don’t believe that, but assume those reports are true. Can you then state that God does not interest about the sufferings of His poor children on Earth? What I (and you) don’t understand is why this perfect god don’t gives us this perfect world directly without doing suffer innocent children. No David Mo, I understand why. It is you that don’t understand and thus don’t understand the Christianity at all. I don’t know if men would feel happy in a “perfect” world without any evil, but if you are a Christian, you ought to believe that. Jesus of Galilee had promised a Kingdom of eternal bliss and the Christian churches promise the Heaven for the good men and women at least. Serial killers and brain cancer will not exist in this world… I suppose. Yes. Could perfect God create a perfect world? Of course. Both Paradise described in the Book of Genesis and future promised Kingdom of God are such worlds. But why our current world is not such one? Because there is one minor problem… To help you realise what the problem is I want to ask you another question.

But I would be specially concerned with the extreme evil and the suffering of children. I suppose that a more efficient guardian angel would suffice. So blasphemies, spreading hearsay, some minor violence, yes but suffering of children no. So you are introducing some new ethical standards, new reality, where some bad deeds are allowed (physically), while others not. Are you sure those are certainly “lesser evils” than children sufferings? So children cannot suffer, but adults (and children grow up of course) can. Nice concept of equality and justice. Some people categories must suffer, while others are saved from that. Nice segregation. Most normal humans, if they had knowledge of the situation and they had the power to act, would have intervened in a heartbeat. In the immortal words of Christopher Hitchens “heaven watched on with indifference”. So what Heaven should have done? Sent a bolt of the blue and some angel police or peaceking forces intervention?

Nevertheless, as I am moderately satisfied with the answer, I can go further. David Mo: There is a misunderstanding here. Aljones and I don’t postulate the elimination of any evil There is no misunderstanding, but your attempts to mislead and distract people from what you HAVE actually said. I remind you: January 2, 2015 at 3:16 am The relation between science and God is not a problem. Science works pretty well without the God hypothesis (you know, Laplace). And the believers in God (most of them, at least) have no problem with science. The problem is philosophic: the concept of a god which is good and creates (or tolerates) the evil is an oxymoron. Here you stated that the all good, all powerful God tolerating evil (ANY evil) is a contradiction => such God (esencially the Christian God) doesn’t exist. And that’s completely wrong. But the appalling effects of some extreme forms of evil, that are two different things. You can objectiely state what is “extreme” evil and what is only “moderate” evil. From the God’s all powerful perspective all, even the most terrible evils of this world may be just “moderate” and very easy to fix and amend in the future world. That’s the first fallacy you made. In my metaphoric supposition of a “guardian angel” (some inhibitory mechanism against aggression), this one will be able to stop the criminal offender when he has started (but not accomplished) the act. So, the evil exists. It is the criminal intention. And the freedom for evil is preserved. If the problem is preserve both freedom and evil. A “guardian angel” which would make perpetrating crime impossible… Your naivete is extreme… Like all those fools who don’t even consider what they postulate. I suppose you haven’t read this book? It came to my mind immediately when you formulated the problem http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation on the Spot Wizja Lokalna by popular Polish s f. Writer Stanisław Lem. On margin I must say that he declared himself atheist, for similar reasons that you claim (the imperfect world) although actually his relations towards religion were extremely complex and equivocal (for example Catholic priest was present at his funeral). Here you have a part of the summary of that book: The other state, Luzania, constitutes the most significant treatment of the topic of an “ideal state” in Lem (and many would argue, in all science fiction). Their most prominent accomplishment is the creation of “ethicsphere” (compare “atmosphere”). They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized nanobots called “bystry” (“quickies” in English) that serve to control matter in the ‘quickated’ areas. The primary function of the ‘quickies’ is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word ethicsphere). Hence, it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically. If you try to strike your neighbor, your hand will be stopped by the suddenly increased air viscosity, (although you will not be hurt either). If you try to drown, the water will push you out. Doing non physical harm, such as by pestering, criticizing, and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible, although in such a case the ‘quickies’ would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers. There is a large protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere, and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so, but they have not succeeded yet. Here you have your “ideal state” where evil is apparently eliminated, and making harm to any living entity impossible. Unfortuantely this turns out not to be a paradise but hell instead. A terrific totalitarian state with totalitarian control over its citizens. One of the most terrific prisons you can imagine. That’s your ideal world. That’s ideal world you unbelievers demanded God to create. But this does not mean that ideal world is impossible. No. There is one another element Lem missed (or didn’t look at it in a proper way).

It required a struggle between competing individuals for dominance, and the dissolution of those unable to adapt, in fact a “selfish gene”. This pervades all of Creation, is the product of a wise God, but has consequences for the problem of evil. For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living. For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth: It’s not a “selfish gene” created by God to boost evolution the principal source of the problem.

This is not only a parody of the communist system. Although not speaking about God, he discusses the disastrous effects of playing God, an attempts to eliminate evil. This topic in fact appears in many of his stories. And “ethicsphere” doesn’t differ at all from your conception of “guardian angels” introducing permament police state against aggression. It is exactly the same. Both stories deal with failures caused by human limitations. Good ideas with bad means. Yes. And complete elimination of children suffering for example, is also a good idea… We are not speaking of finite men and totalitarian systems but about a perfect entity called “God”. We are speaking about finite men, I can assure you. About finite men like you who considering themselves wiser than God would like to dictate Him how He should have organize this world. Isn’t it what you and aljones909 are doing? I have said “any evil” nowhere, with or without capital letters. I’m sorry if my sentence confused you. Don’t try to deceive us! It was obvious what you meant, and your sneaky attempts to persuade us to you meant something different than what you meant won’t help you. You stated (January 2, 2015 at 3:16 am): “The problem is philosophic: the concept of a god which is good and creates (or tolerates) the evil is an oxymoron.” Of course “the evil” means “any evil”. Later, when you realised your mistake (that’s I suppose why you held back from answering my question ) you tried to mislead us that your position was different: Aljones and I don’t postulate the elimination of any evil, but the appalling effects of some extreme forms of evil, that are two different things This is the most absurd sentence I have read to you. Every moralist knows that good and evil are gradual attributes. Aljones909: “You cannot objectiely state what is “extreme” evil and what is only “moderate” evil.”. Extreme evil is childhood brain cancer. Moderate evil is when I get soap in my eye. It is nice to see that we have such moral authorities knowing better than God from His throne what is good and what is bad, what is “extreme”, and what is “moderate” evil in the cosmic perspective… So elimination of only some forms of evil? So some other forms of evil can be tolerated (by God I assume)? Which ones? How can you state then that God tolerates all forms of evil? Maybe from His perspective all forms of evil still present on this world are only “moderate”? Maybe He spared us some much more “extreme” forms of evil that none of us even can imagine (far worse than childhood brain cancer)? Don’t you see that those human cries about “extreme” evil are nonsense from this perspective? Had even childhood brain cancer and other evils you consider exteme would have been eliminated from this world by Allmighty God, there would be still other forms of evil considered “extreme” by entites living in your imaginary “better” world? This is nonsense… And the pain that a child suffers now is never erased by future events. It is pain. Perhaps only God knows. But then his knowledge is not comprehensible for human beings and you are defending irrationalism. There are many things in this world that are not comprehensible for human beings, yet they are real. Do you call them also “irrational”? Thanks them, that the first caveman were “irrational”.

But if you say that you can assert something about “God” (“God exists”, “God is good”, “God is omniscient”, etc.), you are an irrationalist. Your attempts to cast calumniest towards me are just… irrrational. NOTE: It is not only “moral authorities” that think so. Every normal human being thinks that spiting in the neighbour’ soup is a qualitatively different evil to kill a child. Let me answer it in this way. Of course from the human, limited perspective spiting in the neighbour’ soup is a different, smaller evil than killing a child. Yet God’s perspective is different. He can for example turn bad deeds into much greater good. Classical example may be the story of Joseph in Egypt, while being sold by his brothers into slavery (definitely extremely bad deed), in the end due to God directing the events, this saved his whole family from hunger. We don’t know all consequences of our deeds. It may turn out that apparently small evil would have in the end much greater consequences than great evil. Of course this doesn’t modify moral responsibility, which is greater for greater crimes (like rape or murder) than smaller ones (cursing in public), yet we cannot say that total elimination of some forms evil by external intervention will make that there will be less evil in the Universe. It (evil) will simply change its form, and we will still be as far from Paradise, as we have been. If I can give a similar example from another area: Every child knows than there are ten natural numbers in the range of 1 to 10: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 There are 5 odd numbers in the range 1 to 10: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 There are also 5 even numbers in the range 1 to 10: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 So it seems that there is fewer (just half of them) odd (or even) natural numbers, than both of them. Yet if we take a range from 1 to infinity, their quantity is the same: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9…. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10… By analogy, treating unlimited God within limited range of human perspective is simply erroneous..","date":"2015-01-11","mins":"5:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"id":"comment-182535","author":"o_k","post":"Dave B: You are Catholic, just as me, right?

All these comments and you finally agree with me! No, I don’t agree with you. You simply misses my point, which I haven’t fully voiced yet. You still don’t understand what I mean and this (inability to make this world perfect) is just a part of explanation. My conclusion: Why have we to worry about a contradictory god that we don’t understand? How can we state anything about an entity that we don’t understand? God is not contradictory simply your perspective is limited, and focused on the worng aspect. And we don’t need to understand fully some entity to state something about it. We don’t fully understand star evolution, or functioning of living cells, yet we can state something about those matters. “If egregious suffering did not exist non believers would just complain about stubbed toes”. Exactly! For such entities, who would not know “more serious” (from our perspective) pains (like cancer), this would be “extreme evil.” Their suffering, apparently insignificant (from our perspective) would nevertheless be the same. The ‘problem of evil’ addresses the world as it is Not only, because we need to consier also alternatives, other worlds that could have been instead of ours. Childhood brain cancer is no different to a broken fingernail? This is evil, and this is evil. Of course one seems to be much more serious but only from our perspective. Not from the unlimited perspective of all infinite good God. Imagine yourself that they stole you 10 $. That’s bad. Then imagine yourself that they stole you 1000 $. That’s worse (100 times), isn’t it? Yet assume you are very rich, you own say 100 000 000 000 =100 billion $. What’s then the difference between stealing 1000 $ and 10 $ (respectively 0.00000001 and 0.0000000001 of your total money)? Little. The main problem is not whether they stole from you 1000 $ or 10 $, but the fact of stealing. Similarly with infinite good God. The main problem is the presence of evil, its scale is irrelevant. Of course, in limited human perspective there are greater and lesser evils, yet this can only be callibrated versus human scale. What’s the difference between 0.1, 10, 100, 1000 versus infinity? Belief that Evil can be eliminated (or even reduced as a whole) via God’s magical intervention, and elimination of physical ability to kill, rape, steal, as well as natural disasters and diseases, is just extremely naive. Turning stones into bread is no solution. This is no way. But still there is another way. To know which, you must know what actually is the source of evil.

Had there been no childhood brain cancer, no starvation and no earthquakes, the equivalents of David Mo would cry in such Universe that God is bad , because he didn’t prevent such extreme evils like broken nail tips and kids dying from overeating. On the other hand, you cannot be certain whether God has not spared you potentially much more terrible (in human sense) evils than human brain cancer, as humanity doesn’t experience them. Total elimination of some forms of “extreme” evil imposed by Higher Forces won’t make this world any better. It is impossible, in this world. And costs could easily outweight the apparent benefits. Simply other forms of evil would become “extreme” then. In Lem’s novel, which I gave as an example, the introduction of “ethicsphere” didn’t change Luzania for better.

Assuming these three treatments were independent, then 1 in every 8000 crucifixions had injuries similar to those on the shroud. Let us suppose that the Romans crucified Jews for about 400 years, at a rate of 1 a day except during rebellions when the number rose to 500 a day according to Josephus.

Http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm Moreover, I once heard a radio (an internal station of one Catholic University) interview with one specialist in carbon dating (who also published an interesting textbook on carbon dating, easliy available online), the interview was published on his private website (which makes clear that the author is atheist). The topic of the interview was of course the Shroud of Turin and scientific examination of it. What can I say about this roughly 15 minutes interview? As far as I study the topic of the Shroud I have never heard such insolence, such arrogance, such pride, such overconfidence in 1988 carbon datings (called by the intervied “the only true scientific examination” ), such contempt for other scientific examinations of the Shroud (he once mentioned 3 D examination of the Shroud questioning “what’s that a kind of study?”)., Even the interviewer, it was apparent from her voice, that she began to lost patience. In the latter part of the interview, when our proffesor reminded himself what audience would listen to that, mentioned that as (according to him) it would be miracle had the results be skewed from the 1st to 14th century so the only hope for all authenticist is miracle, that maybe something happened during Resurrection that changed the results but no other way. But it was obvious, even if not voiced, that he didn’t intend to believe that, and this suggestion was brought forward more to ridicule proponents of authenticity (some of whom, as we know, adhere to this theory, absurd for atheists and not only), than as serious hypothesis.

This is Marion’s analysis, not mine of what both the Shroud and the Tunic show for some reason. I hope he knew what he was writing about, as he was performing those experiments. The position of the cross is strange to me as well, but maybe there was some rationale behind that (falls?). If this is not done, then the cross piece would either be simply nailed directly across the upright, or have a mortice cut out for a tenon in the upright to fit in. In the first case it would be very difficult to stand the completed cross up with a body hanging on it (the Good Thief’s beam looks like this), and in the second the crossbeam would have to be much thicker than suggested (maybe 15cm or so) to accommodate both the tenon. According to Gaza Valdes the Good Thief Patibulum has a mortice. It does not have to be wide only to fit the tenon. As to weight, my cross was made of 6″ x 4″ (15cm x 10cm) pine and weighed about 50kg. However, I only carried it; I don’t know how stable such a narrow cross would be to hang a victim on.

Why should they, as those were measures made by themselves, why bother them that they did something wrong in their job? If any of them had thought that the result was ‘statistically meaningless’ they would have said so, and if that was so of a majority, the report would have reflected that. They had no reason to hide their objections to the sampling on purely statistical grounds Really, for what purpose? It was their work, their paper, another addition to the list of publications which determines their careers. Why should they raise any objections? It was against their interest. The idea that they signed it “without any questions” “with no second thoughts”, or frightened that they would be classed as flat earthers is not tenable. In fact, the whole matter was engineered in the way, that nobody had any interest in disputing the results. The scientists remember they were not freelance, idealist explorers of the Nature (I mean the Universe, not the journal). They were part of scientific teams. And like in every team, there is a leader, and the subordinates and there is also “team spirit”. To raise objections against the leaders, to break the team in the matter of principles? No way. And that of course means putting your career at risk. The Nature. As you remember, the results were first announced on the press conference on 13th October 1988. The paper was sent to the Nature only by 5th December, published 16th February. Now rhetorical question: do you really think that Nature could afford rejection of that paper? Do you? The radiocarbonists. They certainly have no interest in disputing the 1988 results, and thus the reliabilty of their method as a whole, by admiting that there may be errors. No matter their personal believes. The other scientists? Who would dare to question 1988 carbon datings, risking his or her reputation as the scientist? The carbon dating is a well established scientific method, questioning it is like, I don’t know, questioning special relativity, or human evolution, or something.

And if this was the half of the shroud at the end of weaving, the total width would be double: 117.2 cm more or less. But in that case, the Shroud was 6.2 cm wider when leaving the loom than currently. If we take this into account, than: The lower limit of Assyrian cubit: 8.05×2.16 The average of Assyrian cubit: 8.00×2.15 The higher limit of Assyrian cubit: 7.96×2.13. Curiously, it is today that the Shroud is 8×2 Assyrian cubits, with margin of error no greater than 3 %. It is possible (though I am not in favor of this) that side strip was deliberately cut and sewn again to obtain a perfect Assyrian 8×2 cubit measure The compromise is average of the two: 56.6 cm. Then the Shroud is 7.72×2.07 cubits. If we take approximate Shroud dimensions as 440×110 cm, and a cubit measure of 55 cm, then we have exactly 8×2 cubit proportion. I hardly believe this is accidental, no matter what Barta’s “primeval fold” analysis suggest.

Centro Espanol de Sindonologia CES  On pages 6 7 she has very interesting section 1.3 “The Shroud’s dimenison”.

On November 19, 2013 at 7:55 am, I wrote: Yes, there are some uncertainities, but regularity of Shroud dimenisons expressed in integers is striking! It suggests that the original TS dimensions hasn’t changed much through centuries. The units that were used to measure the size of the TS were either cubits circa 55 cm long, or ell measuring 110 cm, that is 2×55 cm. Or, according to Ada Grosii: “Thus, the Shroud’s length would be 56 tefachim (436.8 cm) and its width 14 tefachim (13+1, that is 109.2 cm = 101.4 + 7.8 cm); on the other hand, always keeping in mind that these measurements are approximate, we could also evaluate the Shroud’s dimensions by the tefach sochek (9.33 cm), and we would obtain even more interesting numbers: 47 tefachim (438,52 cm) by 12 tefachim (11+1, i.e. 111.96 cm = 102.63 + 9.33 cm).” 7 tefachim = 6 sochek =1 ammah (cubit). 7 *7.8 cm=54.6 cm =1 Assyrian cubit! 6*9.33 cm =55.98 cm. Thus the opinion of Grossi: “This line of reasoning certainly suggests great caution: playing with numbers, any result can be achieved” is unjustified, if we only keep some rules, only the results that Shroud dimensions allow can be obtained. So the Shroud measures 14×56 tefachim, or 48×12 sochek (the number 47 is “almost” 48, the measure sochek is probably slightly overestimated), or 8×2 cubits. 7 tefachim = 6 sochek =1 ammah (cubit).

Playing with guys like Charles has always required a lot of patience. I think it is not because the Shroud or any pro Christian arguments challenge their views, various atheists, agnostics, “secular humanists”, “rationalists” etc. Try to discredit Christianity. In their view it is simply some outdated superstition, no matter what apologists say. No argument would challenge their (atheists) view, simply because they “know better”. The true reason why some guys try any cynical tricks to discredit Christianity is different. It is not because they feel their worldview is challenged. Contrary, they simply want to challenge Christian worldview. To show that they are “wiser” and better” then simple, “naive” believers. Pride, that drives their action.

We simply know that northern France had large early relic collections, that it was the custom to tag relics as a mark of authenticity and that we have collections of relics tagged as coming from Jerusalem including some said to be from the Lord’s Tomb that ended up very close to Lirey. So there is important work to be done here to expand on this but sadly I am not the one to do it. ‘It eludes me why any Passion relics should be taken direct from Jerusalem to ancient Gaul.’ Well, it is well documented from tags on the relics themselves that they were see my earlier postings about relics from ‘the Lord’s Tomb ‘ that are known in collection close to Lirey. Northern France was avid for relics and there were large collections, including those of Charlemagne, early on. They were added to by the Crusades. As the Shroud is first documented in northern France, overwhelmingly the most likely source of its origin lies somewhere within these collections but, as I have said above, I have not the skills or time to do the research that is needed for this. A week ago or so, I bought a new academic book by Jerzy Pysiak, from the University of Warsaw, titled Król i Korona Cierniowa: Kult relikwii we Francji Kapetyngów (“The King and the Crown of Thorns: Cult of the relics in Capetian France”) http://www.wuw.pl/ksiegarnia/product info.php?products id=5002. Although I have to read it yet, but after a brief look it seems like a mine of the sources about relics, both from Carolignian and Crusade eras. However, there seems to be no word about the Shroud at all. There is no mention of Lirey, nor Geoffrey de Charny or any related people in the book Index. It is hardly possible that there had been no serious research on transfer of relics directly to France, after over 100 years of studies on history of the Shroud, begining with Chevalier, who traced its history back to Lirey. The only results were findings of some other alleged burial cloths, and some fragments of others. This way seems fruitless, and gives rather no promise for the future. It is only demagogy of yours Charles, to distract attention from the Wilson’s Mandylion theory (which gave some positive results), using logically flawed appeal to the future arguments. Although it is still not that likely, the most interesting alternative for me would be to chart the well documented collecting of relics from Jerusalem by Pulcheria, the sister of the emperor Theodosius II, in the early fifth century. This was briefly suggested in R. Hynek’s 1937 book. The 14th century Byzantine historian Nikefor Kallisto claimed that sindonon kai othonion were already stored in the Blachaernae church in Pulcheria times, the problem is how much this late source is reliable. And still we can be certain there were more than a single burial cloth in Byzantine collection. Nevertheless this track seems to be abandoned by the scholars, for some reasons. No it doesn’t override the gaps. It provides no explanation of where the Shroud was in those crucial first five hundred ( repeat five hundred) years before the sixth century and again does not fill in the gap after 1204. Provides an explanation the Shroud was hidden inside the walls of Edessa, for 300 500 years. Many other relics (Tunic of Argenteuil, Titulus Crucis) shared similar fate for large part of their histoy. Then again the chance that the Image of Edessa and the Shroud are the same is extremely tenuous – and this is being generous ! Nonsense. Once one begins to look at the alternatives, the Edessa theory fades quickly out of the picture as a likely possibility. Again. I can only repeat that to stick to the Edessa theory without even mentioning more plausible alternatives for the arrival of the Shroud in northern France is simply bad history. A bad history is what you and the ‘Academia’ do. I think myself that the blind prejudice lies in sticking to one possible, but extraordinarily unlikely, solution so dogmatically that one is not even able to consider others.

(along with the opinions of Scavone and Tycner Wolicka) proves what I always say: in historical research, you can make all kinds of extrapolations… Of course… 4 Since the terms “Mandylion” and “Image of Edessa” were well known in Constantinople at that time, there is no good reason why Constantine VII would not have used one of them in his list if he would really have wanted to include the Mandylion in his list of relics of the Passion. Reminder: the term Mandylion itself first appears around 990 in a biography of a monk Paul from Mt. Latros (although I saw claims of earlier apperance) and is quite rarely used. The Mandylion is described in various sources as mantile, himation, tetradiplon,cheiromaktron, manutergium among others. Effectively, if we compare the list of Damascene and the list of Constantine VII, we find out that they are VERY SIMILAR in their content and that they DOESN’T mention specifically the Mandylion as being a relic of the Passion. All the lists about the relics of the Passion are very similar, because the set of items was well known, and it not necessarly mean that all those relics were in possesion of Emperors at given time. Some lists include even the Holy Sepulchr itself! Of course, with lots of speculations and extrapolations, people can come to a different conclusion (Scavone and Tycner Wolicka’s point of views are there to prove this), but if we avoid to do those kind of wild spéculations and extrapolations (like I think I have just done so) It is impossible to avoid wild speculations here and you hadn’t done so. Your reasoning has several hidden assumptions, of which you are maybe not even aware. For example you assume that John Damascene knew the true nature of the (contemporary version) of the Mandylion in Edessa, which is not certain, he probably knew only legendary version of it. You also assume that Constantine VII shared Damascene views, which is another assumption. And so on. A few words to Dave: The Shroud Arcaulf saw in Jerusalem was said to have been given to Charlemagne in 797 AD, and may have been the “Shroud of Compiegne” in the south near Toulouse, and destroyed during the French Revolution. We don’t know whether it was the same Shroud. Perhaps, or perhaps not. There is a document, mentioned by Waliszewski and van Haelst, suggesting that in the 9th century the Shroud was still in Jerusalem. There is another latin document from 1190 suggesting that some shroud, or copy of it, along wit some fragments of the Crown of Thorns were given to Charlemagne (confused with Charles the Bald). The matter is extremely complex there. It seems also that the Shroud of Compiegne and Sindon Munda from Kornelimünster, which exists up to this day, were two halves of the same cloth, 4 metres long, 1 wide. And BTW: Compiegne is in the northern France. Perhaps you confused it with the Shroud of Cadouin, almost certainly a fake from the 1st Crusade times.

Not true, there are no references to Abgar nor even Edessa in the Robert de Calri’s version for example. And the lists of relics while mentioning an item that could be either Mandylion or the Shroud, rarely give precise description what is it, or references to Abgar legend. Thus confusion sometimes. See Scavone’s paper http://shroudstory.wordpress.com/about/acheiropoietos jesus images in constantinople the documentary evidence/ For example: “In 1200 the inventory of Antonius of Novgorod similarly names two linen cloths: linteum and “linteum representing the face of Christ” Riant, Exuviae 223:. . . Monstrantur in aedibus aureis Caesaris: Crux veneranda, Corona [spinea], Spongia, Clavi, iterum Sanguis, Chlamys purpurea, Lancea,. . . Linteum faciem Christi repraesentans. . .; quae omnia in sola ecclesia parva B. Dei Genitricis reperiuntur. Is it the Shroud or the Mandylion? After all, from ancient sources, we know that other relics of Christ’s Passion (like the lance, the sponge, the wood of the cross, the crown of thorns, etc.) were transferred that way directly from Jerusalem to Constantinople for their protection, without ever spending one day in Edessa… Question: Why those transfers are known and not the transfer of the Shroud? Not all of those transfers are known the transfer of the lance or the Crown of Thorns are unknown, for example. Sorry, but this is another pure extrapolation made by people who desperately want to back up the hypothesis of Wilson. First of all, in the Narratio, we can find 2 versions of the same legend and one of them still locate the action before the Passion of Christ (which can be seen as the “traditional” version of the legend). This is important because if the second version was due to a better understanding of the hypothetical bloody nature of the Mandylion, it is highly probable that the author of the Narratio would have only kept the new version (while putting the focus on the presence of blood in the sweat, which is not the reality), while leaving aside the “traditional” version of the legend. No, he couldn’t. Remember, this is Byzantium. Despotic Eastern society. Some things cannot be related there directly, but only in a hidden, suggestive way. You must read between the verses to understand the proper meaning of the message. Imagine such situation: the long awaited legendary Mandylion arrives in Constantnople, and then suddenly comes some high ranked priest and shows them the relics, and tells to the people: “Sorry guys, the whole traditional version of the Mandylion legend that your grandmas told you while you were children is simply a bulls&*%^. It was not created before the Passion, look there are bloodmarks visible. Moreover, contrary to the false old version, it is not the image of the face, but the burial shroud. The whole hitherto tradition was nothing but a bunch of lies.” Of course such scenario was impossible. And so it was impossible to discard the traditional version. Instead, a new version was suggested. But only suggested, with a subtle indication (but only indication!) that it is the correct one! Read that part of Naaration, and you understand. It clearly states that this version was “previously unknown”, and that it is “not unbelievable or lacking witnesses” Those are only suggestions. There is not even directly mentioned that there are bloodmarks on the Mandylion (which would discredit the “traditional” version) but there are clear allusions to them, and everyone knows the point! It is a mastery of composition of the text. And no word is used there without a reason. Thus there cannot be the slighest doubts to the presence of bloodmarks on the Image of Edessa. Secondly, and this is more important, the location of the action in Gethsemane is probably due to the presence of the word “sudarium” in another previous manuscript of the legend, which is used to describe the cloth that was used to Jesus to wipe his face, leading to the miraculous imprint. This previous manuscript if called “The letter of the three patriarchs to Emperor Theophilus of Constantinople”, which is dated to the first half of the 9th century. Even though this text used the word “sudarium” to describe the cloth with the miraculous imprint, it still located the action BEFORE the Passion of Christ (the letter specified that the miraculous imprint happened “while the Lord and Saviour was on earth”), which is similar to the “traditional” version of the Abgar legend, which locates the miraculous imprint some days before the beginning of Jesus’ Passion! In fact, it most probably used that term “sudarium” simply because the author of the text said that it was Christ’s sweat (instead of the water he used to washed his face, which is found in the first versions of the legend) that was used by him to produce the miraculous imprint OF HIS FACE ONLY (the text is specific about the fact that Jesus only wiped his face with the cloth). Note that, in this version, the sweat of Christ had NOTHING TO DO with the bloody sweat described by St Luke in the story of the Passion… No chance Yannick. The allusions are clear, and I see no other possibility than the real presence of the bloodstains on the Image of Edessa. Otherwise, the whole story of Gethsemane wouldn’t have been even invented for what damn purpose? And my advice: forget all those fairy tales, about creating the Mandylion before the beginning of Jesus’ Passion. Forget the “traditional” story, forget the Gethsemane version, forget the Damascene or Acts of Thaddeus for a moment. It is all eyewashing. It is all irrelevant here, at this moment. The only important thing is what Byzantines saw on the so called Image of Edessa, when it was brought to Constantinople on 16 August 944, and went into procession through the whole city..","date":"2014-01-20","mins":"3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"id":"comment-73923","author":"o_k","post":"And concerning the 3 other relics (the wood of the cross, the sponge and the lance), there really is a reference about their direct transfer from Jerusalem to Constantinople.

They rather tried to avoid it, directing discussion on other tracks. So to the point: the set of the documents from Constantine VII epoch is an extremely interesting one, as it gives us through various allusions the characteristics of the Mandylion transferred to Constantinople in 944. Reading between the lines (the ability which ‘Academia’ certainly does not possess) one can guess what this item was. And here we have: * reference to image created by sweat and blood in Getsemanne in Narratio, clearly showing there was a blood on the Mandylion, and that the image was extremely faint, like sweat imprint. * the same in the sermon of Gregory Referendarius, along with the allusions to the side wound, leaving little doubt that it was actually there (why otherwise would he have even mentioned this?) * previously unmentioned Chronographia by Symeon Magister, who wrote that contrary to Constantine, his two brothers in low, sons of usurper Romanos I Lekapenos, didn’t see the image (thus they were unworthy to wield power in God’s eyes). This is commonly reported trait of the Shroud, if you are too close, you cannot see anything. * Some vague expression in 958 Constantine VII letters to his troops, suggesting that perhaps there was an image of Christ on one holy cloth in possesion of the Emperor, something previously unmentioned compare with Robert de Clari’s realation. I know only one object that fits all of those characteristics: the Shroud of Turin. Now two simple straightforward questions to Charles, Yannick, and any other opponent of Wilson’s ideas. 1. Could the Mandylion transferred to he Constantinople in 944 be anything else other than the Shroud of Turin? Yes or No. 2.

Yannick, it really doesn’t concern me right now. The fact is the the Mandylion was used as a tool in theological disputes, but this: 1) doesn’t make it a fake 2) is really irrelevant at this moment.

Question: Maybe I mist it, but I would like you to explain to me how in the world you can think the shroud that Arculf saw could have been the same thing as the Mandylion, while we know that, in 670 A.D., the Mandylion was still kept in Edessa and not in Jerusalem? I don’t understand how you can think the Shroud of Arculf could have been the same thing as the Mandylion… There are many possible scenarios. Some assume that the Shroud was transferred to Jerusalem and later to Constantinople in the 7th century, then, during Iconoclast period in the 8th it was transferred once again to Edessa, where it became (a new old version of) the Mandylion. In theory, it is possible, though improbable. The fact is that the history of the relics may be much more complicated, than everyone thought. When my new post about Titulus Crucis appears on the scene, you will understand.

Using standard way of dating text (which, strangely is not applied to the New Testament by the most “scholars” contrary to other classical texts) this firmly dates Acts to 62 AD (had they not been part of the Bible, no scholar would ever question this dating). Now to the Gospels. As we know that the Acts were written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke, as a second volume, we know that Gospel of Luke must have been written before Acts, perhaps about 60 AD. As the Gospel of Luke seems dependent on Gospel of Mark, it must have been written earlier, perhaps in the 50s or even 40s. As to the Matthew, as it is also dependent on Mark, but not directly dependent on Luke, it must have been written parallelly to the latter, circa 60 AD. The aramaic prototype of Matthew, mentioned by several Church Fathers may be earlier, perhaps dating to the 40s. As for John, he must have written after the death of Peter (64 67 AD) but there are no direct indications about destruction of the Jerusalem, so it is likely to be written in 67 70 AD.

Mostly agree, but: Thus Luke’s mise en scene traverse is Nazareth – Jerusalem – Rome! The church is now “global”, has “arrived” and this makes for a satisfying conclusion. Luke is not interested in recording the death of either of his leading characters Paul or Peter, it is not part of his “proclamation” and its omission is a weak argument for assigning either Acts or Luke a prior date. That’s hypothesis (and rather proposed ad hoc to maintain the late dates for the Gospels), not the facts. The facts are that neiher Paul’s nor Peter’s death are recorded in Acts and the simplest explanation is that it had not occured yet when Luke was finishing Acts. Otherwise such omission, contrary to what the readers knew, would be extremely strange. …I think all these are strong arguments for a relatively late compilation of the gospels. I don’t think so. The mission to gentiles started very early, with the baptism of Cornelius (if not earlier). The actions and sayings of Jesus would have given rise to many oral traditions, and typical of such societies would soon have acquired a set form to be learned by rote by those trained to proclaim them. They would have soon been committed to writing….It is not necessary to assert an earlier compilation into their present final form. Nor to deny it. There is nothing that would preclude the creation of the present Gospels before 70 AD. The only reason why they are dated after 70 AD is the anti Christian sentiment for which a claim that the Gospels are late written, falsified documents is a necessity. To defend this view, they utilize every weak (or even imaginary) argument, disregarding much stronger arguments for pre 70 authorship of the Gospels by traditional Four Evangelists.

The Gospels are stories about Jesus, not the problems (greater or smaller) of the early church. Further evidence is suggested in the destruction of the temple, omitted in earlier Mark, but which seems to have already happened “as prophesied” in the other three gospels, although perhaps it might not have been so difficult to foresee. There is nowhere a mention that the prophecy has already fulfilled contrary to for example, prophecy of Peter’s death in John 21:18. With the expectation of an early Parousia, little point in committing the account to writing would be seen, as everything was soon to come to an end. Parousia. This modern pseudo theory, and really absurd one. According to it, Jehovah’s Witnesses for example should not write anything. Can you (or anyone) give real (and not imaginative) reasons why the Gospels couldn’t have been written before 70 AD?

They do not have any conclusive evidence for dating Gospels post 70, yet they claim it as a fact. You claim the Gospels were written before 70 AD you are religious fanatic. You claim the Gosples were written after 70 AD you are “objective”. Similar issue with the Shroud. You dispute 1988 C14 tests, and maintain it is authentic you are mindless fanatic. You claim that 1988 C14 tests ultimately exposed the Shroud as a fake you are “scientific”. This is a mafia way of handling things… You are concerned that a later compilation of the gospels compromises the argument for their factual reliability I didn’t claim that. My point is entirely different. It is about how easy they would have been to undermine, had they been written either before or after 70 AD. If they were written before 70 AD, when the Temple stood still, there were Jewish authorities, many witnesses alive then claims that Gospel image of Jesus has been fabricated by the disciples would be virtually pointless case. But if the Gospels were written after 70 AD, after destruction of the Temple, wiping out the system, destruction of archives, and when there were few witnesses alive then the critics have much easier job in claiming that the Gospels were late, fabricated documents, with no reference to historical Jesus. That’s what the critics need, and that’s why they insist on post 70 AD dating. For me, it is largely irrelevant, whether the Gospels were written before or after 70 AD they still may be true. But for them, it is crucial..","date":"2015-04-21","mins":"4:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"id":"comment-197030","author":"o_k","post":"Dave: OK: The only argument you seem able to muster for a pre 70 AD compilation of the gospels is that the death of Peter and Paul are omitted in Luke’s book of the Acts. I have already given reasons why this is an inadequate argument. You have given potential reasons why Paul’s death is omitted, a HYPOTHESIS (very weak) invented to defend a priori assumption that Gospels were written after 70 AD. But this is turning everything upside down. Meanwhile Acts end this way (28:30 31, NIV): For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him. He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance! See? Those words would have been extremely bizarre, had they been written after Paul’s death, a fact well known to the readers of Acts. That’s why the so called New Testament scholars produce impressively sophisticated “justifications” why author of Acts decided to put an end here (a sufficiently capable idiot may produce extremely complicated and advanced justifications for pure absurds to sound “wise”). I don’t claim that dating Acts to 62 AD is absolute yet given this passage, it is a very solid evidence. It is a normal practice to date ancient text by looking for known facts which are mentioned there, and which are not mentioned there, giving chronological boundaries. And there are more arguments to support pre 70 dating of the Gospels (although not as strong). For example, only John, writing after Peter’s death mentions that he was the the disciple that cut High Priest servant’s ear which suggest that the Synoptics omitted this to protect (still alive) Peter. Cannot see how you can call the Parousia a pseudo theory. If everything was going to come to an early end, there would seem to be little point in leaving any kind of early record for any posterity. Clearly when the Parousia did not happen as expected, this perception changed. Yes, this is pseudo theory. Nonsense invented to justify claimed non existence of Gospels before 70. First of all the Gospels were not written merely for posterity, but contrary, as a written record for contemporaries. Secondly: The apocalyptic believes of any group are no reason at all for this group to abstain from writing down (and propagating in a written form) their views. This is just pure nonsense invented by some wise guys, completely detached from the every day experience (see for example Jehovah’s Witnesses and their production of literature). Matthew’s “prophecy” of the destruction of the temple seems to already have occurred. The “abomination of desolation” is a phrase adopted from Daniel which refers to Antiochus Epiphanes erecting a statue of Zeus Olympus there, and is equated with a similar subsequent desecration of the temple by the Romans, which seems to have already occurred. There is nothing in the New Testament that this has already occured. The Jesus’ eschatological speach is strongly derived (almost copycat) from Daniel, who predicts destruction of the Temple: Dn 9:26 NIV After the sixty two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. Of course the Anointed One (and the Son of Man), according to Jesus is Himself. He will be put to death, and after that, the Temple will be razed down, as Daniel prophesized. And that’s all. As this eventually happened, modern so called scholars claim that this was prophecy ex eventu. Disregarding Daniel completely (because it is inconvenient for them). But this purely ideological stance. I suggest that the literate character of your modern western experience blinds you to the strength of oral traditions in pre literate societies, which traditions and pericopes formed the basis of the original gospel sources. But this was not pre literate society, contrary this was relatively highly literate society, and the message could have been put to write almost immediately. No obstacles there. The consensus of all main stream New Testament scholars is that the gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were all written at some time after 70 AD. The consensus… the worthless consensus, based not on the hard data, but on the authority of the scholarship “priests” and intimidation (if you support dating before 70 AD then you are not a scientisct but religious fanatic). I recommend you one thing: read some scholarly works on the New Testament, then read some apologetic works (without a priori prejudice for neither group), compare their arguments and decide which are more rational and make more common sense..","date":"2015-04-21","mins":"6:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"id":"comment-51818","author":"o_k","post":"Louis, it was discussed here: https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/23/the eucharistic miracle of buenos aires/#comments and perhaps in a few other places..","date":"2013-11-17","mins":"6:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/17/barrie-schwortz-on-ewtn-recently/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz on EWTN Recently"},{"id":"comment-51825","author":"o_k","post":"Not one single world of this is true.

The Jehohanan example illustrates not the difficulty, but possibility of nailing through the heel.

This could only have been the patibulum, maybe about the size of a timber rail road sleeper. This is feasible for your average rail road man. The complete cross with upright would be far too heavy to be feasible for him to carry. It implies that the upright (stipes) was already in position securely in the ground. If it wasn’t already in the ground, but joined to the patibulum at the site, and the crucifarius nailed hands and feet while lying down, this is far too much work for the execution party to lift the body and cross complete into the hole, and is inefficient. This is another myth, challenged in recent times. New studies suggest the whole cross was actually carried, not just transverse beam, see http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Glori Web.pdf The Andrè Marion’s comparison of the blood marks on the Tunic of Argenteui and the Shroud, suggest not only the two objects belonged to the same person, but also that this person carried the whole cross. As to the weight of the cross, we know with a high probability its original dimensions. The cross was slotted into a hole a stone ring (11.5 cm in diameter) serving for that purpose was found in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1986, see Witnesses of Mystery pg. 310 313. It is estimated the cross was no higher than say, 250 cm. The Good Theft Patibulum, currently in Rome’s Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (see Thiede&Ancona The Quest for The True Cross and Pierluigi Baima Bollone Sindone, 101 domande e risposte) is 178 (but originally it was probably longer, say 200 cm) x13 x 13cm.

No evidence this hypothesis is correct, or the effect significant so we have no reason to assume so. As such, any dating made of them using their chemical or physical degradation would almost certainly arrive at a date considerably older – perhaps a thousand or more years older – than when the cloth they derived from was actually made. Remember, Fanti used three distinct methods of dating and results of all of them were on behalf of the 1st millenium BC/1st AD.

Comments? Of course I have read this paper. Multiple times, word by word, when I was writing my article about the relics of the Crist’s burial cloths http://ok.apologetyka.info/ateizm/ile byo pocien pogrzebowych jezusa cz1,749.htm And I found several weak points in it. Scavone writes: Chifflet, convinced that the original shroud was consumed in the St Étienne fire, wrote that in 1377 it was miraculously rediscovered in a niche in the restored cathedral.[…] Now we can demonstrate that there really was a copy of the true Shroud painted by an artist. It was most likely commissioned by Jeanne, now the lady of Lirey, and sent in 1377 as a replacement for the one she had taken out of Besançon between 1349 and 1354. Between approx. 1357, when TS was first displayed in Lirey and 1377 there is a 20 years gap! Although the Shroud of Besancon could have been “discovered” much earlier, as the cathedral was rebuilt by 1377. Scavone next writes: The next episode seems to be a patent and deliberate conspiratorial contrivance. However, instead of destroying the Besançon hypothesis, it rather strengthens it. Chifflet wrote that in 1377 the cloth in its chest was rediscovered by means of a strange light coming from a hidden part of the cathedral. (Remember, it was almost certainly that which was made by the artist in Lirey as claimed by d’Arcis.) Judging from the lapse of twenty eight years (1349 1377) between the fire and “rediscovery”, there could not have been many in Besançon who knew precisely what the original had looked like. In 1377 Archbishop Guillaume III de Vergy (1371 1391) was the fifth in line since the fire. That is to say, four archbishops, who might have been able to compare the replacement cloth with the original, had died. In order to determine if it was the same true burial shroud of Christ previously lost, Chifflet relates that the cloth newly found in 1377 was placed upon a corpse, which miraculously revived. It was thus a Vergy who “verified” by a “miracle” that the new Besançon replacement shroud was indeed the original Besançon shroud. A family cover up to exonerate Jeanne’s departure with the true Shroud is a strong possibility. I dislike it. It is too much conspirational. Similar arguments were used by Leonardo proponents, that the Shroud of Lirey and the current Shroud of Turin were two distinct objects. Anyway, there is still 20 years gap between first displays in Lirey and 1377! This makes the Scavone’s reasoning very unlikely. And another point. Here is the branch of genealogy tree coming down from Otto de la Roche to Jeanne de Vergy: Otto de la Roche >Otto II >Isabel/Elisabeth married Jean de Vergy >Guillaume de Vergy > Jeanne de Vergy. Thus it seems that the Shroud had to been inherited by female heirs TWICE. Not impossible, but EXTREMELY UNLIKELY as both Isabel de Ray and Jeanne de Vergy had brothers. We have no guarantee that by the year 1300 the Shroud was still in the hands of Roche/Ray and/or Vergy or any other related families.

The maximum range for imaging is in my opinion (based on analysis of distances of my facial features), as well as Vignon’s no more than 1 2 cm (Jackson & Jumper 3.7 cm is clealry untenable). Based on 3 D plot we see that the metacarpal gaps have a greyscale intensity of ~ 90 100 (they are white), while metacarpals, and fingers are about 150 160 (green yellow).

My current take of it: it is a forgery and should be analyzed with that hypothesis in mind. It does not say the Otto had the Shroud, true. But this is not a problem, as I have a hypothesis that in 1205 Otto wasn’t the owner of the Shroud yet.

First, this is another issue, irrelevant here. Between Othon and Geoffrey de Charny, the Shroud could pass through many hands during those 150 years gap.We don’t know many fascinating stories that could have happened then. I think that you are thinking that the coffer was at that castle since a long time ago (15 17th century). There is essentially no proof of that, and everything looks like it is a recent modern addition of that coffer shown to the visitors to the castle. From Piana (pg. 2): “Behind these objects there is a wooden coffer with a label, put on it in the twentieth century, on which there is written: 13th century coffer in which was preserved in Ray Castle the Shroud of Christ brought by Otho de Ray from Constantinople. 1206. […] Examining the coffer we can see that the cut is characteristic of the second half of fourteenth century. Actually we know that the only original part of it is the bottom [24].” So most of the coffer is actually a reconstruction, but this is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that this coffer was considered the one used to transport some Shroud by Otho. The label apparently must have been placed there in agreement with the castle owners, descendants of the Ray family. I don’t see if they had any interest in faking that tradition. T is conceivable that it is one of the owner of the Ray castle who probably started to believe in the story of T1 and guessed that this could be the coffer used. Haven’t you considered the opposite way? That the author of T1 actually obtained the info about Otto from his descendants living in Ray Castle, and then manipulated some sources to provide “documentation”? It is also conceivable scenario. The castle actually is about 40 km away from Besancon, that’s relatively far for pre automobile society, a day or two walk from the city. It is possible that the story of Otto was unknown at Besancon at that time, when the city boasted possession of alleged Shroud. On the other hand, the Shroud going through the Sainte Chapelle have none of these difficulties with extremely reliable documents: inventories of the Sainte Chapelle having a strong pedigree. And strongly reliable historical events (the transfer of the relics from Constantinople). It is a world apart from such scenario as Othon de la Roche. Yeah. So where are documents ascertaining us that the Shroud (not alleged Mandylion) was actually in Sainte Chapelle? Besides one thing can be sure: had the French King been aware ownership of the Shroud, he would never let it go out of his hands. This is nonsense. As for T3, it shows up recently (1981). That is what I meant about T3 being much later than T1. So, it appears suspect considering that T1 is a made up story. What is the age of this copy (letter to Innocent III)? We do not know. It could be modern. A close study of it should be done. No, Mario. The document itself is much older. It was once a part of so called Chartularium Culisanense codex from Palermo, a codex of document of Saint Sophia Order, associated with Sicilian de Angelis family. The Chartularium itself was lost during WWII, but there was a 18th century transcript of some documents (including the letter to Innocent III), testified in 1859 by Benedetto d’Acquisto, arcibishop of Montreal, and former abbot at Monte Casino, considered distinguished humanist. The document is spurious, and as a copy, it is likely interpolated. But that’s not so important, as the info it contains about sacred linen in Athens in 1205. This is consistent with Otto theory.

Which two forgeries are you referring to? The MS 826 is not a forgery. It is written by a completely incompetent historian. The letter to innocent III: it needs to be analyzed more deeply and dated. But the existence of T1 which makes up the story about Othon is enough to put major doubts in that story. The claim that Othon possessed the Shroud (no matter which) is one alleged forgery. The tradition about that coffer, if false is a second forgery. The letter to Innocent III, claiming the presence of the Shroud in Athens 1205 AD, is the third alleged forgery. In short, there are two possible options: A) Either Othon did not have the Shroud, and then all T1, T2, and T3 are fakes. This is the case if the Shroud was still in Constantinople up to 1241, as Sainte Chapelle theory assumes. B) Or he had the Shroud in possession. Then all T1, T2, and T3 essentially say the truth about that, even if they have several issues with other things. What if A)? This means that all (very obscure to general public, and at least T3 is distanced from the two others) T1, T2 and T3 must have been simultaneously faked in order to create false impression (about 200 years after alleged fabrication in case of T1 and T3 at least) that Othon once had the Shroud. Sounds credible? Not to me. Sounds rather like a big conspiracy theory. One coincidence likely an accident. Two coincidences perhaps still an accident. But three? something must be afoot. Of course. This is an explicit point I discuss on the web page about the theory of the Sainte Chapelle: showing that the Mandylion did read the Sainte Chapelle. See http://sindonology.org/sainte chapelle.shtml#ans:mandylion reach. I do not assume that this the Shroud of Turin. See the five clearly separate questions with answers on the web page http://sindonology.org/sainte chapelle.shtml. Search for “Did the reliquary of the Mandylion reach the Sainte Chapelle?”. I have studied this recently. All you have for confirmation that the Shroud (not just the reliquary!) reached Sainte Chapelle is Inventory A, claiming: 11/24. Item ung escrin de fust peint où il y a ung grant sainctuaire sans escript. (A painted box where there is a large holy relic without identification.) All other reliquaries mention just a box, and not what was inside because the box was likley empty I suppose the word “grant” does not describe physical size. And “sans escript” suggest that they didn’t even look inside. Had the Shroud been there, it certainly wouldn’t have passed unnoticed. I suppose the box did indeed contained the Shroud, but by 1241 was already empty. Compare this with the letter of Theodore Angelus: https://shroudstory.wordpress.com/about/acheiropoietos jesus images in constantinople the documentary evidence/ Theodore Angelus wishes long life for Innocent [III], Lord and Pope at old Rome, in the name of Michael, Lord of Epirus and in his own name. In April of last year a crusading army, having falsely set out to liberate the Holy Land, instead laid waste the city of Constantine. During the sack, troops of Venice and France looted even the holy sanctuaries. The Venetians partitioned the treasures of gold, silver, and ivory while the French did the same with the relics of the saints and the most sacred of all, the linen in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before the resurrection. We know that the sacred objects are preserved by their predators in Venice, in France, and in other places, the sacred linen in Athens. . . (there are some asks for intervention later) Rome, Kalends of August, 1205. (my boldings) The Shroud was elsewhere at that time. Just an empty casket remained. And who stole the cloth. There is one suspect already… (and he is not Othon). In Constantinople there might have been other cloths used in Jesus’ tomb (or claimed to be), but only one had an image: what Robert the Clari saw, which is conceivably the Mandylion. Yes. But the fact that there were at least three alleged burial cloths in Constantinople is essential to answer objections of those who claim that Mandylion couldn’t have been a burial cloth, as those are listed separately in various inventories of Constantinople’s relics.

So, your claim that they were done simultaneously is a major assumption on your part. No – I don’t assume they were done simultaneously (if letter of Theodore Angelus is genuinely from 1205, at least in most part, I can’t). The only think I assume is that they (at least either T1 or T2 and T3) were done independently. Which is likely given 1000 miles distance between Palermo and Besancon. Essential question, which you are avoiding to answer: Do you believe in two corresponding forgeries in two obscure documents from about 18th century 1000 miles away from each other? As for the Mandylion, you forgot the most important element: the Golden Bull of Baudoin II. It states that a cloth was in the reliquary. That document was written in 1247, six years after the reliquary of the Mandylion was received in Paris, and given directly by Baudoin II to Louis IX and the clerics. They would not have verified what that document says compared to what they had? Very unlikely. The golden bull says only about sanctam toellam, tabulae insertam and provides no details. Very unlikely had they known the Shroud of Turin was there inside. And so with the word “toile”. Besides you have written yourself (http://www.sindonology.org/sainte chapelle.shtml#ans:clerics notice ): “It is indeed surprising that if there was a large cloth in the reliquary of the Mandylion, and that it bears a complete body image of a man, that the clerics would not have noticed it. However, the inventories of the Sainte Chapelle gives numerous clues that the clerics barely analyzed the relics beyond their direct observations inside their reliquaries and without manipulating the relics. For example, the authorities in charge of the inventory A did not try to identify more precisely the nature of the relic for item eleven because they wrote “sans identification” (with no identification). This detail shows that the clerics in charge of safeguarding the relics, at the Sainte Chapelle, not only did not know the real nature of that relic but that they were not in charge to find out. This lack of curiosity is surprising for us today, but the clerics did not have the task to deeply analyze the relics, and certainly not in a position to determine their authenticity. Their duty was to safeguard the relics, so that none would be damaged, desecrated or stolen. When inventories were done, they describe what they could see without modifying the reliquaries and the relics. […] This lack of analysis of the relics from the clerics explains the surprising observation that if the Shroud had been folded in that reliquary in the Grande Châsse of the Sainte Chapelle, and inside a trellis attached at the bottom of the reliquary, it is possible that the clerics never analyzed more carefully the relic by detaching the trellis from the bottom of the reliquary, removing the Shroud from the trellis, and unfolding it to see the complete body image.” You are now contradicting yourself. Half seriously, you start manipulating like a professional historian ;) It is equally possible that the reliquary was already empty (since 1204) when sent to Louis IX and no one checked what’s inside, merely accepting the word that it was used previously to hold some great cloth. This is better explanation for all the facts and documents known (including T1, T2, and T3). And it inconceivable that had any King of France been aware his ownership of the Shroud of Turin, he would give it to a mere vassal like Geoffrey de Charny.

They stated that Othon, after appropriating of the Shroud, would have gifted it to the Besançon cathedral just in that year [40].” I know, Mario. Besides it is this paper https://www.academia.edu/3663742/Piana Valencia 2012 , not the previous (from ENEA 2010) I quoted. Piana adds: “Besides Perreciot adds that Othon would have sent the Shroud to his father who, in 1206, gifted it. Clash with this belief is the fact that, as described below, Pons de La Roche died in 1203. It is therefore impossible that he received the Shroud in 1206. Moreover, it is unlikely that de La Roche family deprived itself of a relic stolen in Constantinople, gifting it to the local Church. In this way they would have proven the ownership of a relic, that was a punishable fact. All these things make this hypothesis unreliable and thus suggest that the Shroud could have reached Ray sur Saône castle after 1206.” So, if you use this paper as a reference, it would mean that the identification of the coffer would be based on the MS 826, which is fanciful. The coffer would have no basis according to that statement. Non sequitur, Mario. There is nowhere said that the identification of that particular coffer, as used to carry the Shroud, is based on MS 826 (or any other document). The precise date (1206) on the 20th century label is based on this theory, but this is irrelevant (as all other unreliable details). The point is that there is a claim that some coffer was used to carry the Shroud by Otto. This claim can be true or false basing on mere coffer and lack of documents we don’t know but combining this information with other documents (t1 and T3) we can make a good case for the claim that Otto had once some shroud stolen from Constantinople (and for nothing else)..","date":"2015-11-04","mins":"1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/27/its-the-curmudgeon-in-me/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"It’s the Curmudgeon in Me"},{"id":"comment-213857","author":"o_k","post":"Ps.

Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf There is in the same glorious city, the face of our Lord Jesus Christ on a linen cloth, made by Jesus himself in the following way, as the Greeks say. The above mentioned King Abgar was in the city burning with a great desire to see the beautiful face of our Lord. Jesus knew of the king’s desire and so took a linen cloth and wrapped his face in it—the form and figure of his face was imprinted on to the cloth. The Saviour thus sent his face to King Abgar on the linen cloth, so that he might see what he looked like. This wonderful linen cloth with the face of the Lord Jesus, marked by direct contact, is kept with greater veneration than the other relics in the palace, and held in such esteem that it is always kept in a golden case and very carefully locked up. And when all the other palace relics are shown to the faithful at certain times, this linen cloth on which the face of our redeemer is depicted is not shown to anyone and is not opened up for anyone except the emperor of Constantinople. The case that stored the holy object used to be kept open once, but the whole city was struck by continuous earthquakes, and everyone was threatened with death. A heavenly vision revealed that the city would not be freed of such ill until such time as the linen cloth with the Lord’s face on it should be locked up and hidden away, far from human eyes. And so it was done. The sacred linen cloth was locked away in a golden case and carefully sealed up, and then the earthquake stopped and the heaven sent ills ceased. From that time on nobody has dared to open the case or to see what might be inside it, as everyone believes and fears that if anyone tries to open it the whole city will be struck by another earthquake. The reference of King Abgar clearly provides link to the Mandylion. And as to earthquakes convenient excuse for keeping the Mandylion closed, and keep its true nature a secret….

And who’s to say exactly oposite, that centuries of ageing have not deteriorated the final image in a purely aesthetic sense, with softer tonal contrasts etc? Tonal contrasts are scalable, and I hardly believe they changed through centuries. The image has faded perhaps, or rather linen has darkened, but tonal contrast in case of bas relief are rather 0 1, either it was in the contact with the cloth, or no. So all the techniques in general using bas reliefs would have problems with smooth grayscale. Colinsberry : The first priority was to show that a 3 D enhancible negative Shroud image can/could be produced in principle, ie. That there are no insurmountable scientific obstacles.

Well, I think I’ve must have seen very nearly every crucifix, shroud and dead Jesus painted or sculpted between 0 AD and 1700 AD, every naked, or crossed handed, or flogged, nailed, thorn crowned or speared body, within the Byzantine or Romanesque traditions of overtall thin people with long thin fingers, in psalters, altar frontals, statues, brass rubbings and images of every kind, and am not persuaded that these art historians are correct. I don’t think the shroud derives from an artistic culture. Mind you, I’m not convinced that an artistic culture derives from the shroud either, so maybe that cuts both ways. There are guys like Schafersman and Nickel who like to look for characteristics of Gothic style in the Shroud. And they can find it, I don’t argue. The problem is that they can find characteristics of Romanese, Reneissance, Baroque, Classicism and Art Deco styles, as well as many discrepancies with any of those styles in Shroud. But of course for them the Shroud is medieval forgery so it must be Gothic. The relationship between the Shroud and Christian art for me are quite obvious, and undisputable (and no matter what the art historians who are completely unfamiliar with the Shroud think, if they had overlooked such basic correspondence how one can call them true experts?), even, if not always direct. The problem is what influenced what, whether the Shroud influenced art, or the art influenced the Shroud?

Contrary to UFO, the Shroud is a real object, (according to Wikipedia) bearing the image of a man who appears to have suffered physical trauma in a manner consistent with crucifixion. Many believe this man pictured on this cloth is a Jesus Christ, and perhaps they have some reasons to believe so. If you Nicola, were one of them, how would you argue that the Shroud is authentic, (even if you don’t believe it)? What points can be presented in support of this view? I don’t think none. But first I can tell you one weak point of pro authenticity arguments. According to Robert de Clari, he saw in Constantinople a burial shroud with a picture of Christ on it. There is no textual evidence that this cloth was actually the Shroud of Turin (like “shroudies’ usually assume), and not the pseudo Shroud of Besancon for example.

That points to a clear fact: the Mandylion is totally unknown from the Latins in the 13th century Haven’t you considered the fact that when the reliquary reached Paris about 1241, it was already empty? Emptied in 1204. That’s why the clerics actually knew nothing about what was stored inside before.

Contrary, the Shroud face looks realistic watching it you have (I think correct) impression you look at the real human face. Of course, in the 3 D view it can be distorted in many ways, as 3 D representation of the Shroud man is not the 100 % accurate representation of the 3 D form that was once within the Shroud. To avoid misunderstanding, there are two things important here. First, the fact that the 3rd dimension (Z axis ) is referenced not to some arbitrary plane parallel tothe XY axis, but to the surface of the Shroud, which (although being flat surface as well) wrapped somehow the body. For the second: scale factor place important role here. As it is a little bit arbitrary, the Z axis will be usually rescaled compared to objective XY scale which adds additional visual distortions. It needs a little bit practice to accurately perceive the 3 D representations of the body of Shroud Man and then to compare it with artificial copies.

You know obviously that the Shroud is not a painting, for several reasons; no significant amount of paint, negative character, 3 D properties, extreme superficiality, no fiber cementation, no directionality, isotropic Fourier characteristics, etc, etc. We have discussed those issues many times. We know that STURP found no evidence for the Shroud being a painting, we have also excelllent Isabel Piczek presentation on the topic: http://www.shroud.com/piczek.htm and so on. So you know obviously that Charles’ thesis is a nonsense and so do Daveb, Mario, anoxie, Mike, Max, Thomas, Thibault, Yannick, everyone with some knowledge on the Shroud. And nevertheless we have pretend that we treat those absurd claims of Charles seriously. Isn’t it a little bit kidding? Of course it is well known to us that they have virtually no basis, and I don’t suspect that even Charles himself really believes they have. It seems he plays with us, challenging us on his terms to convince him he is wrong. What’s worse, although obviously bogus, this article was published in, as Charles claims, a “serious historical journal”, thus providing wrong perception of the Shroud to the readers. And what sounds even more cynical, Charles not only has knowingly (and probably intentional) published misleading, agenda driven article, but also has received money for that. Is that really fair? How not get irritated by all of these issues? Shouldn’t someone rather say openly that Charles is delliberately deceiving people?

Just a few of the examples from the Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relic#History One of the earliest sources that purports to show the efficacy of relics is found in 2 Kings 13:20–21: 20 Elisha died and was buried. Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring. 21 Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came to life and stood up on his feet. (NIV) Also cited is the veneration of Polycarp’s relics recorded in the Martyrdom of Polycarp (written 150–160 AD).[13] With regard to relics that are objects, an often cited passage is Acts 19:11–12, which says that Paul’s handkerchiefs were imbued by God with healing power. Charles (further): It needs a particular mind set to preserve relics which is why they are not part of many Christian traditions. Yes especially those Protestant traditions that originated 1500 years afterwards, and possesed no relics, and no previous traditions at all (thus they adopted sola scriptura principle). I can’t recall any pre Reformation Church that doctrinally rejected veneration and prservation of relics by principle, even despite critical voices about cult or provenace of some relics raised from time to time. Hugh: Can you fill out a bit of chronology for us, Charles. I understand there was a huge expansion in relic collecting from about 300 AD, presumably mostly in the East? I don’t think there was a great expansion in relic collecting about 300 AD, except for the Saint Helen and her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where she rediscovered True Cross, and gathered many other relics. Simply since the Constantine, and the end of persecution, most of the relics (like Crown of Thorns for example) didn’t have to be hidden, and could be publically venerated. Before that time they were mostly kept in the judeo christian society, and passed from generation to generation, in rather secretive way. Do any other allegedly 1st century relics appear later than 1350? Yes or rather they reappear after several centuries. For example: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/06/120618 john the baptist bones jesus christ bible bulgaria science higham/ Purported skeletal remains of John the Baptist have been dated to the first century A.D. And so could conceivably have belonged to the “forerunner of Christ,” who baptized Jesus, scientists say. Discovered in 2010 among the ruins of a Bulgarian church, the remains include six human bones: a knucklebone from the right hand, a tooth, part of a cranium, a rib, and an ulna, or forearm bone. DNA and radiocarbon testing of collagen from the knucklebone show that the remains likely belonged to a Middle Eastern man who lived in the first century A.D., which fits with the story of John the Baptist.

If you have any orientation in ancient history (especially the number and condition f preserved written sources and historiography) you will know that is one should expect. There were little written records of relic cult before 300 AD, yet there were a few, showing us that the relics were in fact venerated, although not openly like after Constantine. Besides people who took care about them rarely left written records. Writing history besides was rather Greek and Roman (and on the other side of the world Chinese) hobby. 90 % of historical Jewish writings comes from two sources: the Bible and Josephus (who wrote in Hellenic manner). There are no preserverved historical writings from Persians for example , up to the Arab conquests. There are no Persian, or Parthian Herodotus nor Livy, nor Sima Qian. The same is for Indinas, there are only a couple of historical writings in India before. 1200 AD. So the lack of records is fully understndable. When did all the Crowns of Thorns and Tunics, Lances, Nails, Swaddling Clothes and stuff appear in Western Europe? Wasn’t it earlier? The main periods of major transfer of relics from the East to the West are 1.) The Persian conquest of the Holy land in 614 when several relics were trnasferred to Spain 2.) The Charlemagne times circa 800 AD, 3.) The outcome of the 4th Crusade, when several relics were looted, or sold to the West. Of course diplomatic relations brought several pieces of relics (a few thorns for example) to the West at different times.

Maybe. But I strongly disagree. In this case, however, they should measure the image of the Mask of Agamemnon, both in the original paper and above, when they will find that the mask has been considerably narrowed from what it was in the paper! Here you have a screenshot of the previous comment: How can I convince you that the Shroud face is indeed the mask of Agamemnon effect? I order to reconcile these problems we must remember that the Shroud is, of course, flat, but the mask of Agamamnon, although its ears have been squashed outwards, is not at all flat, but maintains its original “face profile” rather well. And fine! Of course neither the mask is completely flattenen, nor the Shroud was tighly pressed to the face (rather loosely draped, see blue line on Slide 6). The sides of the nose, for example, would be dark, but this is not what is observed on the Shroud. Quite contrary, if you look at the Shroud carefully. OK actually says of his 4 diagrams of possible transmission that “all 4 ways give similar results.” Slide 7: “Generally, as first approximation, all 4 ways give similar results, but there may be subtle differences between them.” So, how can he be so dogmatic that “the transmission certainly wasn’t vertical”? So, apart from the ears, the flat Shroud neatly reproduces the curved face of Agamemnon. This is not evidence for any kind of drape, but rather for the vertical radiation hypothesis OK rejects. Exactly opposite: it disproves vertical projection. Use your imagination and guess where hair should be roughly in the ears area, on the sides of the head. Compare it with the mask of Agamemnon and Lavoie’s diagrams (slide 23). See the position of bloodstains.

Hugh, read carefully those two papers: Ercoline, W.R., R.C. Downs, Jr. And J.P. Jackson, “Examination of the Turin Shroud for Image Distorions,” IEEE 1982 Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society, October 1982, pp. 576 579 and Mario Latendresse’s „Evidence that the Shroud was not Completely Flat during the Image Formation” from the 2005 3rd International Dallas Conference The results there are similar to the increase you calculated.

The shape of the linen draped around the head is similar to the one presented as blue line on Slides 6 & 9 of Part 3 of my presentation, and also similar to the Fig. 7 & 8 in Ercoline et al., and Fig. 4 & 5 in Mario’s paper. With the notable difference that the linen is in contact with sides of the head (see Slide 24 in my Part 3).

The image gets progressively wider and wider in proportion to its height, as specified. You are very welcome to check this for yourself; after all, its your paper. The progressive distortion, which incidentally fits your hypothesis of a loosely draped cloth, may be an inadvertent artefact of the pdf, but it cannot be denied that it is there. The aspect of different pictures may change slightly from slide to slide, as they were put there in a way to include as many of them on individual slides, as necessary. But this is irrelevant, as just the original images, before insertion into presentation, count. Here you have original images from Slide 23. There are only two actually:Firstly, can we ignore the ludicrous dimensions you quote? The Mask of Agamemnon is life size, not a few millimetres in each direction, and it is roughly as wide as it is high. The reproduction in Valladolid is 25cm x 28cm, and one in New York is 26cm x 25cm. I have noticed this. The quoted 17 cm must be then probably cheek to cheek width. But this is similar to the Shroud. Anyway, what’s important, is the Lavoie’s diagram on the left of Slide 23. See the position of bloodstains apparently in the hair. Then look on the comparison with Agamemnon mask on the right. Check where the hair should be, if the Shroud shows similar flattening of a 3 D object. Then you can easily understand that the projection cannot be exactly vertical. However, the most important dimension is not the height or width, but the third. If the mask was laid flat on a table, how high would the nose be above the table surface? The Met Museum copy gives this as 7cm. Cyrano de Bergerac? The actual nose protrusion rather doesn’t exceed about 3 cm. It is most likely because the Mask is not fully flat. A cloth pulled tightly over the mask, in a straight line from ear to nose to ear would be three or four centimetres wider than the mask, and if it was loosely draped it would be even wider. If the Shroud does indeed exactly match the width of the Mask (or of a theoretical body), then it cannot have been draped over it. It must have been more or less horizontal, and the image therefore projected vertically. Nonsense. Just look at Lavoie’s figures: they show the linen actually draped over the body. And as to frontal face distortions check Mario’s paper: https://www.academia.edu/9063899/The Turin Shroud Was Not Flattened Before the Images Formed and no Major Image Distortions Necessarily Occur from a Real Body http://www.sindonology.org/papers/latendresse2005a Slides.pdf or as, a last resort: tape measure, life volunteer & Shroud Scope.

Because the two papers compare measurements of different face areas. For Ercoline they are: I “width of the face at hair/face intersections a long horizontal level through the center of eyebrows” and J “width of the face at bone structure at edges of eye sockets”, where distortions should be relatively modest. On the contrary: Mario measures the width of the face at line going through the tip of the nose, where distortions should have been maximal. I don’t see inconsistency between the two. Therefore the Shroud could not have been formed by a ‘shortest path’ mechanism, and something more like a vertical mechanism would fit the measurements better. Both Latendresse and Ercoline make this explicit. Mario in Section 2.1 of his paper: “On the other hand, we conjecture that the projection direction and value (its “force”) is probably due to only one rule: the distance attenuation of the projection. That is, every point of the body might be projected by following the shortest path to reach the sheet. That would be a simpler rule unifying the direction and force of the projection. This projection would be perpendicular to the skin or sheet in some cases – for example when the sheet and body surface are flat and parallel. On some other configurations, it would not be perpendicular neither to the skin nor to the body surface. It is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze this conjecture.” and in Conclusions: “We have also conjectured that the mechanism of projection is probably neither normal to the skin, nor to the sheet, and not really perpendicular to gravity, but is probably following the shortest path to the sheet.” Ercoline et al. Do not consider the shortest path projection. As far as I know you are alone in maintaining that the vertical transmission hypothesis is impossible on measurement grounds alone Yes. But that is how it looks like to make new discoveries. Even maintaining a great respect, we must go beyond what Ercoline, Downs, Jackson and Mario accomplished. Even though it apparently looks like, the projection of body on the Shroud isn’t actually vertical. Hugh, if instead of inventing 1000 reasons to undermine my conclusions, you will repeat my reasoning yourself, and check all the premises mentioned (bloodmarks position determined by Lavoie, face distortions measured by Mario & Ercoline, the Agamemnon mask effect, the trick of bandings modulation of the sides of the face, and manage to imagine how the shortest path projection looks like), you will realise that..","date":"2015-10-19","mins":"4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"id":"comment-212937","author":"o_k","post":"Hugh: Check Mario measurements from Slides 16 17 (Shroud) of his presentation and the Slide 21.

You don’t. It’s a matter of opinion. It is not a matter of opinion, definitely! Ercoline, Downs & Jackson correctly observed that for the frontal face area (and most of the rest of the body), the vertical projection is the most consistent with observed distortion profile, in comparison with two alternative hypotheses (projection perpendicular to the body or the cloth). But they missed something. They missed the possibility of other ways of projection, for example the projection through the shortest path between the body and cloth (see Part 3 of my presentation, Slide 7, figure 4). This is also the way of projection indicated by Mario: See how it works: In the front face area it is close to vertical mapping. But this is not the case for sides! where it is more perpendicular to the body (similar to contact process).

In some places there are large fragments, as at the Holy Chapel in Paris, at Poitiers, and at Rome, where a good sized crucifix is said to have been made of it. In brief, if all the pieces that could be found were collected together, they would make a big ship load. Yet the Gospel testifies that a single man was able to carry it.” — Calvin, Traité Des Reliques. Conflicting with this is the finding of Charles Rohault de Fleury, who, in his Mémoire sur les instruments de la Passion 1870 made a study of the relics in reference to the criticisms of Calvin and Erasmus. He drew up a catalogue of all known relics of the True Cross showing that, in spite of what various authors have claimed, the fragments of the Cross brought together again would not reach one third that of a cross which has been supposed to have been three or four metres in height, with transverse branch of two metres wide, proportions not at all abnormal. He calculated: supposing the Cross to have been of pine wood (based on his microscopic analysis of the fragments) and giving it a weight of about seventy five kilogrammes, we find the original volume of the cross to be 0.178 cubic metres (6.286 cubic feet).

There is a very comprehensive article on Wikipedia, but Helena’s dispersal of the Cross seems ambiguous and is not clearly stated: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True Cross Hesemann claims so, but truly, one must check within primary sources. Anyway it is probable, and some fragments are indeed in Rome. One half of the Titulus was left in Jerusalem, one traveled to Rome. So the cross probably shared similar fate. Daveb of wellington nz : The Wiki article indicates that part of the Vera Crux was broken up to be dispersed throughout Christendom as relics. It would seem that the portion Helena left in Jerusalem was substantial, and it was this portion that was often carried by the Crusaders into battle and later captured by Saladin. Is it possible that the relic now discovered in Turkey is the remains of Saladin’s trophy? According to Hesemann what was left from it up to crusades was not so substantial. The patriarch of Jerusalem partitioned it in 638, after muslim conquest, into 19 pieces, from which: 3 were sent to Constantinople, 2 to Cyprus, 3 to Antioch, 2 to Georgia, 1 to Crete, Edessa, Alexandria, Ascalon, and Damascus, respectively, and 4 remained in Jerusalem, of which the largest part was later carried into battle by crusaders. About recent discovery, it was not the Saldin’s prize. In the news report was said that the excavated church in Turkey is 1350 years old.

Others from the head area, the largest of which “was about 16 cm. In size,” were of plant origin, probably flax.

The pattern of the stains and the missing areas creates a mirror image, indicating that the textile had been folded twice in antiquity, forming a four layered wrapping, in which the body of the deceased was placed. The four layers were then sewn together, “as is evident from rows of small holes in each layer” [12]. One might think from size of the cloth that it had been assembled from several pieces. However, it was designed and manufactured as a single sheet. The edges were decorated by bands of a more elaborate weave, incorporating brown and black threads.

The weavers of the Turin Shroud found the time machine of H.G. Wells and went back six millenniums to bring the cloth of a warrior chief.

You won’t be content until someone finds 1st century 4×1 meter size linen herringbone 3:1 Z spun cloth from the 1st century Palestine. Until then you will always be complaining that “archeological record disproves authenticity of the Shroud of Turin”. But your demands are obviously vritualy impossible to satisfy in practice, not because such cloths didn’t exist, but because there were very rare. Everyone agrees that the Shroud is unique, one of its kind. In either ancient and medieval times there is no second like that. But it shows nothing. All elements (Z spun, 3:1, linen, size etc.) were possible to perform in antiquity, and the cloth could have been used in 1st century Palestine. “The only parallel with the Turin Shroud textile is a piece of cloth kept in the Victoria & Albert Museum, in London, and it is medieval”.

So the cloth is different, and Tyrer concludes it cannot be parallel to the Shroud. What Lombatti and you do , is not valid argumentation but simply a primitve sociotechnique. You are applying double standards. The cloths from Palmyria, Masada, Akeldama etc. Have some similarities with the Shroud, as well as diferences. And so medival cloths like those from V&A. The point for pro authenticty is to show that the presence of the Shroud in 1st century Palestine was possible from technical and historical point of view. So they point to the similar features in other cloths of that period (even if other features were different), proving that the Shroud was technically possible to be produced in that period. On the contrary, the sceptics use double standards. No other cloth, whether ancient or medieval is identical to the Shroud. But when talking about ancient cloths, sceptics underline differences, while talking about medieval they stress similarities with the Shroud. This is clearly a manipulation.

These sects are three: – The first is that of the Pharisees, the second that Sadducees, and the third that of the Essens, as we have frequently told you; for I thought that by this means I might choose the best, if I were once acquainted with them all; so I contented myself with hard fare, and underwent great difficulties, and went through them all. Nor did I content myself with these trials only; but when I was informed that one, whose name was Banus, lived in the desert, and used no other clothing than grew upon trees, and had no other food than what grew of its own accord, and bathed himself in cold water frequently, both by night and by day, in order to preserve his chastity, I imitated him in those things, and continued with him three years. So when I had accomplished my desires, I returned back to the city, being now nineteen years old, and began to conduct myself according to the rules of the sect of the Pharisees, which is of kin to the sect of the Stoics, as the Greeks call them.

Remember, the chapter in Witnesses about Holy Tunic of Argenteuil is in fact only short summary of a book that is my primary source of information about it: André Marion, Gérard Lucotte Le linceul de Turin et la tunique d’Argenteuil A polish edition of it is partailly available at Google Books: http://books.google.pl/books?id=0s9 L Qkw CE Ws C&printsec=frontcover&hl=pl#v=onepage&q&f=false Hugh: It is interesting, is it not, that after vacuuming approximately 10000 cm2 (yes I’m guessing – how big is it?) of the tunic of Argenteuil, 115 pollen grains were found. Marion & Lucotte write that more pollens were found, but approximately 2/3 of them are damaged. 115 were identified under SEM. Collin: As for contamination – calcium carbonate would not not be a problem. All clean up procedures use acid, which would convert the carbon to gaseous CO2. If DDT were a suspected contaminant, then a solvent for lipids is all that is required (DDT being highly hydrophobic and lipid soluble). One could also determine lipid soluble chlorine to get an estimate of maximum contamination. Marion and Lucotte provide details about carbon dating. The first “official” dating at Saclay ordered by Jean Pierre Maurice used two samples gave results 530 650 AD. But another blind dating was ordered using (smaller) part of the same sample with the same pre treatment and cleansing procedure, and gave result 670 880 AD. Marion and Lucotte cliam that test cleansing failed to clear the sample from all calcium carbonate , about 1/3 of initial amount of calcium remained in the threads. The Tunic is heavily contaminated, because in the years 1793 1795, during the French Revolution, it was buried by abbot Ozet in the parish garden to hide it from revolutionaries. So the sense of carbon dating can be seriously questioned..","date":"2013-11-06","mins":"2:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-50237","author":"o_k","post":"Dave, of course I understand what you mean.

In any case, because of the observable ‘banding’ of the weave of the cloth, we know there’s no sign of patching or reweaving in the area. From this: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/whanger.pdf “There is significant variability in the radiodensity of both warp and weft threads in this area. Some of the threads angulate, and the continuity of a few seems to be broken. This area is denser and the 3:1 herringbone weave pattern is much less obvious than in the nearby body of the Shroud fabric.Our conclusion is that the radiographs are strongly suggestive of significant alterations in the threads and weave of the Shroud fabric in the area from which the C14 specimen was taken, thus casting major doubts on the validity of the radiocarbon dating.” I know that Flury Lemberg is currently the most being in touch with the Shroud person in the world and I don’t disregard her opinion. But she is not the single textile expert in the world, and I feel she is trying to defend both Archidiocese, and her colleagues Vial and Testore.

We sent blood flecks to the laboratory devoted to the study of ancient blood at the State University of New York. None of these claims could be confirmed. […] It is almost certain that the blood spots are blood, but no definitive statements can be made about its nature or provenience, i.e., whether it is male and from the Near East. And further about aloe and myrrh: Biblical accounts suggested several types of compounds that might have appeared on the cloth (e.g., aloes, myrrh, sebaceous secretions, etc.). We planned and executed chemical analytical methods that could detect them in 1978. Those methods were extremely sensitive, but they did not detect squalene or myrrh. These results could have been confirmed by additional tests on the Shroud, but the “restoration” has totally changed the Shroud’s surface.

Sadly, it was Frei’s own actions, both during and after the 1978 examination, that led to doubts about his methods and conclusions. The problem is, as I see that in when describing Frei’s efforts in your work, there is too much concentration on how “unproffesional” (in yours, and your STURP coleagues) the behaviour of Frei was. So the most important are complains that his tapes left glue residues on the Shroud, that he caused considerable strain on the cloth etc. Only the negative (in your view) aspects of his work. Well, there are two sides of the medal perhaps he knew what was he doing, and what methods he considered appropriate for his work. One should also remember that he was present during 1973 examination, so contrary to STURP team, he had an experience with the Shroud. There are other aspects with which I disagree. The opinion voiced by you in the interview with Górny regarding 2002 restoration was the point I disliked most. No matter how controversial the restoration was, the accusatory pronouncement, full of (sometimes absurd) charges, verging on the insinuations towards Turin was really disgusting. But I suppose it only reflects the attitude of some American (and not only) researchers, who, when not granted access to the Shroud, were spreading innuendoes towards Turin that for some purpose it wanted to “destroy” the Shroud. And at last well the matter of pareidolia, particularly about the claims of the inscriptions claimed on the Shroud. While certainly being controversial, I think that this problem is too easily dismissed by several Shroud researchers, including you, Barrie. In my opinion, the pareidolia is often used as an easy and convenient excuse to put the matter aside, without giving it the proper and balanced assesment. It is easy to accept and defend information that supports our personal beliefs whether it is credible or not, and ALL of us are susceptible to such errors in judgement. I agree.

How many hard facts are there in Markwardt’s paper? How many hard facts relevant to the Shroud (or any of its previous incarnations)? And how much of the story comes merely from Markwardt’s imagination? I don’t claim that Markwardt’s scenario is impossible. Simply there is no hard enough evidence for this.

Five samples were dated from five different cloths –three of them came up with the expected date, while the cloth from an Egyptian mummy returned a date of any time in the 19th or 20th centuries. The laboratory immediately concluded that the cloth (and the mummy) were fakes. The sample from the Sudarium was dated to around 700 AD. Scientist César Barta spoke about the carbon dating process, emphasising the fact that if carbon dating is always absolutely accurate, then we could just as well finish the congress there and then. However, there were several points to bear in mind – in specialist carbon dating magazines, about half the samples dated come up with the expected date, around 30% with an “acceptable” date, and the other 20% is not what one would expect from archaeology. The laboratory used (via the National Museum in Madrid) said they were surprised by the result and asked if the cloth was contaminated with any oil based product, as oil is not cleaned by the laboratory processes used before carbon dating and if oil is present on a sample, the date produced by carbon dating is in fact the date of contamination. I would like to know more details about the dating of Sudarium. Nevertheless given the correspondences between the Sudarium and the Shroud, and that it seems that they covered the face of the same man, there is a contradiction</B< between 1260 1390 AD dating for the Shroud, and circa 8th century for the Sudarium.

As quoted the comment is bordering on absurd. The ‘typical’ measurements of a Spanish man? Are all Spanish men ‘typical’, or are any Spanish men who are not typical also not Spanish? What are the measurements of a ‘typical’ Jewish man, or a ‘typical’ inuit for that matter. Typical, that means that anthropometric parameters measured on Sudarion of Oviedo are much closer to semitic than Spaniard average. It is not absolute evidence by any means simply another clue, which cannot be simply disregarded. How, after all, can you tell? If the ‘points of congruence’ argument is used to establish that the two cloths are related, you have to start with the premise that there is no relationship, and show that that premise is wrong. If you start by assuming the two cloths are related, then of course you are likely to find the points of congruence more telling than the points of non congruence. The fact that the bloodstains on Sudarium are not just random has been convincingly shown by forensic analysis by Spanish specialists. They described in detail their origin and way in which they were made. They were able to associate those stains with appropraite face features like nose, mouth and forehead. Thus those are not just random stains of spilled blood like in the Rorschasch test, but have their own forensic explanation. Starting with this, the method of counting congruence points with the Shroud absolutely makes sense. First you must check whether there are any characteristics that exclude common origin with the Shroud (there are none). Then you set up your null hypothesis: the both cloths have nothing in common and similar bloodstains on both are result of purely accidental coincidence Then you start looking for PO Cs. The more (non trivial) you find, the more unlikely is your null hypothesis (that the cloths are unrelated). If you can find enough PO Cs you can reject your null hypothesis and accept that the both cloths are related, that means they covered the same face. However, as I said, it is not easy to discuss this without a clearer indication of what, exactly, the 120 or so points of congruence actually are. Is there a diagram of them? Who counted them up? The 120 PO Cs (70 for the fron, 50 for the back) references goes to Whanger and his polarized images overlay technique. Unfortunately I have found no independent confirmation of that. Had I possesed enought resolution Sudarium images, I would try to verify this myself (but unfortunately I don’t have them). Anyway if just a dozen (10 % of Whanger claims) gets confirmed, than this would be enough to confirm direct relation between Sudarium and the Shroud. And although I don’t believe that all PO Cs claimed by Whanger are in fact valid, neither I believe that more than 90 % of them are just the result of his imagination..","date":"2015-02-12","mins":"3:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/12/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-as-evidence/","cat":"sudarium","title":"The Sudarium of Oviedo as Evidence?"},{"id":"comment-190854","author":"o_k","post":"Kelly: Reported with conviction & certainty but scientifically nowhere close to a slam dunk.

So the alternatives scenarios are: 1.) one or both cloths was created to imitate the other in ancient/medieval times when obviously there was neither knowledge nor abilities to create such close imitation, withstanding modern scrutiny. 2.) The two clothes covered two distinct bodies with following features: * Both belonged to crucified men, with beard and mustache. * Both crucified had something resembling Crown of Thorns on their heads. * Both crucified had the same blood type, AB, belonging to the 5 % of of the population, according to the indications of blood type tests. *Both men had their heads banked to the right after their death (there is 50 % chance for such coincidence). * Both men had identical, or at least very similar face features, as indicated by blood patterns on Sudarium. Two distinct men, two distinct corpses, by pure accident having so many common traits! An unbelievable coincidence! Reminder: both clothes are burial cloths. Both were preserved for some reason. And both have been claimed to belong to the very same person: Jesus of Nazareth. So there are even more coincidences (and I even haven’t started counting points of congruences between bloodstains and images on both cloths). Do you really think that Sudarium of Oviedo was just an ordinary bloodied napkin, found somewhere in the dump, and it eventually turned up having so many correspondences with the Shroud of Turin just by pure accident? The most definitive call would be comparative DNA analysis, if doable, the rest is circumstantial and don’t confuse circumstantial with meaningless or trivial that is not what I am implying. Kelly. DNA analysis is, in principle, circumstantial evidence as well. It bases on premise that chances for false positive match of DNA code is so small (1 in 14 bilion or so), that it can be ignored in most cases, and treated as direct evidence.

In the previous context, considering that all four Beatles at one time had beards & mustaches, the strongest piece of scientific evidence on the “amazing list of circumstances” was the same blood type. Even with shared blood type, albeit one that is the least represented in the population (~5% currently), this can only take you so far, you are still unable to reach a solid, scientific conclusion that the same individual is involved. Kelly, I think this is misrepresentation of the problem. All four Beatles had beards & mustaches at one time point, and so had both Shroud Man and Sudario Man, whether identical or not. But the problem is much more complex. 1. Both cloths (Shroud and Sudarium) beloged to crucified men. Fine, but there where many crucified individuals in history, and the fact that we have two cloths (and only those two cloths!) belonging to the victim(s) of crucifixion does not prove that there was one and the same person involved … yet. But… 2. Both cloths covered the face of the individual(s) that was apparently crucified with Crown of Thorns. There is only one recorded instance of the crucifixion combined with Crown of Thorns torture: Jesus of Nazareth. But of course this still does not prove antything… yet! Maybe there were several other crucifixions with the use of crown of thorns that went unrecorded? Maybe… but they couldn’t have been frequent. So how many? 1/100 crucifixions applied crown of thorns, or similar torture instrument? 1 in 1000? Yet we have, (by pure accident, sceptics would claim) two cloths that covered the face of crucified and crowned with thorns. 3. Test on both cloths indicate blood type AB. Only 5 % of world population has such group (18 % Sephardi Jews). Fine, this reduces the chance for coincidence 20 times (or only 5 if we assume that the cloths belonged to crucified Jew(s)). But of course this still does not prove anything… Maybe the tests were false positives due to contamination (amazing accident) or maybe we just found in the dump two cloths belonging to individuals with AB group. There are still such possibilities. 4. Both cloths belonged to individuals that had their heads bowed to ther right after death. Fine, this still does not prove anything, but there is 50 % chance for such coincidence… 5. Both crucified individuals had their right cheek swollen to much greater extent than left. Another interesting coincidence. Or maybe it is something we should have expected, because Jews considerd the right side as pure, and left as unclean? So that would be explanation, but of course the price is that we should assume that both Shroud and Sudario Men were beaten by Jews. 6. The facial features on both cloths (nose and face lenght, width etc.) are fully comparable. So both individuals had very similar features. Of course this does not prove anything there are many different people with similar facial features but that’s another similarity… And so on, if we make more studies of those both cloths we perhaps find more coincidences. But according to you, Kelly, this still isn’t evidence…. So according to you, Kelly, perhaps we may have heree two cloths belonging to two different individuals, but who were both severly beaten in their right cheeks, both were crucified and tortured with Crown of Thorns (we haven’t checked the correspondence of wounds yet), both had the same blood type, both had fully comparable face features, both had their heads banked to the right after death and so on… Do you really believe that this wheel within a wheel may be just accidental? Or do you need DNA tests to make ANY conclusions? One another thing about DNA, what if we extract them and the results turn different? Do you reject the identity of both Shroud and Sudario Men then, because the DNA comparison is the only real (and not circumstantial ) evidence for you (just like C 14 for the sceptics, at least till they turn in their favor)?.","date":"2015-02-20","mins":"3:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/12/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-as-evidence/","cat":"sudarium","title":"The Sudarium of Oviedo as Evidence?"},{"id":"comment-190814","author":"o_k","post":"Hugh: As for the ‘points of congruence’ game, it is invariably forgotten that ‘points of non congruence’ must also be taken into account.
