{"opinion":[{"author":"linda_zedler_talley","post":"My faith in Jesus Christ does not hinge on the authenticity (or not) of this cloth, but the latest scientific evidence makes a compelling case FOR its being authentic. Either way, it won’t matter, salvation-wise, to those who don’t want to believe in Christ, because He Himself said that even if one were to return from the dead, those who don’t want to believe, won’t. And guess what? Over 500 people at one time saw the post-crucifixion, resurrected Christ before He ascended to the Father and that still wasn’t “enough proof” for that day’s hardened hearts. Possible very soon, we will see Him again, and this time, He won’t be coming as a meek and mild Shepherd, but as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and Judge over all peoples. “Even so, come, Lord Jesus!”\n\n","date":"October 24, 2014 at 5:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/11/is-the-shroud-evidence-for-gods-existence/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Is the Shroud Evidence for God’s Existence?"}]}
