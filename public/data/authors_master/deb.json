I lost my 18 year old son on June 8, 2011.   I can only recommend reading Kat Kerr’s books on Revealing Heaven and you might feel a sense of relief that he is in heaven.  You will find grief is different for each member of your family.   My daughter refuses to talk about Scotty’s death.   It takes a lot of time to heal.   You probably won’t feel any healing for over a year.   You never stop thinking of your child that is for sure.  I hope GOD will heal your heart.","date":"November 23, 2012 at 5:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"deb","post":"My son died of meningitus June of 2011.  My cousin who works in a healing room sent me several books on heaven.  The book that healed my heart was by Kat Kerr- Revealing Heaven.  It was so painful to lose my son but GOD sent me those books through my cousin. GOD is amazing!","date":"November 23, 2012 at 5:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
