This year during springbreak in southwest Florida, my daughter and I went to the beach in Englewood (Blindpass beach) I don’t usally go to this one but because of the crowedness that’s here we ended up. I, while sitting on my towel with my camera in my lap, was approached by two women Sky and Cheryl. Sky comment on my camera and aked if a double exposed could be done on a digital camera. I told her that I was quite certain that that was not possible she said she had something to show me. I followed her to where her things were and she pulled out an envelop from Wallgreens photo that she had just stopped and was putting the photos from the weekend prior on a disk for her friend. She then pull a photo enlargement from it to show me that had a light in the sky that looked like a mans face and asked if I could see it. Yes, most definitely. The photo was taken the weekend prior at Stump Pass Beach at the point. Her friend Cheryl had taken the photo of sky walking the beach. This was following a conversation the 2 of them had about God. How no matter how many times we can screw up He still gives us chances to fix things. That it’s never to late as long as we have a breathe left! She not knowing that I was a christian or a photographer and the fact that I have been asking to see Jesus’ face for months picked me out of thousand! on that beach that day. I told her that if she wanted to email the photo to me, that I could work with it – adding more contrast to bring the image out even more that I would do that for her. She then handed me a 4 x 6 of it and asked if I could scan it. Well, I then took the photo and did everything to it to bring out the image and show it truly was in the photo and not something that was added. Within a couple of weeks, I then saw the show ‘The Real Face of Jesus’. I took photos of the 3 D image that they used the shroud image to comprise. It looked like the same image as what I had in that photo. I took that image and placed it on the photo and faded it out some and place it over the image – it was a match! I then showed the image to a lady at a church that I had just started attending and she said you have to see this she show me the painting that Akiane had painted what a remarkable site it matched too as I did the same process of combining images! Then to top it off, the poetry that she writes to go with each painting The title of it was It’s not too Late (remember the conversation between Sky and Cheryl It’s not too late!) then in reading it towards the bottom, she is referring to things changing into colors and she uses a ‘stump’ to change to the color brown. The photo was taken at ‘STUMP Pass beach’. I continue to call all this “A GOD THING” Following that, our church had a ladies tea just before Mother’s day. The Tea Party was done like a wedding reception – and we were the brides waiting for our bridegoom Jesus. Little did anyone know – but anarrangement had been made to have a mn dressed like Jesus to walk into the reception towards the end of the event. No one knew who this person was to be or seemed to know him looking at the photos of the tea party I wasn’t the only one that realized that the man looked just like the images we have been seeing! Our bridegroom Jesus himself????!!!!!!! A GOD thing!!!! Only God could fit all these things together and make them match!.","date":"2012-05-28","mins":"12:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/22/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud-revisited/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud Revisited"}]}
