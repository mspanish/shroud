Of course it’s not likely (with current technology) to extract good DNA samples from the Shroud, but the potential is there, of course, to find DNA from any number of sources on the material itself… who knows what the future will bring. The conflict of faith and religion have always been good “movie material” and this is no exception. Thank you for noticing our labor of love.
