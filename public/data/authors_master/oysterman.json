They started from the assumption that it is a fake and then they began investigating how can it be replicated.\n They did a research for 5 years and then concluded that they were unable to replicate it. Perhaps mr. Hamon, using his deep scientific knowledge should replicate the shroud so that this old story will be put to rest.\n\n","date":"January 13, 2012 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/italian-tv-on-the-enea-report/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Italian TV on the ENEA Report"}]}
