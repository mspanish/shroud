{"dating":[{"id":"comment-799","author":"job","post":"If the shroud of Turin were authentic, a reference to it would have been recorded in the Bible. No such reference to it (or the Holy Grail or other such objects that cropped up later when the church rejected to the apostolic faith in favor of myths and old wives’ fables, and syncretism) exists, and furthermore the existence, preservation and veneration of such objects (idols) oppose the goals of actual Biblical Christianity, which is concerned with the worship, reverence and veneration of the living God who is incorruptible Spirit, not of dead idols made by corrupt human hands out of corruptible sinful materials. The Shroud of Turin cannot be a witness to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The natural world only brings general revelation which cannot save, not special revelation which can and does save. So, the only witness to the resurrection of Jesus Christ is human witness, both spoken by humans who believe the testimony of those who did see, and who live this testimony through faith as evidenced by the good works of the priesthood of believers. So, instead of promoting and defending the gospel as revealed in scripture, we defend a cloth that scripture attaches no spiritual significance to whatsoever, and in doing so we turn our eyes from the Creator to the created and thus violate Romans 1. I hope and pray that all would use this episode with the shroud of Turin to reject idolatry, reject myth, and see the merits of sola scriptura, solo Christo, sola gratia, sola fide and soli Deo gloria!
