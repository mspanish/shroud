Pete Schumacher is an imaging expert and it is this expertise that is exercised in discussing Dr. Petrus Soons’ observations. From the document: “While it is true that not everyone has a VP‐8 Image Analyzer system available to them; and, while they may not have all the images available to them that I used in this study; I am convinced that this evidence is conclusive and can be readily duplicated by anyone reasonably capable in the disciplines applied while using a variety of easily accessible tools and even some readily accessible images.” This work has nothing to do with the halos as discussed here – the word is used to shorten “circular shading”. I need to change the wording on the website to keep others from coming to the same erroneous. It has to do with a shading around the facial image on the Shroud which would link the Shroud with the Mandylion. Concerning the historical implications of the results of this study, he writes this: “Thus, the Mandylion and the Shroud of Turin are on[e] and the same. Therefore, the Shroud of Turin existed at a time in accord with the known history of the Mandylion.
