The Shroud really is Christ’s shroud\n2. The creators of the shroud in 13th / 14th century Europe departed from the dominant artistic tradition, to create a more ‘authentic’ and believable relic. Something along the lines of “Hey, we all know, despite the artistic tradition, that Jesus was a bloodied and tortured mess, and this is the real thing because it provides evidence of that rather than being  a spotless cloth”. \n3. The Shroud was really Christ’s Shroud but the major blood markings were added to the body image in the 1300s. \nFurther to scenarios 2 and 3, there was the rise in the 1300s / 1400s of the German artistic movement that showed Christ much more tortured and wounded than even before, and in the mid 1300s the Black Death struck Europe, and there was the rise of flagellants who wounded themselves in the name of Christ.\nSo, certainly, by the time the Shroud was being displayed in Lirey, there was a tradition – unthinkable a century earlier – of Christ as heavily tortured, wounded and bloodied Saviour.\nRe: scenario 3. I’ve heard the argument against this sort of notion – “there is no image under the blood”. How definitive is this, how confident can we be in this assertion? Hugh, I think you may have questioned this assertion in the past? \nBy the way, I’ve been spending some time thinking about the so-called “wrist wounds”. You will all know that a common argument for authenticity is that the wound is on the wrist, not the palm of the hand as per the artistic tradition.\nWell, using Shroud Scope I have measured the length from the tip of the longest finger to the start of the wound, it came out at about 140mm, or 14cm, noting that it is somewhat difficult to precisely determine the end of the fingers – but I reckon I was close enough.\nI am 6 foot 2 inches tall, so not dissimilar in height to the supposed height of the man on the shroud. Measuring 14cm from the tip of my longest finger located the wound on my hand as per the shroud around mid palm. \nFor me, this commonly espoused pro-authenticity argument is wrong.\nNone of the above means I don’t believe the shroud is authentic (on balance, I do! mainly because of the inexplicability of a man-made image, and secondarily by some of the historic records of a seemingly shroud-like object in Constantinople). However, we may want to re-think the conventional wisdom that the shroud as mad made object departed heavily from the artistic / cultural traditions of the time vis a vis Christ as wounded and tortured saviour versus unblemished and glorified\n\n","date":"September 20, 2013 at 8:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"matthias","post":"further thought on the hands / wrist issue…\nlooking at the shroud scope negatives, there does seem to be evidence of visible detail of the metacarpal bones running down to the hand wound.\nNow, it has been proposed that this is a kind of “X Ray” effect.\nCould an alternative theory be that the driving of the nails through the hands (between two metacarpals?), and the subsequent removal of the nails, tore away flesh on the hand, hence exposing at least parts of the metacarpal bones, whose image was then transferred to the shroud (not necessarily via a radioactive mechanism).\nSurely the nail piercing and removal would have torn away flesh?\n\n","date":"September 20, 2013 at 9:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"matthias","post":"Tying this back to the Pray Manuscript…\nThe red lines still ‘frustrate me’.

I think your conclusions are overly simplistic and hasty. For example you say:\n“The Image of Edessa is nowhere described as tetradiplon AFTER Christ has wiped his face on it, and it could not have been Jesus’ burial shroud as this is listed in the Acts as a separate cloth (see the second quotation from the Acts of Thaddeus, above).” \nIf one read the tale as a literal story then you may be right. However, I think it is highly likely that this is a fable. If we assume it is a fable, then it was probably created to explain the Mandylion / Shroud facial image. If that is the case, and if the Mandylion WAS the shroud but with the face only shown due to the folding, then Wilson’s theory does hold up because in the tale the shroud is viewed as the Mandylion ie. as a separate object to the burial shroud (even though the shroud is actually the burial shroud).     \nAlso, I don’t think the fact that the cloth is referred to separately as a tetradiplon then as a sindon (after Jesus’ face has been wiped) is necessarily that significant, or problematic. In life, we often describe one object in different ways within one body of text or conversation.  \nFurther, I think the variations in the tales over time, including at least one that refers to the full body image, merely hints at some secrecy, mystery and ambiguity behind it all.  \nThis is probably where symbolism, cryptology etc enters the fray, where meanings, histories etc get ambiguous and sometimes hidden / half hidden.\n\n","date":"September 7, 2013 at 3:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"matthias","post":"De Wesselow is an art historian, a PhD from Cambridge  I believe with good credentials.

But the fact that the lower object has a pattern and the shroud in the upper image does not have a pattern doesn’t mean much, if anything, to the central question here.\nDe Wesselow describes the difficulty for an artist – particularly one who is not highly skilled and working on a small medium such as the Pray Manuscript artist – in representing the blurry shroud image. The artist has shown the body, which mirrors the image, after all in the upper anointing scene. And given the faint, ephemeral-like image of the Shroud, is there not some logic in conveying it in a hazily symbolic artistic manner?    \nThen, conveying the shroud in the lower image with patterns, shapes, lines, ephemeral objects etc makes total sense.\nTo take this further – the upper image is a highly literal image, the lower image is filled with symbolism and mystique. Was the different treatment intentional, to highlight the worldly experience of Christ’s anointing versus the otherworldly experience of the empty tomb with the angel etc????  \nThe two images are entirely different in a stylistic sense, so it makes little sense to compare one with the other. They might have even been drawn by different artists!   \nI hear people consistently dismiss any significance to the two wiggly red lines. Now, if one accepts that it is highly unlikely that the artist would have just randomly drawn these (they make no sense from a decorative perspective), then I would argue that there is no logical explanation other than blood, in which case blood on a coffin lid doesn’t make sense, blood on a shroud does.    \nSimilarly, casual dismissal of the circles / dots is also all too easy.\n\n","date":"September 10, 2013 at 4:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"matthias","post":"yes I wasn’t convinced by Charles’ answer that he consulted with specialists.

This is patently untrue. Both images are entirely consistent with dozens of contemporary illustrations of the scenes they depict, and appear, together, in almost exactly the same format, in one of the illustrations I quoted above. Cloth, in both illustrations, looks like cloth, and rigid stuff, in both illustrations, looks like rigid stuff.\nIt was perhaps an exaggeration on my part to call the images “entirely different”. “Different” would have been better. The figures are in a similar illustrative artistic style. But my main point is still highly relevant and “True” (rather than patently untrue),  I believe. That is, the upper image is essentially literal, the lower image is largely symbolic, mystical and cryptic – so the images are different in “nature and meaning” if not “artistic style”  (it’s as if the artist ate some magic mushrooms between drawing the two images). I don’t know why this is, but can only speculate it might have something to do with trying to represent the mystical, mysterious experience of the resurrection, versus the worldly nature of Jesus’s burial preparation.\nYou argue that there is a great degree of continuity with artistic tradition. There certainly is some continuity! But there is also clearly evident discontinuity! This includes:\n– Jesus shown naked. Yes I know there are couple of examples elsewhere of Him naked but this is still very much an overwhelming minority of the artistic tradition (probably less than 1%)\n– Jesus with a small beard (more like scruff). Now this is very very odd, given the overwhelming tradition of the time of a reasonably fully bearded Jesus. Why? Again speculation, but in the  very faint image (not contrast enhanced) on the shroud it is difficult to view the facial hair as being much more than a relatively small ‘goatee’. I keep an open mind but struggle to come up with any alternative explanations given the tradition discontinuity\n– And the greatest discontinuity occurs in the lower image, where there seems to be no comparable tradition in terms of the style of decorative depiction of the rectangular objects, no comparison in terms of red blood-like streaks and L shaped hole configurations, no comparison in terms of a face (Jesus’s?) adjacent to Mary’s sleeve, with an intermediary letter / symbol ‘floating’ between Mary and the rectangular object !!!\nChrisB (comment 94) may have a point that the object is the Shroud lying across the coffin lid.  \nThe likelihood is we will never be able to fully understand these things, and it will always come down to interpretation and points of view. I agree that many of the points I and others make can be considered speculative, although I think there is some strength to the view that the number of possible congruences, even if cryptic, between these images and the Shroud are perhaps too many to claim ‘coincidence’.\n\n","date":"September 10, 2013 at 10:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"matthias","post":"Interesting paper by a Holger A Klein “Sacred Relics and Imperial Ceremonies at the Great Palace of Constantinople”\nhttp://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/Klein/Sacred-Relics-and-Imperial-Ceremonies.pdf\nInteresting reference to an “acheiropoietos icon” of Christ, which, according to George Kedrenos, arrived in the capital (Constantinople) “from those of Kamouliana, a village in Cappadocia” in the reign of Justin II (565-578AD). \nI’d never heard of this before.

I think someone (maybe Max?) has previously argued that the object represents a lid AND the shroud.\nIn many paintings the angel points to two linen objects. If the rectangular object is the shroud, and then sitting upon that is a further cloth, then the codex image is consistent with that.\nNote page 3 of chapter 3 of Brooks’ book says of representations of the time :\n“the open tomb. Angel clothed in white is seated on the lid; he holds a lance with one hand and with the other points to the shroud AND winding sheet in the bottom of the tomb”  (my capitals) \nYou can faintly make out in the codex image that the angel is sitting on a box-like object (a stone?) rather than on the rectangular object.\nthe 4 L shaped cricles are still curious to me. At one point I thought they may symbolise holes like in a ten pin bowling ball ie. holes you could put your fingers into to lift a lid up. But I doubt it. I’ve seen no precedence of such for a sarcophagus lid.\nAnd the two red streaks make absolutely no sense other than representing Christ’s blood.\nOverall, I am more compelled than not that the object DOES represent the shroud, especially when coupled with the very shroud-like image of Christ being anointed above it.\n\n","date":"August 27, 2013 at 9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"author":"matthias","post":"Yannick\nI find your resistance to any possiblity of a supernatural cause for the image formation curious.

So it then becomes futile trying to explain the image creation via scientifically verifiable means, ie. radiation etc.\nI agree that the dematerialisation of Christ’s body didn’t necessarily release radiation which created the image.

This would mean that either this trickle somehow flowed down from the dead man’s ribs and dripped down and ran along  the shroud AFTER he was placed in the shroud, or it is a later fabrication (it wouldn’t make sense that the body was washed first, except for a post mortem trickle of blood across the lower back, then the flow we see on the lower back region on the shroud was transferred by contact between body and shroud when the absence of scourge marks strongly indicate there was no contact – if you get my drift!) .\nIf it was the former, then that could explain why the trickle is so close in one or two spots to the scourge marks, getting around Yannick’s questions around the precision of the clean up.\nThink about it, only really (impossibly?) thick blood might run down the ribs of a horizontally laid out corpse and run all the way along the small of the back.

The scenario I raised was that the body image was created from Christ’s body, there were no bloodstains (with Christ having been washed, and no post mortem blood flows leaving stains on the cloth), then later, perhaps in the middle ages, blood was applied onto the shroud, in an effort to elevate the shroud’s status as a holy relic.\nSome historic evidence provides some support for this idea.\nRobert de Clari’s account of 1203 refers to Christ’s figure, but not to a bloodied and crucified figure. The lack of reference to a “bloodied” figure does not of course mean the image he was referring to was NOT bloodied.\nIn addition, Nicholas Mesarites in 1201 refers to the image as the “un-outlined, dead, naked and embalmed body”. Again, no specific reference to bloodstains, but again does not preclude the possibility that the image WAS blood stained. The reference to the dead body might imply bloodstains, or it might not.\nSimilarly, the Pray Manuscript shows Christ laid out, being prepared for burial, and about to be wrapped in a shroud. Again, this image does not show a bloodied Christ. \nNote, I am not saying this is what I think definitely happened. the point of this scenario was to counter Colin’s view that if the bloodstains were on top of the body image, then the case for authenticity would be destroyed.\nAs I outline, the case would not be destroyed, although it probably would be weakened.\nThere are some difficulties for this theory, chief amongst them in my mind:\n– If the blood was added in the middle ages, why the curious trickles of blood across the lower back. Whilst other blood wounds are conceivable as a middle age addition, these trickles of blood argue for the cloth having wrapped a real dead body \n– in my view the blood stains appear hyper real, such as the foot stains. Can we really think that these hyper real blood stains were added in the middle ages, when the depiction of Christ’s blood stains were typically very ‘unrealistic’ (a couple of small red dots on the hands and feet, a little gash and trickle of blood from the side wound). Or maybe the middle ages “blood adder” was really determined to do a really convincing ultra real addition?\n\n","date":"June 22, 2013 at 8:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/20/colin-berry-a-hunch-just-that-that-rogers-may-have-been-used/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry:  a hunch – just that – that Rogers may have been used"},{"author":"matthias","post":"sorry again off topic.

I have no doubt that Jesus’s followers experienced his resurrected presence, whatever that precisely was. \nThe FACT is that we have Paul, someone who was a strong opponent of the Jesus movement, converting within just a few years of Jesus’s death.\nWe know from Paul’s letters that he had a vision of Jesus. We also know that he attests to over 500 witnesses to Jesus’s resurrection. His account is not just based on a subjective vision that might have been a hallucination, but is also backed up by accounts of direct witnesses. Now, Paul was a pretty matter of fact guy, a pretty credible witness, and very intelligent. And he attests to those witnesses, ‘many of whom are still alive’ – in a very matter of fact way. This IS a historical account.  \nWe also know that Paul emphasized the spiritual, non-material aspect of the resurrection, rather than a bodily resuscitation. You assume that Christianity is based on the revival of Jesus’s physical body. Now some Christians clearly believed that, and do today, but Paul didn’t, and neither do I!  \nAnd what of the women witnesses. I know it is a cliche. But the fact remains that a made up story in first century Palestine would have hardly been likely to make up women witnesses to the resurrection. \nI have had a number of experiences in life that defy rational explanation. I am a PhD with an IQ of over 150. I realise that these experiences, and my Christian belief, defy atheistic and rationalistic belief. But all I know and experience is all I know and experience.

Those would have been the Sanhedrin, specifically Caiaphas. They presumably did not want Jesus’s tomb to become a shrine, a place to rally and further the Jesus movement. A more plausible and more likely scenario could have involved two or more priest novices (who were traditionally dressed in white robes), sent by the Sanhedrin (Caiaphus), to remove the corpse during the night (who else could have gotten past the Roman soldiers guarding the tomb, and gotten help in removing the heavy stone in front of it). Then, they taking the corpse into the Negev desert, left it there to be devoured by wild dogs.(1) \nDoesn’t make sense I am afraid. Getting rid of the body and then making up a story about the resurrection would have had the effect of rallying Jesus’s followers, rather than disheartening them, especially as Jesus prophesized the resurrection,\nThe best thing Caiaphas could do would have been to do nothing. If he did nothing, and the resurrection did not happen, then it is highly likely that the Jesus movement would have just passed.

If one was 2 metres long and say 1 m high, then the 4m shroud would cover the table, and then fall down over each end of the table to the floor. If the frontal and dorsal heads were central on the altar table, then the space between the head images might have been where the bread and wine was placed….and then there would be a symbolic connection between the body and blood of Christ as seen on the Shroud, and the bread and wine….this is totally speculative but worth a shot! \nPoint 2\nI’ve always been a little bit unconvinced by the authenticist’s argument of “why go to so much effort to fake a relic when much more unconvincing fake relics were being flogged and traded”.\nLike any market, I’m sure more convincing fake relics could attract higher prices.\nSo your subpoints a and b are good ones, although I think ultimately fall down for several reasons being the usual concerns around “how”.\nRe: your subpoint b, that’s an idea I’ve though of, but I’m just not convinced by it for several reasons, most particularly the ultra realistic body image of the dorsal (I’m convinced that no painter of that era would have depicted the body in that fashion – de Wesselow argues convincingly to that effect)\nAnother thought…with the un-shroud like dimensions of the SOT, can one contemplate Joseph of Arimathea desperately seeking SOME form of linen cloth to wrap Jesus, and being unable to obtain a typical shroud, making do with a cut from a merchant that would suffice?    .\n\n","date":"December 25, 2013 at 7:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/23/did-the-apostles-notice-an-image-on-the-cloth/","cat":"history","title":"Did the Apostles Notice an Image on the Cloth?"},{"author":"matthias","post":"OK, that piece by Guscin on the Old Mozarabic Liturgy is fascinating, thank you.

Indeed, arguably none of the similarities in their own right can argue for the link in a compelling sense. It is the collective weight of the multiple similarities that presents a compelling case.\nI think a point I’ve made elsewhere is very relevant. In the 1100s, without the 1532 fire burn marks, the L shaped poker holes would have been conspicuous – and that provides a good reason why they would be shown in a depiction such as the Pray Manuscript – especially if they held some symbolic meaning, perhaps a meaning supporting the shroud’s holy status as a relic that can defy destruction.\nSince the fire in 1532, the L shaped holes, although clearly observable, became less conspicuous.\nSo, in the first known painted copy of the Shroud from 1516, prior to the fire in 1532, the poker holes take a prominent place in the depiction. In later depictions the prominent fire burns from 1532 are depicted, but not the poker holes. \nThis, I think, addresses the question from some skeptics as to why the Pray Manuscript artist would depict the L shaped holes, seemingly meaningless features. They were depicted because at the time the artist worked they were conspicuous features of the shroud and probably held some meaning.\n\n","date":"September 22, 2013 at 4:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/21/so-is-that-the-shroud-of-turin-depicted-in-the-hungarian-pray-codex/","cat":"history","title":"So is that the Shroud of Turin depicted in the Hungarian Pray Codex?"},{"author":"matthias","post":"yes the holes make no sense as random elements, nor as decorative elements ( they might if they were repeated).\nAnd I think they make no sense as apertures either.

This is especially so when there is already a symbolic aspect to the lower image, with the floating letter, and the head next to Mary’s sleeve.\nThere might be symbolism in the HPM image along the lines of the shroud representing both the worldly and human aspect of Jesus and worldly objects(the holes and the blood streaks) and the otherworldly and divine (the crosses, the head of Jesus next to Mary’s sleeve representing an intermediary between death and resurrection state).

Remarkably, it is the icons made before 1300 that nearly always show a properly loin-clothed Christ, while the paintings after 1300 more often show a naked body. If the relative proportion of naked to clothed images alone were a true reflection of the provenance of the shroud, one would have to say that it was more likely to have appeared in mediaeval times than in antiquity.”\nTrue, whilst many (I would disagree with you that ‘most’ do) paintings after 1300 do show Jesus naked with not necessary a full thick loin cloth like earlier depictions, but more like a wisp of much less substantial cloth, they still protect Christ’s modesty with very few exceptions. But to be frank, I don’t think this has any bearing whatsoever on the authenticity argument. The emergence of “Skimpier’ loin cloths may just reflect the fact that artistic depictions became more realistic, and also started to show Christ in more realistic agony and suffering. Less loin cloth protection could be considered part of this movement. Or maybe reflects the fact that the Shroud figure has no protection, which influenced the artistic evolution closer towards ‘nothing’.\nThe undeniable fact remains that for the most part artists still sought to protect Christ’s modesty. Even several of the artistic copies of the Shroud from the 1500s – 1600s depict the shroud figure with a full loin cloth! \nAgain, I don’t think the fact that most depictions of Christ before 1300 show him with a full loin cloth argues against authenticity either. The fact that several copies of the shroud from the 1500s and 1600s shows the shroud figure with a loin cloth indicates a long tradition of wanting to preserve Christ’s modesty with a loin cloth, regardless of the fact that the figure on the shroud IS NOT protected by a loin cloth.\n\n","date":"March 27, 2013 at 8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/22/three-new-shroud-of-turin-websites-to-watch/","cat":"history","title":"Three New Shroud of Turin Websites to Watch"},{"author":"matthias","post":"Further, the bulky shoulder blades etc which Colin refers to are NOT armour.

However, this is my way around that problem…\nPerhaps the image on the shroud was recorded from the first moments of the resurrection process, perhaps just as the body was commencing dematerialisation. Somehow – I don’t know how, and I am not concerned with that absence  of knowledge given the unknowable mystery of the miraculous resurrection – the image is recorded, then  the body dematerialises. The shroud is left behind, with its image which I might add in my very subjective view is serene in expression rather than tortured, almost expressing a knowing expression of His coming glorified transformation.\nJesus then rematerialises in a spiritual bodily form, and that is his resurrection.\nSo in this way of thinking, the shroud image is a last snapshot of Christ’s mortal body immediately prior to his dematerialisation and then rematerialisation (ie. resurrection). It is the physical record of Christ’s human mortality, which complements the historic record (the bible) and the spiritual record (his immortal presence) of his glorified resurrection    \nSo we have been left with physical, intellectual (the written word) and spiritual confirmation of his status.  ;\n\n","date":"September 18, 2013 at 9:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?"},{"author":"matthias","post":"Indeed.

At the time, I thought that here was an interpretation that many would-be Christians would be able to accept, and so remove a hurdle to their belief. It is a fact of our times that many would-be Christians are of a similar view, that the Resurrection as a real historical event is a hurdle that denies their full acceptance of Christianity. The liberal radicals, such as those in the ‘Jesus Seminar’ cannot accept it, seeing it as illogical and unthinkable.”\nDaveb- not sure about the last sentence. Isn’t Marcus Borg part of the ‘Jesus Seminar’? My understanding is that Borg accepts the Resurrection as a real historical event, not in the sense of a physical bodily resuscitation, but in the sense of a spiritual bodily resurrection? ie. he appeared to the disciples as a real SPIRITUAL BODILY PRESENCE / VISION. This was of course recast in some parts of the Bible into a “bodily resuscitation” type of resurrection to accord with Jewish belief and to try and make tangible what we can only assume to be an experience of the risen Christ as a spiritual body that was so real that it also “Seemed” physical.\nPaul of course tends to emphasise the “Spiritual Body” aspects of the resurrected Jesus, over a skin and bones resuscitation.\nIs it necessary to believe in the resurrection of Jesus as a real historical event to be a Christian???…\n\n","date":"May 7, 2013 at 4:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"matthias","post":"Colin\nI have no answer to your questions, these are questions that theologians have debated for centuries!!!

That is, Christ’s body dematerialised, and in the event of dematerialising the body left the image behind. So, under this theory, the image does not have to be perfect, as it resulted from a naturalistic process caused by a divine event. Under this theory I have no idea what that naturalistic process could be – obviously bodies do not dematerialise (with the possible exception of Christ) so we can’t measure the naturalistic side effects of that process. I don’t necessarily buy radiation theories.\nI’ve provided an analogy before, I’ll provide it again.

One  dish fell on another and created a small crack on one of the dishes.\nNow, if this really was a spiritual event then one can say that the rattling of the dishes was caused by a spiritual event, but the crack in the dish was explained naturalistically by one dish hitting another.
