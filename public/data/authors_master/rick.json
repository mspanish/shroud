are saying submission to husbands….best explanation from “catholic answers”:: As men, you are to die for your family — love your wife as Christ loved the Church. Sacrificial love. As women, we are to submit to the mission (support the mission, translated) of the man, which is to serve the family. The word “submission” can be broken down into ‘sub’ meaning ‘under’ and ‘mission’ something a person is commissioned to do. So, in this case, a woman who submits to her husband is putting herself ‘under the mission’ of her husband. And what is the mission of her husband? “Husbands, LOVE YOUR WIVES!” A wife is to let her husband love her as he loves his own body, and to sacrifice himself for her as Christ did for His Church.

Think this is the reason the Virgin Mary is mentioned: “The prospect Islamic and Christian – explain the organizers – the son of the Virgin Mary will be juxtaposed in a comparison that helps to understand what they have in common Christian and Muslim brothers in faith in the one God of Abraham.”.","date":"2015-01-06","mins":"11:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/06/news-story-from-sindone-org/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"News Story from Sindone.org"},{"id":"comment-192990","author":"rick","post":"I too hope you stay…but disagree with you on the “message of the shroud”…the message has always been there…but the question on may of our minds is whether God has left something behind for us…I don’t know if it’s real or not, but at least that’s the message I want to know,,,come on daveb!…we need you here!.","date":"2015-03-09","mins":"5:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/nice-review-of-russ-breaults-presentation-in-wisconsin/","cat":"article","title":"Nice Review of Russ Breault’s Presentation in Wisconsin"},{"id":"comment-193082","author":"rick","post":"As I recall he viewed psychology as “the cure of souls”.","date":"2015-03-10","mins":"6:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/nice-review-of-russ-breaults-presentation-in-wisconsin/","cat":"article","title":"Nice Review of Russ Breault’s Presentation in Wisconsin"},{"id":"comment-193049","author":"rick","post":"Agree Russ..have been watching your presentations online on youtube….excellent…..I actually agree with you for the most part…just don’t want to get my hopes up!.","date":"2015-03-10","mins":"9:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/nice-review-of-russ-breaults-presentation-in-wisconsin/","cat":"article","title":"Nice Review of Russ Breault’s Presentation in Wisconsin"},{"id":"comment-207505","author":"rick","post":"Good one doc!.","date":"2015-08-05","mins":"4:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/05/scientist-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"article","title":"Scientist Barrie Schwortz"},{"id":"comment-211585","author":"rick","post":"Exactly OK…….Mary herself referred to her perpetual virginity related to Fatima (hence 5 first Saturday devotion) and at Guadalupe : “During her initial apparitions to Juan on December 9, the Blessed Virgin Mary had spoken of herself by saying: “Know for certain, dearest of my sons, that I am the perfect and perpetual Virgin Mary, Mother of the true God, through whom everything lives, the Lord of all things, who is Master of heaven and earth. … I am your merciful Mother” So…think i’ll believe Mary instead of the “reformers” who believe Jesus just left a cookbook instead of a Church..","date":"2015-09-30","mins":"4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/28/the-shroud-of-canterbury/","cat":"article","title":"The Shroud of Canterbury"},{"id":"comment-211595","author":"rick","post":"Daveb…..over 70,000 witnessed Fatima…..including atheistic press (which documented it)..if you don’t like Guadalupe try Fatima….don’t usually agree with you, but always enjoy your posts.","date":"2015-09-30","mins":"7:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/28/the-shroud-of-canterbury/","cat":"article","title":"The Shroud of Canterbury"},{"id":"comment-192446","author":"rick","post":"More anticatholic trash.","date":"2015-03-04","mins":"8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/04/inside-the-popes-bedroom-and-more/","cat":"books","title":"Inside the pope’s bedroom and more"},{"id":"comment-214833","author":"rick","post":"Travel was a bit different in those days as well.","date":"2015-11-19","mins":"11:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/19/just-in-time-for-christmas-the-relic-master/","cat":"books","title":"Just in time for Christmas:  The Relic Master"},{"id":"comment-191926","author":"rick","post":"Andrea…what do you mean “the shroud is French”…the Shroud belongs to the Catholic Church….I understand the chain of custody…doen’t mean it’s French.","date":"2015-02-26","mins":"7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/new-book-by-mario-latendresse/","cat":"books","title":"New Book by Mario Latendresse"},{"id":"comment-182453","author":"rick","post":"Hmm..Catholics…prop for faith?…not sure the Catholc Church has stated these “relics” are real…as far as I know, they have the same position on them as the shroud…..we don’t need props….when I was in Rome, I remember the Vatican guide stated that they doubted it was a piece of the true cross… nice shot though!

Jesus Himself during the years of His public ministry did not care for His mother, as it would appear He is literally commanding John to do. Rather, He left her in Nazareth while He travelled through Galilee and Judaea preaching the Good News. And He would later tell John and the others that they must go forth to all nations teaching them the Good News. He did not intend that John should spend the rest of his life caring for the Blessed Virgin. Certainly, John took on responsibility for the care of Mary, but relying strictly on such a literal translation is clearly insufficient. Throughout his gospel, John speaks in symbolic terms. The synoptic gospels do not record this detail in recounting the facts of that day. No, rather, Jesus commissioned His mother to be the Mother of all Christians, and by giving her to John who personifies the Christian people, He commands us to accept her as our own mother. At least that’s how most Catholics (and I) see it……even Benedict.","date":"2015-03-12","mins":"6:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"id":"comment-193248","author":"rick","post":"Good for you sampath…but that that’s not what my Church teaches…as far as step brothers and sisters at least….but your free to interpret it as you like…..again….at fatima…Mary commented on people who question her virginity…take a look at the reasons for the 5 first saturday devotions.","date":"2015-03-12","mins":"6:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"id":"comment-193249","author":"rick","post":"The Church has always understood these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin Mary.

The woman alluded to as being at enmity or hostility with the serpent is Mary. It was God who put this total opposition between Mary and Satan, and we believe it to be in the same likeness as Christ’s hostility with the seed of the serpent: sinful humanity. For Mary to be like Christ in His hostility with Satan and his offspring, it is reasonable to say that this passage implies Mary’s lack of sin and affinity with the devil. There is no surer way to be in total hostility with Satan than to be in the fullness of God’s constant grace (cf. Lk 1:28) and than to observe the will of God and abide by it. It was by the His grace, that God put Mary and Satan in a complete state of opposition and had the woman and the serpent become genuine enemies with hatred for each other, which the Hebrew word for enmity (eybah) denotes. Mary would be a friend of Satan if at any moment she had sinned and consequently be an unworthy mother of our Lord. Eve was at enmity with God at the time she mortally sinned against Him and did what was hateful in His sight..","date":"2015-03-13","mins":"10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"id":"comment-193305","author":"rick","post":"Jason..we believe the church that Jesus founded, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore interpret the gospel correctly…..there are many other churches…with many different “personal interpretations”..i doubt Jesus meant many different interpretations of the same scripture (but that’s what happens with personal interpretation) as far as Mary in concerned…have heard it all before….thanks for your blog, but think i’ll stick with the Churches interpretations of miricles…not your personal interpretations….interesting blog though!.","date":"2015-03-13","mins":"5:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"id":"comment-193208","author":"rick","post":"Haha…what a crock…..anyway Jesus entrusted Mary to John….If Jesus had a blood brother, there would be no need for this….very simple.","date":"2015-03-12","mins":"9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"id":"comment-193309","author":"rick","post":"Mary did disclose this to one of the seer’s (Lucy)…..:: you can chose to believe this or not….we can get into the predictions regarding fatima, the fact that the athesitic press reported the miracle ot the sun, the fact that jean paul was shot of may 13 THE DAY AND HOUR of the first appearance of Mary at fatima 60 years before; predictions coming true etc; but mary explained this herself: She explained later that she had been given to understand that this related to the five main types of blasphemies and offences committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary: that is against the Immaculate Conception; AGAINST MARYS VIRGINITY; against her Divine Maternity and her spiritual motherhood of mankind; for the offences of those who encourage in the hearts of children indifference, contempt and even hatred of her, and finally as reparation for those who outrage her in her holy images.
