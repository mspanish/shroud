So, in this case, a woman who submits to her husband is putting herself ‘under the mission’ of her husband. And what is the mission of her husband? “Husbands, LOVE YOUR WIVES!” A wife is to let her husband love her as he loves his own body, and to sacrifice himself for her as Christ did for His Church.

Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"rick","post":"Dan, again sorry to see you go…i’ve been thinking of something you said….that comment about someone saying the shroud was a Catholic relic…not sure if I said it, but it sounds like something I would say.If it was me, I probably said it because someone took a direct or indirect shot at the Catholic faith….that happened from time to time on this blog.I also had to smile when you wrote your “if it was up to me” examples in regard to communion and baptism…guess that’s why there are so many denominations…because men say “if it were up to me”…doubt Jesus meant us to have 1000 different interpretations on what he said.While I understands that we don’t really know where the shroud was early in it’s history….it could have very well been in Catholic hands…..one thing for sure….it’s now where God wants  it…in Catholic hands…whether the shroud is real or not.I’ll miss you and this blog…hope you have a great Christmas and good luck with your good

is not simply Jesus being a concerned son, even in His last agonizing moments before death, ensuring His mother would be well cared for. Jesus Himself during the years of His public ministry did not care for His mother, as it would appear He is literally commanding John to do. Rather, He left her in Nazareth while He travelled through Galilee and Judaea preaching the Good News. And He would later tell John and the others that they must go forth to all nations teaching them the Good News. He did not intend that John should spend the rest of his life caring for the Blessed Virgin. Certainly, John took on responsibility for the care of Mary, but relying strictly on such a literal translation is clearly insufficient. Throughout his gospel, John speaks in symbolic terms. The synoptic gospels do not record this detail in recounting the facts of that day. No, rather, Jesus commissioned His mother to be the Mother of all Christians, and by giving her to John who personifies the Christian people, He commands us to accept her as our own mother.

In fact James and Joseph, “brothers of Jesus,” are the sons of another Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew significantly calls “the other Mary.” They are close relations of Jesus, according to an Old Testament expression. (CCC 500)The Catechism here refers to the fact that 14 chapters after we find the “brothers” of the Lord listed as “James, Joseph, Simon and Judas,” we find “James and Joseph” mentioned again, but this time their mother is revealed as being named Mary, but not Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

The woman alluded to as being at enmity or hostility with the serpent is Mary. It was God who put this total opposition between Mary and Satan, and we believe it to be in the same likeness as Christ’s hostility with the seed of the serpent: sinful humanity. For Mary to be like Christ in His hostility with Satan and his offspring, it is reasonable to say that this passage implies Mary’s lack of sin and affinity with the devil. There is no surer way to be in total hostility with Satan than to be in the fullness of God’s constant grace (cf. Lk 1:28) and than to observe the will of God and abide by it. It was by the His grace, that God put Mary and Satan in a complete state of opposition and had the woman and the serpent become genuine enemies with hatred for each other, which the Hebrew word for enmity (eybah) denotes. Mary would be a friend of Satan if at any moment she had sinned and consequently be an unworthy mother of our Lord.
