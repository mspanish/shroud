As women, we are to submit to the mission (support the mission, translated) of the man, which is to serve the family.\nThe word “submission” can be broken down into ‘sub’-meaning ‘under’- and ‘mission’- something a person is commissioned to do. So, in this case, a woman who submits to her husband is putting herself ‘under the mission’ of her husband. And what is the mission of her husband? \n“Husbands, LOVE YOUR WIVES!” \nA wife is to let her husband love her as he loves his own body, and to sacrifice himself for her as Christ did for His Church.

http://www.catholic-pages.com/bvm/mother.asp:\nThis is not simply Jesus being a concerned son, even in His last agonizing moments before death, ensuring His mother would be well cared for. Jesus Himself during the years of His public ministry did not care for His mother, as it would appear He is literally commanding John to do. Rather, He left her in Nazareth while He travelled through Galilee and Judaea preaching the Good News. And He would later tell John and the others that they must go forth to all nations teaching them the Good News. He did not intend that John should spend the rest of his life caring for the Blessed Virgin. \nCertainly, John took on responsibility for the care of Mary, but relying strictly on such a literal translation is clearly insufficient. Throughout his gospel, John speaks in symbolic terms. The synoptic gospels do not record this detail in recounting the facts of that day. \nNo, rather, Jesus commissioned His mother to be the Mother of all Christians, and by giving her to John who personifies the Christian people, He commands us to accept her as our own mother. \nAt least that’s how most Catholics (and I) see it……even Benedict\n\n","date":"March 12, 2015 at 6:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"good for you sampath…but that that’s not what my Church teaches…as far as step brothers and sisters at least….but your free to interpret it as you like…..again….at fatima…Mary commented on people who question her virginity…take a look at the reasons for the 5 first saturday devotions\n\n","date":"March 12, 2015 at 6:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"at least that’s how i see it….good breakdown of both sides on this link:\nhttp://www.catholic.com/magazine/articles/the-case-for-mary%E2%80%99s-perpetual-virginity\nhowever….i know there are enough “experts” here allready\n\n","date":"March 12, 2015 at 7:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"The Church has always understood these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin Mary. In fact James and Joseph, “brothers of Jesus,” are the sons of another Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew significantly calls “the other Mary.” They are close relations of Jesus, according to an Old Testament expression. (CCC 500)\nThe Catechism here refers to the fact that 14 chapters after we find the “brothers” of the Lord listed as “James, Joseph, Simon and Judas,” we find “James and Joseph” mentioned again, but this time their mother is revealed as being named Mary, but not Mary, the Mother of Jesus. We can conclude that “James and Joseph” are “brothers” of Jesus, but they are not uterine brothers.\n\n","date":"March 12, 2015 at 7:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"could not get it to load…will try to get to it when i get home..thanks\n\n","date":"March 13, 2015 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"Davidb…..guess it comes down to opinion…as for my Catholic opinion..and since Mary said it at fatima…she was a virgin….so it’s my opinon there are forces in this world that argue against it:\nGenesis 3:15 is the first verse that reveals to us how Mary would become the New Eve. The woman alluded to as being at enmity or hostility with the serpent is Mary. It was God who put this total opposition between Mary and Satan, and we believe it to be in the same likeness as Christ’s hostility with the seed of the serpent: sinful humanity. For Mary to be like Christ in His hostility with Satan and his offspring, it is reasonable to say that this passage implies Mary’s lack of sin and affinity with the devil. There is no surer way to be in total hostility with Satan than to be in the fullness of God’s constant grace (cf. Lk 1:28) and than to observe the will of God and abide by it. It was by the His grace, that God put Mary and Satan in a complete state of opposition and had the woman and the serpent become genuine enemies with hatred for each other, which the Hebrew word for enmity (eybah) denotes. Mary would be a friend of Satan if at any moment she had sinned and consequently be an unworthy mother of our Lord. Eve was at enmity with God at the time she mortally sinned against Him and did what was hateful in His sight.\n\n","date":"March 13, 2015 at 10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"Jason..we believe the church that Jesus founded, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore interpret the gospel  correctly…..there are many other churches…with many different “personal interpretations”..i doubt Jesus meant many different interpretations of the same scripture (but that’s what happens with personal interpretation)\nas far as Mary in concerned…have heard it all before….thanks for your blog, but think i’ll stick with the Churches interpretations of miricles…not your personal interpretations….interesting blog though!\n\n","date":"March 13, 2015 at 5:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"Mary did disclose this to one of the seer’s (Lucy)…..:: you can chose to believe this or not….we can get into the predictions regarding fatima, the fact that the athesitic press reported the miracle ot the sun, the fact that jean-paul was shot of may 13\nTHE DAY AND HOUR of the first appearance of Mary at fatima\n60 years before; predictions coming true etc;\nbut mary explained this herself:\nShe explained later that she had been given to understand that this related to the five main types of blasphemies and offences committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary: that is against the Immaculate Conception; AGAINST MARYS VIRGINITY; against her Divine Maternity and her spiritual motherhood of mankind; for the offences of those who encourage in the hearts of children indifference, contempt and even hatred of her, and finally as reparation for those who outrage her in her holy images.\nguess it aint logical to you though!\nlets get back to the original subject…were not going to convince each other…\n\n","date":"March 13, 2015 at 5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"haha…what a crock…..anyway Jesus  entrusted Mary to John….If Jesus had a blood brother, there would be no need for this….very simple\n\n","date":"March 12, 2015 at 9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"author":"rick","post":"The new Catechism of the Catholic Church asserts:\nIn sum, God created the devil as good, God punished him for his sin and God allows his present activity.
