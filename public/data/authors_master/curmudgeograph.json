E.g., the reason that radical Darwinists propose random mutation and natural selection is it seems to them more concept-economical than say love or God being behind it all.  So Occam may be good for creating hypotheses, or picking which experiment to run, but if it’s broke, it’s broke and ya maybe gotta add a litlle more complexity.\n\n","date":"September 14, 2012 at 2:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/08/this-will-hurt-your-brain-even-more/","cat":"science","title":"This Will Hurt Your Brain Even More"},{"author":"curmudgeograph","post":"In the semesters I spent in graduate philosophy classes, I never found that the good and worthwile parts were the professional academic parts.  Randomness is legitimate grist for the mill.  We can talk about the pseudo-randomness that computers can give us, we can talk about not being able to account for the factors determining the roll of the dice, we can talk Schrodinger, we can talk Darwin, and we can talk spinning off universes wherein maybe we get back to the dice.  Where not locked into one of the above, or other categories, I think the man-on-the-street’s concept works for me.  Now you’ve got me interested in Benford & Zipf.  But first I gotta pick up all the branches the wind blew down this week.  “… after enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.”\nThanks for reading.  I’ll check out your writings.\n\n","date":"September 8, 2012 at 2:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/08/a-curmudgeon-what-if-another-god-next-to-him-is-doing-a-different-simulation/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Curmudgeon: What if another God next to him is doing a different simulation?"}]}
