{"blood":[{"author":"ronald_dennis_chism_(the_tomb_master)","post":"WHOA!!  Look at the lengthy exchanges that my PRIVATE [or so I’d thought!!] email to Mr. Porter generated.  I’M IMPORTANT!!!   LOL!!!Yes, I am the author of the email that you guys have been SO gracious to pay so much attention to, thus bestowing upon my…ahem…wholly unworthy self, such honor!!  Oh, lest anyone think that I have been trying to HIDE, or DUCK, for some subterranean reason, let me introduce myself:My name is Ronald Dennis ChismI’m not Jewish.  I just LIKE the term, “Oy vey,” because I have YET to find a term, anywhere, that SO expresses that special kind of frustration that, I’ve noticed, can only be expressed by COMPETENT speakers of Yiddish.  And I’m NOT that competent.I am NOT, as I said, a professional scientist, and I’m not ANY kind of scientists.  There was no attempt, on my part, to [ahem, JOHN] suggest anything by using the word “hire,” as regards Barry’s participation in the STURP studies.  Hired, JOINED, whatever.  I certainly was not using the term “hired” as meaning ANYTHING other than that he was part of the team.  Yet, my apologies displaying…well, WHATEVER it is you think I was trying to display.No, I’m not Jewish, ALTHOUGH I have been TOLD that black people of the United States are the descendants of the “original,” ancient Israelites all “white” Jews in Israel must, poste haste, LEAVE that land and make room for US [Uh…No, I DO NOT subscribe to that idea, in part because the IDF has proven to posses some of the BAAAAAADEST cats on the planet, and I have NO desire whatsoever to tangle with THEM.  In addition, as a somewhat “former” martial artist, I am aware that a Jewish guy won, THREE YEARS IN A ROW, the annual, underground, fight-to-the-death martial arts contest, sometimes held in…Well, I suppose I shouldn’t reveal that here.]Anyway, I have MUCHO respect for the Jewish warriors that would not think to kindly of my going to Jerusalem, and “re-claiming” my “rightful” home as an “original” black Jew.  Naw, John, no big deal.  I just LIKE the term, “Oy vey.”  I think it’s cool!!Now, for a little background, before I reveal some more “startling” information about…ahem…my august self, that has been able to draw so much attention from such a distinguished crowd of Santa Sindone researchers, Santa Sindone enthusiasts [Hey, Barry!!  Long time no rap!!]I was born and raised in Chicago, on Chicago’s south side.  Although my carpenter dad was not into religion, he sent me to Catholic school, because, back then, Catholic school was considered to offer a superior “education” than public school.I LOVED my Catholic/Christian religion.  For 8 years I attended Corpus Christ Grammar school, under the watchful…ahem…”CARE” of Fransiscan nuns, that would, BEAT YO ASS, just for not placing your winter boots directly under your coat, in the “cloak room.”  IN FACT, with my own eyes, in the 8th grade, I witnessed Sister Mary Teresita [I omit her real name] WHUP, and I mean OUT-BOX, the baadest cat on the south side of Chicago, whose name I shall also omit.  Well, after graduation, I attended Hales Franciscan High School, under the EQUALLY watchful care of Franciscan PRIESTS–another group of ass-kicking, GREAT scholars, that didn’t take crap from students.  Something happened along the way, in my Catholic sojourn: COMMON SENSE.  I believed the doctrine–totally.  But, in the 7th grade, something wasn’t making sense.  It was not until my Junior year in high school that I faced what was OBVIOUS, with regard to that Jewish guy whose Jewish mamma gave him [for some reason] a GREEK name: “Jesus Christ,” probably actually known as Yehoshuwah, or Yeshuwah.What did I discover?“And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you [Shalom Alaikum]. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed [SUPPOSED]  that they had seen a spirit. And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And he took it, and did eat before them. [The Bible].Now, I didn’t “discover” that verse.  I had known that verse, inside and out, all of my Catholic life, from kindergarten, all the way up to when I FINALLY read the verses, AS THEY WERE, without attaching anything supernatural to them.  The more I questioned those Franciscan priests, the more I realized that I had been sold FALSEHOOD.  The had no decent answers, relying instead on doctrines that made no sense whatsoever.  I have never needed the Santa Sindone, or any such artifact, to conclude what was RIGHT THERE IN THE BIBLE (Read the verses again).   “Hey, dudes, IT’S ME!  I survived!  And I’m HUNGRY!!  Ya’ll got anything to eat?  Lemme tell ya, being CRUCIFIED will leave ANYONE famished!”Right there in the Bible, DE-MYSTIFIED, was a truth that I had ignored, for all of those years, as a Catholic.  He had survived.  No Shroud needed.  No tomb of Jesus in Kashmir needed.  The testimony supporting his survival was right there in the Bible.  And the stuff about “rising up to heaven” is something you should probably talk to Dr. Thomas Sheehan about, as well as other Christian scholars that KNOW BETTER, and have openly stated that, as per their intense studies, the “rising to heaven” stuff was what they call a “pious embellishment” [We would have called it something ELSE, in MY old neighborhood].Now, continuing.  After having “discovered,” in my Bible, that “Jesus Christ,” the Jewish guy with the Greek name, had survived the Crucifixion, I decided that I wanted to know MORE, and that I would commit a portion of my life to finding out WHAT ELSE was out here that the Catholics had LIED about.And I found The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, now called The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.  And I JOINED that Movement in the year 1976.  So, hey, I have nothing to hide.  I didn’t need Ahmadiyyat to tell me that the Jewish guy with the Greek name had survived the crucifixion.  I’d ALREADY discovered that simply by reading my Bible!!What Ahmadiyyat did was SPELL IT OUT; Ahmadiyyat went deeper, its founder, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, performing his own, independent studies, and reporting on those studies in a book entitled, Masih Hindustein Mein (Messiah in India), later, in 1939, translated, in the English language, to Jesus in India.In time, I created The Tomb of Jesus Christ Website (www.tombofjesus.com), which was the first, super lengthy website dealing with the theory that the Jewish guy with the Greek name had survived the crucifixion, and made his way to India.Oh, you mean you DIDN’T KNOW that Flavius Josephus had reported that he witnessed a crucifixion victim SURVIVE that ordeal??  Here is what he said:“”I was sent by Titus Caesar with Ceralius and a thousand riders to a certain town by the name of Thecoa to find out whether a camp could be set up at this place. On my return I saw many prisoners who had been crucified, and recognized three of them as my former companions. I was inwardly very sad about this and went with tears in my eyes to Titus and told him about them. He at once gave the order that they should be taken down and given the best treatment so they could get better. However two of them died while being attended to by the doctor; the third recovered.” (Flavius Josephus, Vita, IV, 75)No one’s trying to be sneaky.  My interest in the Santa Sindone occurred a LONG TIME ago, and I have no problem whatsoever acknowledging that I might have forgotten some things.  But one thing I DIDN’T forget: Barry Schwortz DID tell me that he had met with Adler, in Turin; that he had had tea, or lunch, or something with him; and that Adler had told him that NO TEST OF POST-MORTEM BLOOD had been performed.  Now, maybe he meant something that I didn’t understand, but that’s what he said to me.By the way, I’m cool with Barry.  Barry and I got along REAL well, for a short period of time, a long time ago, through email correspondence.  I got no beef with ANYBODY.  I have no agenda.  I’m a VERY lowly member of Ahmadiyyat, 65 years old, somewhat “retired” as it relates to “tabligh” (preaching, and all that).I am no longer a proselyte.  Those were my YOUNGER days.  I have no interest in tearing down Christianity.  Indeed, Christianity has done an EXCELLENT job of tearing ITSELF down, and without anyone’s help [Crusades,  Inquisition, house arrest, burning of “witches,” decapitation, CHATTEL SLAVERY (one of the slave ships that brought my people to America was called, “The Good Ship Jesus.”  HELLO!!!]So, CARRY ON, good people!!  My wife just called, and I told her how much I’ve been HONORED here, and she burst out laughing–Oh, not at YOU!  But, only because she knows that I LOVE to see folks duking it out over alleged 2,000-year-old artifacts [It’s my hobby].Look, I’m not making lite of YOU guys, but I think that SOME of you are a bit too serious, making charges against other people, etc.Last, I repeat for emphasis: I discovered the truth about the Jewish guy with the Greek name IN HIGH SCHOOL, and I did so by reading the Bible.Now, whether or not the Santa Sindone is the cloth that covered him?  I have NO IDEA whatsoever.  All I did, as not even a good amateur, was ASK A FEW QUESTIONS, that’s all. But, I do appreciate the LOVE that you all have extended to me.  It’s HARD, these days, for a black man to get some LOVE, what with a bunch of us being SHOT TO DEATH IN THE STREETS, here in my country.Uh oh…Who’s that standing on my porch…Some….some guy….WITH A GUN!!!  WAIT….DON’T SHOOT!!!!! Hey, look, if you can’t laugh, in THIS world, you’re in SAD SHAPE!!As we used to say in the ’60s,PEACE OUT!!Your loving trouble-maker,Ronald Dennis Chism, formerly known as,The Tomb Master (Because of my single-handed authorship–and yes I’m proud of it–of The Tomb of Jesus Christ Website).","date":"August 29, 2015 at 4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!  We’ve got a problem?"},{"author":"ronald_dennis_chism_(the_tomb_master)","post":"To David & John:Perhaps I have been a bit too humble.  And perhaps because of that, you have made assumptions.It is quite clear to me that, either both of you have not caught my hint, or you choose to ignore it.  I tried to crawl out of this discussion, explaining that I had written a PRIVATE email to Mr. Porter, which he chose (without my permission) to post.  Secondly, I explained, or hinted, that, years ago, I sat at one of the very CENTERS of this discussion, having worked with Professor Fida Hassnain, former Director of Archives, Archaeology, Research and Museums, for the Indian state of Kashmir.   I have written a book on this subject entitled, “Saving the Savior: Did Christ Survive the Crucifixion.”  I have written a large website on this subject, entitled, The Tomb of Jesus Christ Website.  I am familiar with many things that, I am 100% certain, NONE of you are familiar with, including ancient documents, including CHRISTIAN documents, such as The Acta Thomae, that stand as testimony to the FACT that the man kinown as “Jesus Christ” did  survive the crucifixion.I’m sorry if I sound arrogant, but I have done a form of research that none of you have, and I can say that with confidence.  And UNLESS you have done the research that I have done, then it is utterly impossible for you to engage in an exchange with me, nor I with you.  It’s just not possible, because I would have to reproduce a voluminous amount of information, and it can’t be done at a little blog.For one thing, most of you are Christians, as it seems.  And, for you [FOR YOU] the authoritative account of the life of “Jesus Christ” is the Bible and ONLY the Bible.  That is not the case for me.  Not at all.  I am not a Christian.  As such, I am not bound by the Bible.  What I have done, in my DECADES of research, is use the Bible as ONE source.  And I have to do that, because the Bible is flawed.  It cannot be relied upon as the SOLE source of information on Jesus, or anything else for that matter.  So, some of the information about “Jesus,” in the Bible is correct.  And some of it is flawed beyond expression.  Having DISCOVERED those flaws, a long time ago, I set out to find OTHER information about Jesus, though not discarding that information, in the Bible, that HAPPENS to be correct.  And, yes, one HAS to “pick and choose,” in this manner, because the Bible has been tampered with, mis-translated, INTERPOLATED.  Entire BOOKS of the Bible were taken out by “inspired” (criminal), so-called “Fathers” of the Church.  So, the Bible is very far from an authoritative account of the life of the figure known as “Jesus.”  It takes lots of detective work to round out the life of Jesus, and that work involves reading Christian (including so-called “apocryphal”) accounts, as well as non-Christian (Buddhist accounts, accounts from Sanatana Dharma (“Hinduism”), accounts from other cultures, in other languages (Persian, Sanskrit, Urdu, etc.)If you have not read, or at least gained some familiarity with [and these are NOT Ahmadiyya books),The Bhavishya Mahapurana.The oral traditions of The Followers of Jesus, of AfghanistanThe Rauzat-us-SafaIkmal-ud-DinThe Book of Balauhar & Budasaf (Yuz Asaf)The Tariikh-i-KashmirThe Tarikh-i-Kabir-i-KashmirThe History of Religions and DoctrinesThe Wajees-ut-TawarikhThe Bagh-i-Sulaiman (Garden of Solomon)The Official Decree of the Grand Mufti of KashmirThe Acta ThomaeThe Ain-ul-HayatThe inscriptions of the Takhat Sulaiman monument,then you are not in a position to have a discussion with me.  It’s not possible.  You have not done the necessary homework that is NEEDED in order to get a more complete picture of the life of Jesus.  And, since you’re bound by your Christian doctrine, which means your Christian texts, you are LOCKED.  You will not allow yourself to reach OUTSIDE of Christian references, because you believe the Bible, and other Christian references, to be THE authority on the life of “Jesus Christ.”  This is incorrect.  And there’s NO WAY I can reduce DECADES of my life, 376 pages of my book, my correspondence with Dr. Hassnain, Aziz Kashmiri, and others; work with such scholars as Suzanne Olsson, Arif Khan, and others.By the way, if you are offended by my ETHNICITY that’s YOUR problem, not mine, and you NEED to get a grip.  I speak freely, as a MAN, not somebody’s BOY.  Nobody is going to tell me how to SPEAK.  I learned VERY WELL how to speak the “Kang’s” language, from FRANCISCAN priests and nuns.  I am very competent with the English language.But I’m a BLACK MAN, and neither YOU nor anyone else is going to tell me to NOT speak from my culture.  Nobody rules me.  Those days NEVER EXISTED–not in MY life, anyway.  My dad’s middle name was ANDALUSIA.  I don’t expect you to understand what I’m alluding to.I’m not some ideologue that was handed a tract, on the street, about Ahmadiyyat, and then, eyes wide opened like some CULTIST, began MEMORIZING and repeating ideology.  No.  I RESEARCHED, and I did so for decades.I’m no longer in the game, though.  I sent Mr. Porter a PRIVATE EMAIL, and I was VERY surprised when he posted my PRIVATE email.  I was informed by Arif Khan that my PRIVATE email had been posted here.  That’s the only reason I posted anything here: to clarify.When I saw all the conversation that that PRIVATE email had caused, I decided to ENJOY myself [MY choice, not yours], and respond.One of you talked to me about how serious this subject is.  OH???  REALLY???  You have NO idea how serious it is, NONE of you.  It’s way more than just religion and spirituality.  You won’t understand this, but I’ll say it anyway.  The belief that Jesus “died on the cross for the sins of the world” is DIRECTLY responsible for that sheet of debris, in one of our oceans, that’s the size of TEXAS.  The very manner in which Euro-man developed his science; his attitutde to LIFE; to nature, is directly influenced by his DISCONNECTION from The Divine, and his deification of a simple human being.Paul (the renegade!!) is perhaps the biggest TRAITOR to human progress that ever existed.  He destroyed the SIMPLE message of Yuz Asaf (Jesus); He ripped the SOUL out of humanity, and placed The Most High way, way at a DISTANCE from humanity.Paul is DIRECTLY (you won’t see this either) responsible for the eventual creation of THE SLAVE TRADE, which managed, as a consequence, to make BOTH of my uncles ALCOHOLICS!!!!  Both my uncles, and my mother and father DIED as a result of their natural rhythms being snatched away from them by SICK, so-called “Christians” that didn’t know that God was INSIDE of them, as Jesus had said:“The Kingdom of God is inside of you.”So, don’t you DARE tell ME about how “serious” this discussion is, sir, because you don’t even have a CLUE.  The very philosophies that developed as a REACTION to Church-Christianity have wreaked havoc on the world.  Your Christian “god” RUINED the world.  Christianity ripped the very SOUL out of planet earth, and out of the collective consciousness of humanity.I know way more than you could ever imagine, or that you have ever thought about, and I say that with 100% confidence.  My people, to THIS day, are suffering on account of YOUR sick, Christian doctrine, that raised a simple human being to the Godhead.  Two black slaves were taken to the Pope, and he “blessed” the Slave Trade.  That’s Christianity for you.  No, not the TRUE Christianity that Jesus talked about, which the Church DESTROYED.  The True Christianity would never have spawned the Slave Trade; would never have arrested Galileo; would never have condemned the Jews, for TWO-THOUSAND YEARS, for a “crime” that Christianity said was supposed to happen ANYWAY: The “death” of “Jesus Christ” for the “sins” of the world.I have paid BIG dues–dues none of you have paid.  So, how can there be any exchange?  And THAT was my HINT!!  I tried to allow you guys to continue your scientific discussions (limited as they are, since you have only a tiny picture of “Jesus,” and have not gone beyond the few documents of the Church).Yeah, you’re right!  It’s a SERIOUS subject.  And such a serious subject cannot properly be debated at some blog.  Books on the historicity of Jesus go back to the 1700s.  How am I supposed to come here and “discuss” anything.Besides, i dropped out of this subject about 13 years ago.  I gave The Tomb of Jesus Christ Website to Awais Khan, of Canada, and Arif Khan is the official editor of that site.  I SHO NUF ain’t gonna get back into this.  I”m gone gwine on on ’bout my BIZness [and if you don’t like my “ethnic” talk, that’s YOUR problem, no mine.  Talking “ethnic” doesn’t mean I’m not INTELLIGENT, or that I can’t carry on a conversation, or debate, using the “Kang’s” English].The Santa Sindone is ONE piece of circumstantial evidence, and the jury is still out.  We can see this from the fact that SOME coroners claim that the Man of the Shroud was DEAD.  Others claim that the markings, stains, images, etc., in the Santa Sindone “prove” that he was alive.  My conclusion regarding “Jesus” is NOT based solely on interpretations of studies on the Santa Sindone.  My conclusions are based on the GOOD DETECTIVE work of those that came before me, as well as my own detective work.There IS no smoking gun, yet, unless the Rozabal is opened, and we find something definite.  What we have are a LOT of pieces of circumstantial evidence, that, taken together, prove that Jesus survived.  You guys are not familiar with all that evidence, so you’re limited.The evidence goes from Jerusalem to Syria to Persia to Afghanistan to India to Tibet, to Kashmir, and even to China.  In a court of law, accumulated circumstantial evidence can be MORE decisive than the smoking gun.  The smoking gun is there next to the body.  No finger prints.  But!!!  Detectives discover:1. The gun is registered to John Doe2. John doe BRAGGED, in front of 50 people, in a bar, that he was going to blow his wife’s head off on April 25th, 1975; that he was going to purchase a ticket to Paris, and stay in a certain hotel.3. The detectives go to the gunshop, from which the gun was purchased, and the salesman says, “Yeah, when the guy came in here, he said he was going to blow his wife’s head off, and he then smiled.  I thought he was joking.”Well, that’s enough.  John Doe is going to the slammer.That’s how the historicity of “Jesus” has to be approached.  The Bible AIN’T enough.  The Santa Sindone AIN’T enough.  But, once you have TAKEN THE TIME to read ALL of the evidence; examined ALL of the accumulated, circumstantial evidence, it is THEN and ONLY then that we can have a conversation.PROMISE; I’m OUTTA here!!  And I won’t be back, no matter how much anyone tries to goad me into responding.This was a BIG mistake, coming here, and I should have known better.  Last, do not assume that my particular way of communicating is indicative of how Ahmadi Muslims communicate.  Some Ahmadi Muslims will be DISPLEASED at how I’ve talked, but that’s THEIR problem.  I never claimed to be anybody’s example of anything.But I DO say this: “Jesus Christ” is dead and buried in the Rozabal structure.  His sarcophagus lies UNDER that structure, underground, and could once be seen by a small aperture on the side of the building.  The facade sarcophagus on the ground level of that structure is just that–a facade.  The story of his survival; his travels; and his SUCCESSFUL end of his life–teaching, marrying, having children, is a WONDERFUL story ahd truth.  His prayers were answered–those prayers that he prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, that God SPARE him from the coming ordeal.His prayers were answered.  And you’ll discover that IF you’re interested in taking the time to crawl out of your LIMITED, Christian references, and go out into the world and follow the trail.  You’ll find it.  You don’t have to be a scholar, either.  But you DO have to be FEARLESS, and have a strong desire to find the truth.  Selah.Yours,Willie Bobo,The King of 47th Street(“Say it loud!!
