The scriptures tells us that we must become like little children if we are to enter into the glory He has prepared for us. Isn’t it amazing that God has revealed himself to two beautiful children and they are sharing their stories with the world. I pray God’s blessings on each person that reads Heaven is for Real and sees the portrait of the Prince of Peace. I also pray the Holy Spirit will convict the heart of each non believer as they experience these stories. My Jesus is real. Hallelujah!!!!.","date":"2011-10-25","mins":"1:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
