{"art":[{"author":"janeen","post":"I can tell you this:  If one is truly saved and belongs to Jesus, God hears every prayer you utter!  Does He answer every prayer in your timing, the way you want it answered.  My experience is this.  Never in my timing but His. Jesus desires to bless me because He is just that sweet and kind.  He knows the desires of my heart.  My tastes.  He made me that way.  If I’m living for Him He bless me with the earthly “things” I like.  Did he prevent my Dad from dying when I begged him.  No.  It’s not the job of the created to dictate to the creator like a cosmic vending machine to do things our way.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2011 at 11:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
