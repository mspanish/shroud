{"researchers":[{"author":"jon","post":"Perhaps, the shroud of Turin is like the Tilma of Juan Diego where the image of the Virgin Mary was imprinted. Considering that the tilma still exist to this day and did not rot, it could be said that it is alive. When alive, plants absorbed radio carbon and stop only when it died whence radio carbon decay. This is the basic principle of carbon dating. Now if the shroud is alive up to the date when it was first exposed to public then it was only at that date where the linen (derived from plant) has its radio carbon start to decay. Consequently, the carbon dating will point to the said date, which was the one observed in the radio carbon dating experiment. This can support the belief that the shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus.
