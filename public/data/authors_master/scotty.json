{"forensic":[{"id":"comment-8040","author":"scotty","post":"I am no scientist, but I live life with healthy objectivity. My humble conclusion? The Son of The Almighty God was here, thus validating the New Testament….and Old. I feel priveledged. I know much, (through researching REAL scientist’s findings…and non findings), about the most important THING on the planet. The longer I live, the more I understand I am sharing this wonderful planet with the 99% who are galactically ignorant, gullible, and mis informed. I believe it was a vanishing event which “crossed” the physical matter into other dimensions. New Testament has the risen Christ transfiguring his physical appearance as well as moving into locked rooms, and disappearing again. Citizens of Earth, please examine the evidence and conclude that the long haired, bearded guy, from WAY before the 14th century, is the prophesied Messiah. True scientists of the world, thank you. Please continue deeper into the cosmos, and into the realms of the tiniest particulate matter…and anti matter(?) Archeologists, keep digging and getting those fingernails dirty! You are all hero’s to me. He encourages us to “seek me as you would a treasure”. Einstein admitted that the universe is not only more incredible than we can imagine, but more incredible than we could EVER imagine. Christianity, to myself, is no longer a “religion”. I find that word belittles the Faith. Christianity is the following of a real and living entity….the following of my Brother whom I look up to and want proud of me…similarly, as the Father is proud of Him. Make no mistake, citizens. Our lives are scrutinized every day.
