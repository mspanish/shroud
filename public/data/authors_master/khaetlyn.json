In fact, if you look at the blog post to which you are referring, you will notice that I was quoting a biblical website. I provided the link to that site in the blog post. If you care about intellectual honesty, please clarify that I did not say anything about the shroud, I merely quoted another website. Thanks, Khaetlyn Grindell.","date":"2012-03-24","mins":"5:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/29/did-jesus-eat-fish-not-according-to-the-shroud-of-turin-go-figure/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Did Jesus Eat Fish?
