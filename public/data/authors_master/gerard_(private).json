I enjoyed it very much. I also found the video Science tests faith on youtube. It features Mike Willasee who was a well know athiest during his time on Aust TV. He was a premiere tabloid journo & peddler of the usual bile we’re all familiar with.To say he’s had a conversion on the road to Damascus is an understatement! He explains his scepticsm & conversion back to Catholicism in the video as well as their methodology & evidence. Well worth a look if you’re sceptical. He was a very hard nosed Christopher Hitchens type before his conversion.YoutubeScience tests faithPosted by SandritaRowan26","date":"September 23, 2013 at 12:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/23/the-eucharistic-miracle-of-buenos-aires/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Eucharistic Miracle of Buenos Aires"}]}
