{"art":[{"author":"kl_oxford","post":"If you look at the Pray Manuscript in closer detail, you actually see decorative holes everywhere.....from the clothing of the angels﻿ and the other people in the picture.......and if you take a look at the supposed \"shroud\" in the picture........there are more holes than just the 4 that form the \"L Shape\".This strongly suggest that the holes in the supposed shroud in the picture are nothing to with the L shaped burn holes at all!Furthermore you won;t actually see the \"herringbone\" pattern on the shroud unless your are very close up to it........so it's unlikely the artist would put the herringbone pattern in his picture.Imagaine I drew a TV picture onto a page.......I would ONLY see the tiny pixels when I am close up to the screen......so I am highly unlikely to draw a rectangle with small square pixels.....why on Earth would this artist draw the herring bone pattern if you can only see it close up?What about the closes of the other people......when viewed close up you would see various inticate patterns and stitchings.....but we don't see that in the picture.....and what about close up views of the bodies you would see body and facial hair on the skin.......how come this isn't in the picture but the herringbone pattern is?THE only conclusion you can really draw from this is that the Pray Manuscript is NOT very strong proof at all as regards to the Turin Shroud dating.","date":"April 9, 2012 at 12:42 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2010/01/shroud-of-turin-z-pray-manuscript.html","title":"The Pray Manuscript (or Codex)"}]}
