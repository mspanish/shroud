Here is my understanding how the invisible weave got started. I’m sure Joe, can certainly add any details or revision if needed to my version. “I had the pleasure speaking with Dr. Kohlbeck on August 26th 2011. I contacted him so I could ask him if he had any knowledge of the Raes thread. He explained to me that he had no knowledge of Dr. Nitowski’s claim that the thread was switched. We then began to discuss the red particles. Dr. Kohlbeck explained to me that Sue Benford contacted him and requested if he could send her his microscopic photographs of the lance wound area where Dr. Kohlbeck made his observation. (6 BF). She explained to him that she believes what Dr. Heller thought was blood is actually the gum,dye,mordant coating which Dr. Kohlbeck simply referred in his findings as Starch. Sue Bedford continued to explain the invisible weave theory to which Dr. Kohlbeck found to be very fascinating. He further explained that Sue Bedford’s thesis was very plausible, and would easily concede that the blood was in fact dye madder supporting the invisible mending theory”.
