I placed a blanket on my head there was an 8-inch gap of where my face would have touched the front and where my head would have touched the back.  Looking at the PHOTOs there is less than 2 inches.  This is also depicted in most of the artwork that I've seen.  I do not doubt that there was one at some time in the past.  I would just like someone to explain the lack of distance between the face and the back.\n\n","date":"October 3, 2007 at 8:34 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2007/09/shroud-news-august-2007.html","title":"\nShroud News - August 2007\n"}]}
