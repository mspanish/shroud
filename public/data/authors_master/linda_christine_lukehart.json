I know Jesus wants everyone to know him and come to the father.  I was so moved by the things the boy remembered.  I am looking forward to seeing Jesus soon.  I too thought the picture would match up with the Shroud, am glad to see others feel the same.\nJesus is coming soon, look to Him for your salvation,  He is the only way.  Love to all.\n\n","date":"September 1, 2011 at 8:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"linda_christine_lukehart","post":"I agree with you, Christ is coming soon.
