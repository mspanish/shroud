In his second and latest book, “Erasing Death: The Science That Is Rewriting the Boundaries Between Life and Death” includes an update on his AWARE study, but I found nothing new in it as far as this study goes. \nSome people claim that during this NDE they float above their bodys and look down and see what the doctors are doing. And one of the things they have done in the four year study is place signs high up so the only way you can see them if is that you are floating up above. So far there is no claim that someone has reported seeing them.\nThere are a lot of problems with the claim that people have seen the afterlife. Some people see Jesus, or whatever god they believe in, some see friends that are still alive and sometimes kid meet a man in a red suit (maybe Santa).Many people see Jesus and Jesus allows them to Judge themself rather than have God do it as in the Bible.\nAfter all the book I’ve read on this on this subject I now believe it’s something that’s is created in the mind but I’ll await the final release of the study(which we been promised for years) before I make up my mind.\nPS Some Christains believe that this is the work of the Devil (Well, NDE’s not my post) because some bad people go to heaven and sometimes good people go to hell.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2014 at 9:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"john_green","post":"Well I agree.

The ancient writing tells the story of how the god Enki warns a Sumerian king named Atra-Hasis of a future flood that will destroy mankind; Enki gives him instructions for building a boat to save his family and livestock. If that sounds like a familiar tale, it’s because this was one of several ancient flood traditions that, centuries later, would inspire the biblical story of Noah. But the tablet’s inscription describes a boat very different from the traditional image of the Ark—it’s said to be circular and made of reeds. Is this nothing more than a fanciful myth? Or could such a reed boat have carried Atra-Hasis’ family of more than one hundred and his many animals?

His book, “Our Mathematical Universe” has been well received by people like Brian Greene and Michio Kaku, in fact Kalu wrote this about his book;\n“Daring, Radical. Innovative. A game changer. If Dr. Tegmark is correct, this represents a paradigm shift in the relationship between physics and mathematics, forcing us to rewrite our textbooks. A must read for anyone deeply concerned about our universe.” —Prof. Michio Kaku, author of Physics of the Future \nThe back cover of his books says that he is the author or coauthor of more than 200 technical papers, twelve of which have been cited more than 500 times. He is also a well respected professor at MIT. He may be right or wrong, but he’s no idiot.    \nWhat I see is that Penrose and Hameroff are saying that consciousness just a normal physical property of the brain not unlike V. S.

I took her all over trying to cure her and one day I was in a book store and found a book by Linus Pauling(Nobel Prizes) about using vitamin c for cancer. In the book he explained how vitamin c cures cancer and gave many cases where he said it work, but also cases that failed. Well he made excuse after excuse about why it didn’t work and that set off a flag, but I continued to believe in Pauling. I called his research lab in CA and I get this doctor with a heavy German accent. I explain my dog’s problem and he says to me, “Maybe it’s time for the Final Solution.” I was a little in shock, seems I heard that somewhere before, but he agrees to tell me how to treat my dog. \nLong story short, the dog died and Pauling continued claiming vitamin c cures cancer, then his wife died (of cancer) and then he died (of cancer). \nSo I respect the works of Penrose and Hameroff (I have their books) but I also respect the opinions of others. Now I’m going to go wait for the last snow of this year (I hope).\n\n","date":"March 20, 2015 at 10:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"author":"john_green","post":"I forgot this \nhttps://www.facebook.com/UNHDrLee\nhttp://www.henryleeinstitute.com/\n\n","date":"March 16, 2015 at 6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"author":"john_green","post":"Charles\nThings like blood and DNA break down over time.

He assumed superpositions of solitons separated from themselves by a distance of 24 nanometers along the length of the microtubule. As previously described, superposition separation in Orch OR is at the Fermi length level of atomic nuclei, i.e. 7 orders of magnitude smaller than Tegmark’s separation value, thus underestimating decoherence time by 7 orders of magnitude, i.e. from 10−13 s10−13 s to microseconds at 10−610−6 seconds. Hagan et al. [162] used Tegmark’s same formula and recalculated microtubule decoherence times using Orch OR stipulations, finding 10−410−4 to 10−310−3 seconds, or longer. In any case, experimentally, Bandyopadhyay’s group has found 10 kHz resonance, i.e. 10−410−4 seconds coherence times.

Right now I’m studying the Kashmir Shaivism school of EP. \nIn his book, “Consciousness is Everything” Swami Shankarananda he tells us that Kashmir Shaivism teaches us that there is only consciousness and that it’s the only substance in the universe. Everything that appears different is just consciousness vibrating at a particular frequency and behaving in a specific way ( sound like string theory or Penrose?). Everything is one. To them Shiva, the divine being, is consciousness itself. And we are all a part of the divine. The divine is in all of us? Isn’t that what Mat 25:35-40 telling us? \nYou can replace Shiva with Jesus if you like.

Is it an illusion like some claim consciousness is?  Just neurons firing? We don’t know! Oh and how many neuron connections do we need before something is conscious?  Is a fruit fly conscious? Do we need neurons at all? Is the universe itself conscious? Is what Sir James Jeans said, “the universe begins to look more like a great thought than a great machine.”  Is that true?\n\n","date":"April 27, 2015 at 5:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/25/flat-earth-society-shroud-of-turin-research-project-sturp-and-other-partisans/","cat":"article","title":"Flat Earth Society, Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and Other Partisans"},{"author":"john_green","post":"Louis\nHinduism is clearly a religion unless you want to redefine the meaning of religion. Go to Amazon and type in “World Religions” and you will find books which that list Hinduism as a religion. The Norton Anthology of World Religions list Hinduism as a religion. \nChristains believe God revealed things to them and Lord Sliva is claimed to have revealed Tantra to them. Neither one of them can prove a god revealed anything so if that’s the test both are philosophy.\nNow remember I am talking about, Kashmir Shavism and for me I agree that’s a philosophy more than a religion.\nhttp://www.themovementcenter.com/about/philosophical-foundations/\nKashmir Shaivism\n“The practitioners of nondualistic Kashmir Shaivism came to view the world as absolute Consciousness, which they called Shiva. This Consciousness, being both one and free, creative and self-reflective, was revealed as the fundamental I, or Divine Self. Thus, Kashmir Shaivism emphasizes the inner Self. The systematic growth of Kashmir Shaivism unfolded as practitioners reflected on the nature of the highest reality, describing it as pure Consciousness.”\nI have not read anything by Wendy Doniger yet. I looked on Amazon and read some of the reviews about her book, “On Hinduism.”  It has 48% 1 stars and only 21% 5 stars. She is a Professor of Religions so I don’t dismiss her and since I like to read all sides of an issue maybe I’ll read her book, but right now I’m into the Yoga of .Kashmir Shaivism\nNow if the Shourd is proven to be authentic that would put it in a new ball park. I don’t know either way but I kind of like the Kashmir Shaivism idea that the person before me, like me, is part of the divine. And if I can suppress the ego I can find self and the divine within me.\n\n","date":"April 27, 2015 at 11:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/25/flat-earth-society-shroud-of-turin-research-project-sturp-and-other-partisans/","cat":"article","title":"Flat Earth Society, Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and Other Partisans"},{"author":"john_green","post":"Louis\nReligion:\n: the belief in a god or in a group of gods\n: an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies, and rules used to worship a god or a group of gods\n: an interest, a belief, or an activity that is very important to a person or group\nI think Hinduism falls under that.\nNext, you can have a philosophy of life with no god or gods. My beleif system is a philosophy so I agree on that point. \nNext, Chistains also has many schools of interpretations and they can’t even agree what books should be in the Bible.\nNext, The Bible also has man many, many contradictions.\nNext, The God of the OT was a;also a god of destruction. Remember the claimed flood? Remember all the times God told the jews to go over here and kill these people? Now go over here and kill those people. Oh and Sliva is also the restorer.        \nI’ve Just added “Return to the Centre” to my Amazon wish list. I think there is about 300 books on it so it may take a while. But it looks interesting so thanks for suggesting that.\nI studied the bible and all the subject about is for about 30 years. I use to read all the debates in Biblical Archaeology Review. I’ve read the Nag Hammadi Library many times(I find the Coptic Gospel of Thomas very interesting). All this made me an agnostic. Many years ago I was debated Christian on the internet. Some of the debates were that the earth is 5 or 10 thousands years ago, dinasaurs and humans walked the earth together, maybe they got that from the flintstones, etc.. That turned me into an agnostic with atheist leanings. I started studying Eastern Philosophy only a few years ago so I’m still new to this. Now I’m a agnostic with Eastern Philosophy leanings.\nHaving a philosophy allows me to pick from many areas. And it allows me to look at the Shroud without at this time to a belief system.\n\n","date":"April 27, 2015 at 9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/25/flat-earth-society-shroud-of-turin-research-project-sturp-and-other-partisans/","cat":"article","title":"Flat Earth Society, Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and Other Partisans"},{"author":"john_green","post":"Louis\nMaybe you missed it in my first post on this. I repeat, “I don’t believe in their gods, or that we are born again but this helps me understand the Bible better.”\nI can pick apart things they believe in and I can do the same for what Christains believe in. \nWhat you are saying is as wrong as if I was to say the Catholic Church believes it ok for priest to have sex with young boys and they will just cover it up. \nAnd guess what a Christain nation ruled India untill 1947, shall we blame them for all the problems india on Christains? How about all the suffering evil people caused in the name of Christ, does the  Spanish Inquisition  ring a bell?\nLouis give us your data that supports your claim that believing believing that the person before me, like me, is part of the divine is the reason for so much suffering in India. \nUsing you logic I could never lose at the race tract because I noticed that every horse that wins has a jockey on it so all I have to do is bet every horse with a jockey.  \nKashmir Shaivism teachs that before you can come to the divine in you must get go beyond ego and come with love and forgiveness to others. How is that not Christ like? I don’t know where you are getting your information from, but it’s wrong.\nHere, how’s this;\n“One may amass wealth with hundreds of hands but one should also distribute it with thousands of hands.

Maybe that person kicking the begger was a Christain. \nIt appears you don’t understand the concept. To find the “inner self ” is to go beyond the ego, it’s the ego that causes all these problem, not the teachings.    \nJust because all Hindus don’t follow all the teachings of Hinduism does that make the teachings bad? Hey, guess what, not all Christians follow the teachings of the Bible, are the teachings wrong?  Isn’t that why Jesus came? \nYou do know that the peak of poverty in Indea was in the 1920’s under the rule of a Christian nation. Gandhi led the way to get rid of that Christain nations wrongs, oh and he was a Hindu.\nTHE USA is a claimed Christian nation. We have lot of people homeless, we bomb other people, Long at all the people we killed in that war in the 60’s. Children go to bed without food, we shot unarmed people, the 1% control almost everything.\nIndia is growmg fast, more and more people are getting jobs. India is very young under non Christian rule. When the USA started Christians owned blacks and beat and killed them. Oh and the KKK, the group that killed blacks at will was a Christain group. \nShall I can go on and on Louis. Shall I tell you how many, “Christains” commit horrible crimes all over the world? Shall I say that the teaching of Jesus theoretically sounds fine, but in practice it doesn’t work?  \nYou want to tell us what Jung said I can tell you what Bart D. Ehrman wrote. Why waste the time? Oh and Chriatians have contradictory beliefs also.\nLouis you may believe that only what you believe is valid, that’s fine. I don’t believe I and only I hold the truth and only my way is the right way. Many of the things I believe may be proven wrong.
