Did not the Apostles not believe until they saw the Risen Christ or the empty tomb? Did not St. Thomas not believe until Christ appeared before him? Did not Paul see Christ before he stopped persecuting and began preaching? What about the countless peoples who were brought to faith by seeing the miracles of the Apostles? I completely agree with daveb, that there are many things that can bring people to faith, and the Shroud of Turin is certainly one of them..","date":"2012-09-22","mins":"8:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/21/really-we-must-come-to-god-by-faith-not-by-sight/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Really?

It’s a developing relationship that grows over time in Christ; while one may need the Shroud to start, just as St. Thomas needed to see Christ himself, it can develop to the point where it will no longer need it..","date":"2012-09-22","mins":"9:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/21/really-we-must-come-to-god-by-faith-not-by-sight/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Really?

Flury Lemberg not participate in the election of the piece that was cut, so I could hardly know that area before. See the before and after on my blog: http://lasabanaylosescepticos.blogspot.com.es/2006/01/la zona de donde se cort.html [Photo of BEFORE is little known, I asked Dan to take it down to your blog but have not done] They are high resolution pictures you can see the dramatic deterioration in the cut for the C14, in addition to finding that was much higher than indicated NATURE (1 × 7 cm). There may be patches and anything you can think of ……….. We know also that the exact parts cut sample were sent to laboratories. Almost all the damaged part is no longer observed after cutting the sample, and badly so he could see Flury Lemberg. Bad choice on the court!

However, Marino responded to Madame Flury Lemburg (who claimed this herself) and explained that unless one was specifically looking for a French Invisible Re weave they were unlikely to find it. He backed this up with multiple authorities who explained the technique and how it is difficult to spot.
