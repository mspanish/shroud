Now, no NDE but, about one month after the operation I went thru a time of being full of appreciation for the healing hand of our Lord and for the power of prayer. This feeling was so full of goodness, I know the prayers of family and friends were answered. As so many of you have testified, our Lord Jesus Christ will someday return to save us all.
