Now I’m writing something for the youth.\nI’m trying to find an interview I saw only a handful of years ago on British TV. A man who was a serious skeptic who had been quite abusive to those who wouldn’t bend the knee to the skeptics after the C14 debacle was dying of throat cancer. It was virtually his last interview. I remember almost his exact words\n “The burden of proof is now on those who say the Shroud of Turin is not the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth”.\nCould you point me in the right direction to find this interview?\nCould you display on your website,please?\nCheers,\nPaul Sullivan\n\n","date":"November 6, 2012 at 4:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/26/barrie-schwortz-announces-latest-changes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-website-stera-inc/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz Announces Latest Changes to the Shroud of Turin Website (STERA, Inc.)"}]}
