The fishermen in John 21 were most likely about to give up, it was their livelyhood to fish , a very tough but rewarding life. They were most likely up before dawn, set the sails and went out to the sea to catch fish so that they could sell them and feed their families. Jesus had already been crucified and the disciples were back out fishing for fish……On this fine morning they were not catching anything and most likely at the point of giving up….\nHave you ever been in the position that you were about to give up, feeling that you were on the wrong side….or most likely on the good side and not seeing the fruits of your labor? Either at work or in your personal life? Giving up may be the easy route to go, but remember that Jesus is always there for you, listen to Him and he will guide you through…\nWell, Jesus instructed the Disciples, they listened.\nHe instructs you, He is always there for you,you just have to listen…\nJesus was there for the Disciples, instructed them because He know’s best, He knows where the Fish are…He is the best Fishfinder….\nHe knows what is right for you, He knows you, so listen to Him so that you end up on the Right Side Of A Good Thing.\nYour Brother in Christ,\nFisherman Al\n\n","date":"January 8, 2012 at 12:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
