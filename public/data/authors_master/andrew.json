{"opinion":[{"author":"andrew","post":"If AB negative blood type is the rarest to be found on earth, then I think you can expect the people to be rare as well. Blood is equal to the physical manifestation of life-force energy. Chinese say wherever there is bio-energy there is blood and vice-versa. Most likely there is a lot more to learn about the different blood types and what kind of people are represented by each than what we have discovered so far. Since the causes of birthmarks is still unknown it’s hard to speak at all about their significance. But I do believe that all things in life are connected and everything has purpose, even the smallest of things that exist. Perhaps the phoenix has special significance in your life. It is the symbol of death and rebirth- the ability to transform and to regenerate. Some people experience transformation on a much deeper level than others and can regenerate themselves well inwardly because they have a lot of inner knowledge instead of simply living on the surface with the bulk of society. Also some people experience this aspect in an outer way as well. Some people experience the death or loss of dear ones throughout their life in sudden and tragic ways, perhaps to learn about how to let go of other people. Not sure if any of it is fitting for you, but that is how I look at it","date":"June 4, 2013 at 10:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"}]}
