{"history":[{"author":"george_limacher","post":"There is no reaon not to believe the Shroud of Turin is a genuine burial shroud, it’s genuine of course;  but whether it is the shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ is the difficult question.  The Romans crucified many in exactly the same way and treatment as Our Lord Jesus Christ. So how are we going to know for sure, we can’t.  Many artifacts were obtained by the crusaders and much of these have later been considered as fakes. There is however a very good chance the real shroud was kept by our Blessed Mother Mary, and may still exist, somewhere in Turkey.","date":"April 21, 2011 at 9:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/23/shroud-exhibit-and-museum-in-new-mexico/","cat":"history","title":"Shroud Exhibit and Museum in New Mexico"}]}
