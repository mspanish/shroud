{"opinion":[{"id":"comment-12066","author":"jose","post":"From my point of view, the digital treatment of the image removing the banding effect cannot show neither that the fiber surface was not affected nor the presence of a coating. Simply it does not follow. If the bandig was due not to a coating but to a different characteristics of the fibers of the different batches of linen used to make the cloth (different growth conditions of those plants or different sun exposition etc…) this could also have led to a different intensity of the image in those fibers. The equalization process would also have removed this banding. Note that the equalization treatment just reduce the intensity of the image in those areas where it was more intense. The result is what you see in the pictures above. Therefore, this cannot say anything about a coating. That is why I cannot agree with Yannick when he says : “I think the FACT that there is a strong correlation between the intensity of the image and the intensity of the bands on the Shroud is well enough to understand that Rogers conclusion about the banding effect is PROBABLY CORRECT. And if it’s right, then that mean that his hypothesis concerning the thin layer of impurities is PROBABLY CORRECT TOO.” A coating is a possible explanation but not the only one for the banding..","date":"2012-06-07","mins":"2:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer"}]}
