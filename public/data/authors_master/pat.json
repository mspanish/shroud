{"art":[{"author":"pat","post":"It’s natural to fear the unknown but that fear can disappear as you look to the reality of what it means to leave this place and go on to heaven. It means you get Jesus. You get to be with HIM. HE is our destiny. HE is our hope and the love of our life. Cultivate THAT relationship, KNOW HIM and you will no longer fear death. Spend time with HIM in prayer and reading HIS WORD. Mother Teresa was a great example of devotion to Jesus. She constantly directed others to look to Him, seek Him. Jesus tells us to “Love the Lord Your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength.” And He continues with, “Love others as you love yourself.” Just focus your energies on Him.\n\n","date":"September 10, 2011 at 10:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
