{"researchers":[{"author":"brandykat","post":"\n\nIn my humble opinion, the Shroud of Turin is a hoax.  That's not to say it doesn't represent a great act of faith and in spite of itself hasn't become a religious relic anyway.  Still, the only questions left to science after much investigation is how the artwork on the shroud was actually painted.  Daubbed, brushed, whatever.  All this other stuff is just a point of argument and an excuse to publish another academic paper.  The real answer is very simple.Now, I believe the bible is just a master work of compiled collections of ancient writers.  But clearly the believers in the shroud are also believers in the bible as an accurate gospel of God and Jesus Christ, etc.  I have seen a few bible quotes in the debate about the shroud, but I rarely, if ever, see one in particular that I offer here.  How can the Shroud of Turin possibly be authentic when the bible reads thusly: John 20:3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. 4 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. 5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 7 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.The scripture clearly states that there were two pieces, with a separate piece around Jesus' head, and from what I understand common practive of the time.  That being the case, the image of Jesus' face would not be on the Turin shroud, or would at least appear differently from the rest of the fabric.  And the absense of folds, voids, and displacements in the image that would occur had the fabric been wrapped around a body further support the Shroud, not so much an intentional hoax, but a medieval work of art.\n\n","date":"June 14, 2008 at 11:49 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2008/03/shroud-news-january-2008.html","title":"\nShroud News - January 2008\n"}]}
