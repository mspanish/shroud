{"art":[{"author":"michael_wilks","post":"I had an experience 4 years ago. I wasnt feeling well so i layed down on the sofa. I remember my head spinning, then things went dark, then slowly there was a dim light and it started to grow brighter and brighter. Then i was walking in what seemed like clouds, i looked up and in front of me were these huge gates with scrolled designs all over it. Up in the left corner i saw what looked like a neon sign and it would fade from saying Heaven to fading out, then fade back and saying exit. I still dont understand that. I walked thru the gates and walked in these clouds, as i was walking i noticed more peoplle around me. Then suddenly i was pulled into what i still call a worm hole, i remember going realy fast in all sorts of directions, i could feel the wind on me and even the mist from clouds, and i remember lights flashing as i went thru. It was so awesome!! Then i was let down and standing in a street and there were hundreds of people walking along with me to a town just in front of us. I remember i saw my Grandmothers and Grandfathers and other family members. I remember my mom saying “I saw Judy Goodall, and she is so beautiful now” . (Judy was a friend that had passed away 12 years ago). I remember seeing my dad. And i remember seeing a man in a white robe walking along with us, somehow i knew who he was (Jesus). People were talking but i couldnt realy make out what they were saying. Then we were in a small town. I walked around it looking for my friend Rich, i went into stores, resturants, houses but couldnt find him. I remember sitting in this HUGE library and a big book was open on the table in front of me and i remember seeing names and dates. Then i got up went outside and thats when i realized how quiet it was, no car motors no horns no humming fans, you could hear birds chirping and dogs barking lightly. I walked up a small hill thru a beautiful park, then walked up to an old man operating a jackhammer, but it didnt make any noise. I asked him where i am and he said “Your neither here nor there, your in the land in between” (some how it made sense). I walked a little more just amazed at the unsual quiet and looking at how beautiful it was there. Then i woke up. I was covered in what looked like a light mist and gasping for breath. and i remember i wanted to go back to that place soooo badly.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2011 at 9:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"michael_wilks","post":"Annie~ My Sister-in-Law wondered the same thing, because of my symptoms for having to lay down. I really believe i went somewhere else.. there is more to my story. There was sooo much more i saw that day, i didn’t know how many words we could write on here  to tell of our experiences. To me i had to have left this world, because i never got to meet my Grandmother on my mothers side, she died a year before i was born. But i knew her face, i described her to my mom and mom started crying and told me that yes that was her. I remember there was the most awesome gold color to the sky, yet the clouds were such beautiful shades of blue and white. When i have time i will add more to this life changing experience i had.\n\n","date":"November 30, 2011 at 10:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"michael_wilks","post":"But if you remember the old man i talked to, told me i was “Inbetween” so that could easily explain the clouds where i was at. i dont think we go right to heaven when we pass away, that would defy the need for christ coming back for us.. i think we “Wait” in another place til we are all called home. I think to tho that Heaven would have clouds since they are a beautiful creation of God, i think we all have looked at clouds in awe at some point in our lives..\n\n","date":"December 7, 2011 at 1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
