To me, the Christian worldview simply put it all together without any leaks while my metaphysical naturalistic outlook seemed to collapse on my face. So it’s not as much as relying off of one or two ‘hints’ but the big picture.\nI suppose ‘prove’ is not the right word as one cannot show it to be the absolute case. Rather, the right idea would be ‘best possible explanation’.\nAs for my faith, obviously if the Shroud was shown to be false I’d do a double take, but I would not jump ship and go back to atheism/agnosticism. I’ve experienced and seen things that make no sense in a naturalistic worldview. I can’t say for sure (and I don’t think I will ever have to), but I’d probably remain a Christian. The Shroud was the straw that broke the camels back for me; apologetic works of the likes of N.T. Wright and others had already put me on shaky ground.\nAs for using it to convert or not, there’s nothing against it in the Orthodox Church so I guess we’ll have to disagree. I know that I’ve gotten my friends to at least reconsider their worldviews and are giving the time to look into the Shroud. Plus, at the end of the day, if the Shroud really is Christ’s and can at least provide possible evidence (not proof) for the Resurrection, then why shouldn’t we use it? Are we not called to evangelize all nations? Would this not finally be the ‘scientific evidence’ Dawkins et. al have been asking for (on their faulty epistomological assumptions)?\nPerhaps, though, I’m just a case of zeal without knowledge. It’s just that the Shroud did so much for me and I want to thus share it with others. Lord, have mercy.\nGod Bless,\n– Nick\n\n","date":"July 21, 2011 at 1:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/05/crazy-talk-are-atheists-biased-or-just-uninformed/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Crazy Talk: Are Atheists biased or just uninformed?"}],"history":[{"author":"nick","post":"Dan,\nThanks a ton for making mention of this as it took me many months of work (and yes, that’s a picture of me — Scribd auto linked it from my facebook).\nRuss,\nI understand your position, and at no point can we prove any what we’re saying. The Shroud bares a lot of importance to me because it was putting it in the context of apologetic writings (albeit in a far more underdeveloped form than in the lecture) that made me leave my atheism/agnosticism and to, after roughly half a year, be baptized and chrismated into the Eastern Orthodox Church. Hence I felt I had a duty to at least compile my thought together and put it out there for people to examine. But again, I understand the reservation of others — we need to proceed to research it non-dogmatically if we’re going to learn more about it.\n\n","date":"February 26, 2012 at 3:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/26/a-rather-silly-blog-with-a-not-sol-silly-shroud-of-turin-lecture/","cat":"history","title":"A Rather Silly Blog with a not so silly Shroud of Turin Lecture"},{"author":"nick","post":"Robert,\nYou’re assuming the conclusion before the evidence is even in, pure and simple.

Many thanks to Mr. Porter.\nYannick,\nYou’re absolutely right that the Shroud could never be proven to be the Shroud of Christ; as we probably all know Science doesn’t actually ‘prove’ anything but is an epistomology of measurement and recording. It disproves other explanations, but it never proves a certain one. My only issue is when I see this:\n“If we could prove our faith, then faith would not be faith no more !”\nI don’t get this. Belief that Christ rose doesn’t necessarily mean I have faith in Christ. Paul said that all are without excuse in believing that there is a God, but he talks about faith — the trust and love in God — separately. I largely agree with your post and will admit that perhaps I wanted too much out of it. I still don’t think it’s wrong to present it to others though at the very least as a possible justification for belief. I.e., Dawkins can’t go telling me irrational if I show him the Shroud as what led me to belief. \nIf still, I know that I could never use it as proof — it would simply be a piece of a much larger puzzle. One last thing. You said:\n“And, what’s the best about the Shroud, it forces some to reconsider what they really believe. That’s a very good thing.”\nI completely agree.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2011 at 6:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/21/more-on-crazy-talk-are-atheists-biased-or-just-uninformed/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on Crazy Talk: Are Atheists biased or just uninformed?"},{"author":"nick","post":"Yannick,\nOne last thing.
