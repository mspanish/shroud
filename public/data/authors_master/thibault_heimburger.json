None of them have shown that a contact-ONLY mechanism could explain all of the TS image.”Your answer: “That’s because the modelling assumed a corpse (or human volunteer in lab experiments) and a loosely draped cloth. In other words the model assumed authenticity, and is simply trying to account for apparent discrepancies. Thus we have the absurdity of the ‘collapsing cloth’ theory that even Rogers felt obliged to dismiss as unscientific.”I thought I was clear enough. The researchers in question were mainly anti-authenticity researchers who tried to reproduce the TS image using a contact-only technique (Nickel, Garlaschelli, Pesce for the scorch hypothesis and others).You wrote: ”  One can consider the problem of imprinting into the valleys and hollows of a 3D template that would normally be inaccessible to a loosely draped cloth that missed them through bridging extremities. That’s where some methodology I described previously comes into its own, i.e. with manual moulding of linen to 3D relief, increasing the area that is imprinted”At least we agree that the “scorch hypothesis” is a contact-only model: no contact=no color.Your experiments as well as my own experiments clearly show that neither convection nor radiation can produce a color in this model.I agree that manual moulding of linen to 3D relief can increase the imprinted area.This is obvious.However, looking carefully at your crucifix experiments, many areas of your heated crucifix are not at all imprinted (for example the thighs): there is no color at all in those areas.Your 3D rendering is misleading: these uncolored areas seem to have 3D properties (ImageJ) but these pseudo-3D properties (in those uncolored areas) come from the shadows coming from the “valleys” in the fabric which are only the result of the pressure applied to the fabric.In practice, it seems very difficult (according to my and your experiments) to obtain a color from the “valleys” of the template.

Let me explain.If the upper rectangle is a lid (Proposition A= true) then the lower rectangle is necessarily the sarcophagus (Proposition B = true).A (true) implies B (true). Do you agree ?The skeptics thinks that the upper rectangle cannot be anything else than a lid.It is true that the rectangular shape of this object strongly suggests that it is a lid.But it is also true that , in the context of medieval paintings and illuminations of this particular event, the lids (when present) are not similar to the ‘lid’ of the Pray Codex.They are always depicted as an homogeneous rectangle and very often, their three-dimensional properties are obvious.To the contrary the upper rectangle of the Pray Codex is bi-dimensional (flat) and heterogeneous (two parts with something which can be interpreted as a stylized herringbone weave, the other part with crosses).   Therefore we can not know with certainty what is the upper rectangle.In this case, I suggest to test the hypothesis: If B is not true then A is not true.Logically, this proposition is strictly equivalent to the previous one: If A is true then B is true. In other words, if the lower rectangle is not a sarcophagus, then, the upper rectangle is not the lid of this sarcophagus.Therefore the question is now: does the lower rectangle of the Pray Codex represent a sarcophagus or not ?  I have uploaded the 70 first pictures cited in David Mo:https://sombraenelsudario.wordpress.com/2014/08/10/las-santas-mujeres-en-la-tumba-vacia-imagenes/Thanks to you David for this work.If you look at ALL these pictures, you will discover that in almost all the pictures the sarcophagus is clearly depicted as a sarcophagus. I mean a 3D object that is immediately understood as the sarcophagus of Christ (in this context).At this time (XI-XV century), the painters were truly able to represent the 3D properties of an object via some kind of perspective (even a naive perspective).I only could find 4 pictures in which the sarcophagus is depicted as a flat 2D rectangle.But in these cases, the painter used some ‘trick’ so that the observer immediately understands that this object is in fact a 3D object.The fact is that there is nothing in the lower triangle of the Pray Codex suggesting a 3D object, i.e a sarcophagus. This is the key point.As shown by the other paintings in the Pray Codex, the author of the Pray Codex was certainly not an amateur.In other words, if the author of the Pray Codex wanted to depict the sarcophagus in the lower rectangle, he would have used beyond any doubt some kind of 3D representation.Therefore, the lower rectangle can not be a representation of a sarcophagus.Therefore the upper rectangle can not be the lid of this sarcophagus. So what is it ?Skeptic asked: ‘ But anyhow: do you think the two rectangles represent the two halves of the shroud?’My answer: yes.More later….","date":"March 8, 2015 at 3:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Dear Hugh,” But chiefly I agree with Gian Marco that this is in many ways a typical Three Marys scene, which demands certain traditional elements, including (by this time) a sarcophagus and a lid, more or less rectangular, and a shroud, more or less crumpled into a heap. These elements are present. If the artist wanted to show the shroud more clearly, he would have added it to the composition, not substituted it for one of these elements, and if he had wanted to create a new icon altogether, he would not have made it so similar to the previous icon that it could easily be mistaken for it.”You have understood perfectly my reasoning.I agree that the Pray codex is a three Marys scene, that typically contains one element: the sarcophagus and very often the shroud and often the lid.But here the problem is that the lower rectangle, which is assumed to be the ‘sarcophagus’ does not look at all like a sarcophagus for the reasons I explained.If the only feature (the sarcophagus) that is ALWAYS found in the Marys scene is absent (i.e as a 3D object), There are 3 possibilities:1) the painter was truly hopeless. I don’t think so. All of the paintings (even the most naive) shows that at the time everybody could represent more or less a 3D object. The high (the third dimension) of an object is always shown and obvious. For example, on the Pray Codex (upper scene), we can see that the author was able to represent the 3D (the high)  of the table.2) The painter was sure that, despite the lack of 3D characteristics, his lower rectangle would be interpreted as the sarcophagus. I cannot eliminate this hypothesis.3) Although the whole scene is a ” three Mary scene”, the upper and lower rectangles does not represent the sarcophagus and the lid but Christ’s shroud. After all, the shroud was in the empty tomb. Let’s try to interpret the Pray Codex this way: the Angel shows Christ’s shroud, not the sarcophagus.More later…","date":"March 9, 2015 at 4:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I agree with David.135 comments (!).

In most reproductions we understand that they tried to “reconcile” the “strange” figure they saw with the usual characteristics of a human shape, an albedo (see for example the rounded open eyes).In the context of the Shroud, Negativity is linked to some kind of body/fabric distance.On the basis of the reproductions, it is even not obvious that a medieval painter could think in such a way.Some of the reproductions do show an attempt to reproduce the faintness of the image.This fact implies that about 150 years after Lirey, the Shroud image was more or less as faint as today.Fig.23 and 24 show pigment flakes, not found on the Shroud.For some of you, the pigments disappeared with time and/or (alleged) washing etc…living only the medium (Gesso, Gum Arabic ….).Even in this case, I think it is impossible for many reasons.","date":"January 19, 2015 at 3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"“Is it not easier to explain added details in a copy of a faint original than to explain why the artist chose to paint a faint copy of the much more vivid original?”I do not see any added detail in this beautiful copy.To the contrary I do see some missing details (for example the epsilon blood mark).The attempt to create a faint image with fuzzy contours is obvious. It is the best example of such an attempt but not the only one.Why a painter of the 16th century would reproduce a faint image, if the original was not faint at the time? This is a non sense.We can be sure that in 1527 the image was about the same as the Turin Shroud we see today: a faint image with fuzzy contours an without any added “details” like a crown or a loincloth.The observation of this beautiful and successful reproduction of the TS before the Chambery fire is very interesting.

The concept that the crucified man was not washed prior to being placed on the Shroud would not be readily acceptable by the forensic pathologist whose expertise also includes studies of antemortem and postmortem bloodflow patterns on fabrics in forensic reconstructions. Acceptance of the hypothesis that the victim was not washed would therefore place the authenticity of the TS in serious doubts”.“It is also of importance to note that scourge markings were made many hours prior to removal from the cross, so that incrusted clots would have formed in the wounds, therefore making it difficult to understand how the scourge marks could have left such precise imprints. Every forensic pathologist I have consulted has agreed that the wounds would have caused a large ammount of bleeding and that the body had to be washed, to account for the preciseness of the wounds on the Shroud. On the december 1980 issue of Medical World News, dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist and a former Chief Medical Examiner of New-York City, agreed that if the Shroud is genuine, the body must have been washed. He also added that if the body was washed, there might be some oozing from the wounds”.“Therefore, if the body was not washed, there would have been an absence of most of the body image in patchy distribution all over the Shroud because there would have been large amounts of blood all over the Shroud, preventing the image-production mechanism”.“During my observations of rabbinic washings in trauma cases, especially in circumstances with sundown rapidly approaching, the rabbis would quickly wash the body, sometimes washing the front of the body and sitting up the body to do the back, initiating blood flows in wounds that were present on the face and the torso.

There is only a flat graph between 350 and about 520 nm.But you forget 2 important facts:1) Heller and Adler published in “Blood on the Shroud of Turin” the transmission spectrum of a brownish red stained fibril from one of the blood areas of the Shroud (in the Orphaned manuscript, p. 31). The peak at about 410 nm. is obvious. This peak is simply the famous Soret band (400-450 nm.) indicative of regular porphyrinic material. In addition a very small peak at about 520 nm. is also visible in their spectra.2) Pellicori ( in “Spectral properties of the Shroud of Turin”, Applied optics, Vol;19, N)12, 15 June 1980, Fig.4, p. 1916) have shown the results of several experiments. On a 4 days-old bloodstain on linen the Soret band is clearly visible. But after artificially aging (60°C, 7.5 hours) this bands become much less obvious. Pellicori thought that the lack of the Soret band [in Gilbert’s spectra] was probably due to the poor Signal to Background ratio.I completely disagree with your sentence: ” The Gilberts’ spectrum is definitely not typical of methemoglobin, nor of blood of any description, and its very partial resemblance to a blood spectrum over a small range of wavelengths is entirely coincidental.”Coincidental? Really ? The Gilbert’s spectrum is typical of methemoglobin in the range 500-700 nm including the band at about 630-650 nm. (Don’t you see it ?)The fact that the 400-450 nm. strong Soret band is not seen in Gilbert’s spectra is not truly significant because Pellicori has shown that ageing of blood on linen strongly lowers the Soret band and because of the poor Signal to background ratio.More generally, what Kelly and myself tried to show is that if we have to think about TS blood, we have to take into account all the data from Heller and Adler, STURP data, Bollone, Pellicori etc..and not from a single source.","date":"December 17, 2013 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Yes, whole blood;","date":"December 17, 2013 at 5:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"From Schwalbe and Rogers :” Heller and Adler have noted that there is no specific spectrum for blood per se: the spectral characteristics depend on the chemical state (coordination and decomposition) of the hemoglobin and also on its state of aggregation.

Cameron and George have published absorption spectra for acid methemoglobin in the range 480-680 nm. These data strongly resemble the Gilbert’s curve and even include the small absorption structure at about 630 nm.”I have the Cameron’s paper and the resemblance is obvious.From Heller’s book (Report on the Shroud of Turin, 1983), we know that the spectra were sent to Cameron (and another expert).

In addition the bloodstains are completely dried.Do you think that taking into account these conditions, the bilirubin would have been completely destroyed ?Adler used the Erlich’s reagent using the method of Jendrassik (microspotting technique). “Using the same microspotting technique as described above, characteristic blue azobilirubin colors could be positively detected in reflected light on the surfaces of the olive colored shards, the orange globs, and also, weakly on the more orange colored red coated fibrils. The test was sensitive to acid, turning a paler purple, and was discharged by 10 minutes of short wave UV light as is characteristic of this color test. In the previous spectral work it was noted that a peak does appear both in the whole cloth reflection studies and in micro-spectrophotometry of the tape samples at about 450 nm. This is quite typical of bilidienes and similar bile pigments structures…” I understand that the Erlich (classical) test for bilirubin was positive and that the spectra were consistent with the presence of bilirubine. For me, taking into account all the parameters (the bood on the TS is real blood, olive color of some of the “objects” mainly found in the serum areas, the results of the Erlich tests on these objects, macro and microspectrometry data) are self consistent.If you think that there is no bilirubin, you must interpret the Erlich test results as a false positive.

Were they justified in doing so? I don’t know.”“Why is this”?Because at the time (1978 and later), the Centro (Baima Bollone and co-workers) considered the TS as its own property.Moreover, Baima Bollone never published his findings in peer-reviewed journals but only in the journal of the Centro.The whole context explains the attitude of STURP.It was not a scientific problem but a “political” problem.Knowing that, what do we have to do now?In my opinion, to look at both STURP’s  and Bollone’s findings.The final result is clear: the “blood” on the Shroud is truly human/primate blood.Do you agree?","date":"May 30, 2015 at 2:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/27/colin-berry-is-not-seeing-red/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Colin Berry is not Seeing Red"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Yes, the blood on the Shroud is “too red”.Yes the color of the blood strongly depends on lighting etc.But, as a general rule, it is too red.Nevertheless, it is human blood.The identification of blood rests on Heller and Adler’s tests (not only porphyrin, Hugh, but also many other tests for the other components of blood, including immunology) AND P.B.

In fact, the problem of the bloodstain pattern is much more complex… And my experiments were very preliminary experiments.Here is what Dr. Frederic Zugibe wrote (SSG, October 3, 2005):”Dear Dr. Thibault,and othersTHINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE!I would like to comment concerning your blood flow theories. I don’t wish to bean iconoclast but you are delving into a very specialized area of forensicreconstruction that takes years of specialized training and experience. As youperhaps know I have been studying blood patterns on deceased individuals on adaily basis for over 34 years, I have testified in court on numerous occasionsregarding blood patterns and have published papers in the area of patternedinjuries. I enjoyed reading the experiment you performed on yourself in a senseof self sacrifice. First of all, there is a complete difference in blood patternreconstruction in the living versus the deceased in most instances. In additiona knowledge of Human Anatomy and Physiology is of paramount importance inunderstanding how the one way valves function within the blood vessels in thecirculation through the arms and legs.Also, as I previously related, in violent type deaths, fibrinolysins and alteredclotting factors are produced causing a fluidity of blood. Moreover there is anabsence of the normal contractions of blood vessels that play a prominent rolein bleeding control.After death, when the arms are held above the head in the position ofcrucifixion, the blood in the arms would not flow backwards because the flow isgoverned by one way valves unless they are defective as in varicose veins. Ifthe arms of the decedent are above the head in crucifixion, at the time ofdeath, the ventricles of the heart ejects the blood into the circulation causingthe veins to be filled (creating pressure in the veins of the arms on the oneway valves). In this scenario, when the nail is initially pulled out of thehands during removal from the cross, blood would flow out of the hand wound downthe arm. The nature of the flow is governed by many variables of position indetaching the victim from the cross and in the act of lowering him where anumber of positions are assumed. It is also of paramount importance to know thatthe amount of blood on a victim appears many times greater than it actually is.I have investigated numerous murder scenes with blood all over the victim, onthe walls and floors and when forensic calculations are made, the amount ofblood extruded is found to be many times less than it appeared to be. It isdifficult for the uninitiated to understand these simple forensic concepts thatonly come with training and experience.

This is only an analogy.Is the TS image color distribution like a “stochastic “process ?In my opinion, not exactly.Why ?It is true that the color distribution in a given image area depends only on the number of colored fibers having the same density (+/- 10%) and not on the density of the fibers (the half-tone effect).But the colored fibers are not randomly colored.In a colored thread, there are BUNDLES of colored fires adjacent to bundles of uncolored fibers     If there is a stochastic process, it is at thread level and not only at fiber level.In other words, a stochastic process at fiber level does not explain the fact that the colored fibers are bulked together in bundles adjacent to uncolored bundles of fibers in a given image thread.","date":"June 14, 2014 at 4:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/14/paper-chase-a-natural-stochastic-process-may-explain-the-coexistence-of-bloodstains-and-an-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Paper Chase:  A Natural Stochastic Process May Explain the Coexistence of Bloodstains and an Image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Does anybody see what CB “sees” ?

It is not possible that the trickles down the arms were post mortem issues, and they were clearly not washed.”No.The arm blood flows were not washed, because, according to Zugibe they were post-mortem blood flows.Why ?1) When the TS man was crucified, the hand/wrist was compressed against the crosspiece of the cross by nailing, “thereby preventing any discernable blood flows. In addition (..), the blood pressure was very low and the arms were in elevated position” (FZ, the crucifixion of Jesus, p. 222).Remember that, after scourging, the blood pressure was likely very low and the blood itself very “viscous”.2) “It is obvious that the blood flows on the arms occurred right after removal of the nails (which had sealed the wounds during suspension from the hand areas, causing the blood that contained  fibrinolysins to flow down the back of the arms from the nail exit wound while the arms were suspended above the head still in rigor at the same angle in which they had been nailed to the crosspiece (…) Forensically speaking, the reason for the small amount of blood on the arms is due to the fact that the heart was not beating when the nails were removed and the arms were in a suspended position. Moreover, the arms would have been free of blood prior to death because the large nails would have sealed the wounds, the blood pressure was very low, and the arms were in elevated position” (FZ). “Zugibe is anxious to show that the bloodflows from the wrist and spear wounds were post mortem, but his illustration, of a tiny drip of blood taking four hours to emerge from a cadaveric wrist, is hardly justification of that”.Yes.FZ is very confusing here. The illustration shows that AFTER WASHING, some blood from a wound of a deceased victim appears at the surface of the skin.In my opinion this observed fact has nothing to do with the blood flows on the arms but rather with the problem of the scourge marks.","date":"October 14, 2015 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/11/was-jesus-body-washed/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Was Jesus’ Body Washed?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Dear Colin,About bilirubin.You wrote: “Bilirubin is converted by light and oxygen to decomposition products.

False. She did not look carefully at the C14 corner because she was not there in 1988. And her paper is full of mistakes re Rogers’ findings. She obviously did not understand anything about Rogers’ claims. She did not look (to my knowledge) at the threads of the border of the C14 sampling area in 2002 with a microscope. She did not took any piece of threads and she did look at them through a microscope.  CF: “The areas for the radiocarbon dating that were examined microscopically found some fibers of cotton which were removed”.False. Oxford found a “rogue fiber” at the surface of his sample. Probably the labs did look quickly at the surface of the samples with a microscope. No more. I repeat: it is ABSOLUTELY impossible to know anything about the number and the location of cotton fibers in a thread without separating the fibers of the threads. This was NOT done by the labs. CF: ” An impression, backed by no evidence at all, is left that the reweave was largely cotton but we know from the microscopic examination of the C14 samples that is not the case.”Microscopic examination? By whom ? By the labs? No. Did they remove some threads of their samples? No. Did they divide the threads into fibers ?. No. Did they perform any kind of chemical investigation?  No.  CF (171): ” I still want to clarify the problem of the cotton. There simply is not enough cotton used to sway the carbon-14 date so if there was a reweave that swayed the date it could not have been as a result of a cotton reweave. But why would they have mixed cotton and linen in the reweave?”Probably because cotton is much more able to retain the dye found by Rogers than linen.And: CF (177): “If you want to sustain the ‘cotton reweave’ claim, please provide us with a PERCENTAGE, with supporting evidence, of how much cotton was in the samples actually tested in the labs- you can base it on material from the surrounding area if you want.”Please, (re)readhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part1.pdf(and parts 2 and 3)It is a complete misunderstanding of the problem.The anomalous C14 corner is made of many “modern” (16 th century ?) blended cotton/linen THREADS mixed with few ancient linen threads (from the Shroud main part).In the “modern” blended threads both linen and cotton fibers are “modern”.We know that because of the lignin/vanillin Wiesner tests.

It has to do with the surface chemistry as shown by the UV-Vis fluorescence photograph.The problem comes from the term ‘contamination’.What Morgan demonstrated is:1) that the mean surface chemistry of the C14 sample/region is truly (statistically) different from the surface chemistry of a typical TS neighboring area.2) that the mean surface chemistry of each of the Arizona #1, Zurich and Oxford samples is truly (statistically) different from the surface chemistry of a typical TS neighboring area.3) that there is an almost perfect correlation between the calendar C14 age of a given sample (Arizona#1 etc..) and the surface chemistry as measured by the z-score in the UV-Vis image.It means ONLY that the surface contamination of Arizona1 is smaller that the surface contamination of Oxford.Surface chemistry (UV-Vis photograph analysis) is likely correlative to the Dye found by Rogers (as Morgan wrote), NOT to the composition of the fabric itself.Therefore, I completely disagree with your claim: ” “We can say with authority than any contamination of the radiocarbon corner of the shroud made it appear older, not younger, than it really is.”You are confusing surface contamination (likely Rogers’s dye, which has been eliminated by the C14 standard cleaning procedures) and “contamination” of the fabric itself by “new” pieces of threads.I hate the word “contamination”.Your answer might clarify the argument.","date":"March 23, 2015 at 4:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/22/do-the-blue-quad-mosaics-tell-a-different-story-than-we-think/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Do the Blue Quad Mosaics tell a different story than we think?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Hugh, you wrote:“As for the pieces of Arizona radiocarbon sample which were not used, the long thin one has disappeared into the estate of Prof. Donahue, I believe, and the other, photographed by Barrie, can be easily positioned…”Can you explain and clearly demonstrate why Jull’s sample is positioned where it is in your picture ?Because, I disagree.I would like to compare your demonstration with my own thoughts.Maybe, am I wrong ?Thanks.","date":"March 23, 2015 at 5:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/22/do-the-blue-quad-mosaics-tell-a-different-story-than-we-think/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Do the Blue Quad Mosaics tell a different story than we think?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Thanks Hugh,” I should be very grateful for your comments.”Yes I agree with you about the position of Jull’s sample (I used another method).More later.","date":"March 24, 2015 at 4:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/22/do-the-blue-quad-mosaics-tell-a-different-story-than-we-think/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Do the Blue Quad Mosaics tell a different story than we think?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Max,Je suis très intéressé par la technique du “retissage par épissure”.Avez-vous des références ?Y at-il un lien vers votre papier de 2007 ?I am very interested in the “French reweaving” technique using splices.Do you have some references ?Is there a link to your 2007 paper ?","date":"May 21, 2014 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/documented-pieces-removed-from-the-shroud/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Documented Pieces Removed from the Shroud"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Max,I repeat: Je suis très intéressé par la technique du “retissage par épissure”.Avez-vous des références ?Y at-il un lien vers votre papier de 2007 ?I am very interested in the “French reweaving” technique using splices.Do you have some references ?Is there a link to your 2007 paper ?","date":"May 23, 2014 at 3:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/documented-pieces-removed-from-the-shroud/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Documented Pieces Removed from the Shroud"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Colin,just a question:What do you mean exactly (ha, ha, aha…) with regard to Andy’s comment ?I simply don’t understand.Thibault.","date":"November 18, 2012 at 7:11 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/draft-document-discovered-in-the-paper-skip-at-my-local-recycling-centre-ten-killer-arguments-for-opposing-any-re-run-of-the-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"killer_arguments","title":"Draft document discovered in the paper-skip at my local recycling centre: “Ten killer arguments for opposing any re-run of the radiocarbon dating.”"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"OK.

Let me explain:The sentence: “Incidentally, the pyrolysis/ms spectra of samples from apparent blood spots showed hydroxyproline peaks at mass 131, a pyrolysis product of animal proteins”is the only allusion to hydroxyproline (and blood) in the entire Rogers’ TCA paper. Moreover, the term “incidentally” is important. You are right: peak 131 is found in all of the samples analysed.Here is what Rogers wrote re the “problem” of peak 131 and hydroxyproline (from “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin”, p.56-57):” When animal proteins are heated, a major pyrolysis product is 4-hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline’s signal at m:e 131 appeared very early in the pyrolysis of the Zina samples that showed distinct red spots on the fibers…Indeed m/e 131 was the major organic pyrolysis product detected between masses 100 and 150 at the lowest temperature that gave any detectable products (figure VIII-7)”Fig VIII-7 (Zina sample) shows an almost empty spectrum, with peak 131 intensity at about 20% and only 5 other signals less than 10%).He adds: ” Mass 131 peaks appeared AT MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURES in all of the spectra, but those are in the ranges where cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses are decomposing.The spectrum gets very complex at those higher temperatures.None of the images fibers, control fibers, or Raes fibers showed mass 131 at low temperatures. Although mass 131 products can appear from materials other than animal proteins, if animal proteins are present mass 131 MUST appear in the pyrolysis products. The lower the temperature at which mass 131 appears, the more likely it is a result of the pyrolysis of an animal protein”.The interpretation of Rogers is now absolutely clear: Rogers pointed out the different meanings of peak 131, taking into account the temperatures.– In the Zinna (blood) sample it is probably ( please note that he is speaking of high probability) a protein– In all the other samples, Rogers clearly interprets pic 131 as a decomposition product of the material itself (…”but those are in the ranges where cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses are decomposing..”)What is your mistake? In the sentence in your Fig.1, which is the spectrum of a Shroud-image fiber, “that was taken when the first decomposition products started to appear over a sample of image fiber” wrote Rogers (“A chemist perspective…”, p.54).Your sentence: Peak at mass=131 (SUPPOSEDLY HYDROXYPROLINE). This is the most abundant ion in the mass spectra and according to Rogers, correlated with animal protein (blood spots?)”.No in this spectrum and the others, Rogers did NOT say that peak 131 is correlated with hydroxyproline.In fact, he wrote exactly the contrary !I hope I am clear enough. I can’t do more.","date":"September 6, 2015 at 8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Dear Marco,Can you give us the link for your final “free of charge” version ?Thanks.","date":"September 10, 2015 at 2:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Clicking on the link of the post ?http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040603115003093Then, we are asked to purchase your final paper. 39,95  $ !!I have purchased your previous version.It’s enough.Fortunately, somebody sent me your final version which is exactly the same as the previous one, despite I wrote here.Any way, I will write an answer to TCA..The core of your demonstration is that the Mass spectrum of the “low pyrolysis of fibers from Raes sample” (in Rogers’ paper) is similar to the spectrum of : ” a molecule with a long aliphatic chain(exadecan-1-ol, [your example]), which fragmentation pattern is similar to the contaminant present in the Raes sample (sample b).with analogous isotopic pattern..”That’s true.But there are also many other molecules without a long aliphatic chain which show  the same fragmentation pattern.","date":"September 10, 2015 at 3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Hi Hugh,As I wrote, this is a problem that is found in almost all of Rogers’ papers: he includes here and there some thoughts and sentences that are not fully relevant in the context.Here, this short sentence about blood and hydroxyproline which has nothing to do with his main demonstration.Yes it would have been better for Rogers not to write this sentence in his TCA paper.Nevertheless, as I wrote earlier, even if one has no knowledge of the clear explanations found in Rogers book, something very simple must come immediately to the mind of the reader of Rogers’ TCA paper: if peak 131 is only associated to hydroxyproline/protein/blood how is it that it is found in the two spectra (image fiber and Raes sample, both without blood) shown in his paper?This alone, should be enough for the reader to understand that there is something wrong in this reasoning.And then, if this reader does really want to truly understand Rogers, he has to do what I did: to try to find a clear explanation in all of Rogers’ papers, including his book.Apparently, this work has not been done made by the authors.I repeat: Rogers never thought and never wrote that peak 131 in the MS spectra are related to hydroxyprolin, except in the Zina sample spectrum only at the lowest temperature.“Possibly true?” “Not very convincing?”Really?With all the proofs I gave, how can you write that ?

All the results are statistically consistent.The final result of all the tests gives a result in the first century for the TS (I can’t provide the details).From a strict scientific point of view, these findings have to be discussed among experts and I don’t know if the results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal (I hope so). But in any case, these results have to be considered as they are. They have absolutely no link with radiations or CD’s hypotheses.– I can say you with certainty that Fanti’s TS sample is genuine, even if it is not an official sample.

It has to do with the surface chemistry as shown by the UV-Vis fluorescence photograph.The problem comes from the term ‘contamination’.What Morgan demonstrated is:1) that the mean surface chemistry of the C14 sample/region is truly (statistically) different from the surface chemistry of a typical TS neighboring area.2) that the mean surface chemistry of each of the Arizona #1, Zurich and Oxford samples is truly (statistically)  different from the surface chemistry of a typical TS neighboring area.3) that there is an almost perfect correlation between the calendar C14 age of a given sample (Arizona#1 etc..) and the surface chemistry as measured by the z-score in the UV-Vis image.It means ONLY that the surface contamination of Arizona1 is smaller that the surface contamination of Oxford.Surface chemistry (UV-Vis photograph analysis) is likely correlative to the Dye found by Rogers (as Morgan wrote), NOT to the composition of the fabric itself.Therefore, I completely disagree with your claim: ”  “We can say with authority than any contamination of the radiocarbon corner of the shroud made it appear older, not younger, than it really is.”You are confusing surface contamination (likely Rogers’s dye, which has been eliminated by the C14 standard cleaning procedures) and “contamination” of the fabric itself by “new” pieces of threads.I hate the word “contamination”.","date":"March 22, 2015 at 10:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/20/john-klotz-delivers-the-knockout/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"John Klotz Delivers the Knockout"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Ramsey: ” It’s also been hypothesized that the patch we tested was a modern repair, but most of us agree that’s implausible, because the weave is very unusual and matches the rest of the shroud perfectly”Is it truly an argument against the “repair hypothesis”?It is not more difficult to perform French reweaving on a 3/1 herringbone weave than on a plain weave for example.With due respect to Prof.Ramsey, this sentence has nothing to do with the problem.Paul Malloney’s paper is truly a must read.","date":"December 21, 2014 at 2:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/19/just-published-what-went-wrong-with-the-radiocarbon-date/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Just Published:  What Went Wrong with the Radiocarbon Date?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"1. It should perhaps (I repeat perhaps) be possible if the experts did not have in mind this possibility and look at it specifically. They probably looked at this corner to verify the weave, the lack of obvious anomalies and extraneous threads etc.. They also saw the Shroud for the first time.In other words, to my knowledge, with due respect to them, they were not prepared to eliminate this possibility, simply because at the time they could not imagine such a hypothesis.Christophe Moulhertat (probably the best expert in ancient cloths in France) wrote :” Si on a des fils trafiqués avec une volonté de cacher la chose, il faut déjà y penser, et être équipé pour pouvoir voir ça. Sinon, si le réparation est bien faite, on peut passer à côté. Il faut vraiment une analyse fine”.The important words are “il faut déjà y penser” (you must first have to think about that [invisible mending]).However, I agree that it is difficult to accept such a mistake from true experts.But the fact is that the properties of some of the Raes/C14 corner threads are not similar to that of the main cloth (cotton, dye and vanillin).There is also the possibility that the Raes/C14 corner consists of a mixture of portions of ancient threads spliced together with portions of modern threads.In this case, it would be truly invisible.Moulherat was shocked by the fact that the radiocarbon sample came from a single small area of the Shroud.This was the big mistake.As I wrote in my presentation in Saint-Louis, there is a conflict between the findings of the textile experts and Rogers’ findings.Both of them are reliable.Conclusion: The Shroud must be re-dated.2.

In addition many short pieces of broken cotton fibers are found everywhere. Now, if you apply a sticky tape on this Raes thread, what do you expect to see under the microscope? Many cotton fibers. I am right?In other words, if the main Shroud had the same linen/cotton content than the Raes/C14 corner, all or most of the STURP sticky samples (which were much larger than a single thread) would show a large number of cotton fibers. But Rogers did not find any “old” cotton fibers in the STURP samples (except some modern fibers probably coming from the cotton gloves used in 1978).This explains why Rogers wrote that the shroud is almost pure linen.Paul Maloney did look at the Frei samples (surface samples), as well at some STURP surface samples.Here is what he wrote in a message to SSG:“As many of you know I spent more than 500 hours at the microscope studyingMax Frei’s sticky tapes. I conducted my studies first using an E. Leitz andthen on a Nikon Optiphot. So, let me say first that on all of those tapesthere is, in fact, cotton. BUT this statement, as put, is hardlyscientific because I have not identified for you the sources for the cottonon the Shroud or on the tapes versus cotton IN the Shroud. Please note thatI am making a distinction between cotton ON the tapes, cotton IN the Shroud,and cotton ON the Shroud.First, cotton ON the [Frei] tapes. I found ample amounts of cotton, white, cleancotton located SOLELY on the leads of the tapes. But there is a readyanswer for this source. Max Frei borrowed the gloves from STURP–I believeit was Bob Dinegar, at Frei’s request, who got the cotton gloves for him.Those cotton gloves came from the United States and are not made ofGossypium herbaceum. This cotton came from the tips of the cotton gloves asMax Frei took his samples. So we can rule out any new cotton fibers on theleads of the tapes as being relevant to our discussion.Second, cotton ON the surface of the Shroud. I found trace amounts ofcotton, randomly positioned, on the BODIES of the tapes. Nearly all of thiscotton was colored in some way (i.e. dyed). Thus, it must be interpreted asoriginating from the clothing of those who were in contact with the Shroudduring its history–including its recent history (1978 or prior).Third, cotton IN the weave or IN the spun threads of the Shroud. I havecategorically NEVER attested cotton anywhere on any of the Frei tapes,either bodies of the tapes, or leads of the tapes, that was co-spun withlinen fibers which, to me at least, would constitute some evidence for aco-mixture of cotton and linen on the main part of the Shroud and existingthere as part of the original weaving of the cloth. Furthermore, I acceptRay Rogers’ own research that the cotton co-mixed in the yarn is ofrelatively modern origin and limited to the area that Joe Marino and M. SueBenford had originally identified as a repaired area: the so-called “RaesCorner” of the Shroud.Finally, independently, I had the privilege of examining three of STURP’stapes which came from the main body of the Shroud cloth. Those tapes are 6AF, 3 BF, and 3 EF. Nowhere on those three tapes did I find ANY cotton!All of the fibers are linen!So far as I can tell, there should be no argument as to whether the Shroudwas entirely the co-mixture of cotton and linen because there is simply nofactual evidence to support it”.Regarding cotton, there is a big difference between the Raes/C14 corner and the main Shroud.","date":"December 23, 2014 at 3:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/19/just-published-what-went-wrong-with-the-radiocarbon-date/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Just Published:  What Went Wrong with the Radiocarbon Date?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Thanks Hugh, I understand tour position (more investigation is needed).Merry Christmas to you and to all.Thibault.","date":"December 24, 2014 at 2:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/19/just-published-what-went-wrong-with-the-radiocarbon-date/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Just Published:  What Went Wrong with the Radiocarbon Date?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"“Perhaps Thibault can tell us more about “In 1988, the textile experts looked at this area with binocular microscopes.” When did they do that?

I don’t know exactly where and when. Obviously,they looked at the sampling area with a microscope before giving their agreement. ” As for invisible mending, I agree that to my knowledge nobody has ever carried out the procedure I described, namely the unravelling of individual threads, merging them by bringing the unravelled threads together, and then twisting them back up together again to produce a true spliced extended thread. I also think that this would need an unravelling of at least 1-2cm of each thread, which is why it would be impossible to produce such a splice wholly within the radiocarbon sample area. However, I believe that if anybody actually did that, then it could be invisible even under a microscope”I agree that such a method should be truly invisible under a microscope.I don’t understand why ” it would be impossible to produce such a splice wholly within the radiocarbon sample area”.. “In fact, of course, all the “invisible mending” techniques currently used actually rely simply on lying new threads alongside old ones, which is clearly visible under a microscope.I agree.“or by simply twisting two threads together (illustrated in one of Sue Benford’s paper without unravelling them, which is also visible under a microscope.”I disagree. Such a method would not be visible under the microscope. “As far as I know – and Thibault will probably be able to verify or amend this – only one single piece of thread, and that a weft thread of about 10mm long, has been observed to be made of two separate pieces.

Is it possible to distinguish a fiber of Egyptian origin from a fiber originating elsewhere in the Old World? “And quite old”. How much old? ”I agree with Gian Marco Rinaldi.The British company Precision Processes (Textiles) Ltd found that these fibers were cotton fibers from the ‘old world’. This means that these cotton fibers were not modern cotton (G. hirsutum), but Gossypium  herbaceum or Gossypium arboreum.There is no mean for establishing that a cotton fiber is Egyptian.Cotton from the ‘old world’ simply means that it is not modern cotton, the kind of cotton likely found in the gloves of STURP.

I find the very obvious discrepancy between the actual size of the sample taken (16 x 81 mm) and the sample size quoted in the Nature paper (10 x 70 mm) somewhat embarrassing. I myself kept no record of the size of sample removed from the Shroud. Therefore, when I came to write the first draft of the Nature paper, I used the sample size that we had plan to remove rather than the size actually removed….”In the Gonella’s collection, I have also found a drawing from Gonella with the actual sizes and weights of the samples as well as a letter from Testore to Siliano. Shortly,– The entire first sample cut by Riggi was 8.4 cm in length and 2.2 cm in width on one side, 1.35 cm in width on the other side. The difference came from the previous Raes cut.The weight of this sample was 479 mg (Riggi) or 478.1 mg (Testore).It is impossible to calculate the actual density because this sample was not a perfect rectangle.Obviously, its density was much higher than that of the Shroud but it’s not a surprise given that this sample contained a part of the hem.– Then, Riggi eliminated the borders (including the hem) and obtained a strip: 7.9x 1.7 (still 1.35 cm in width on the “Raes side”). Weight=300 mg. Again it was not a perfect rectangle. This is not different from the dimensions of the “actual size” quoted in the Tite’s letter above (8.1×1.6). Of course, these data included the Reserve. If we do not take into account the very small missing part of this sample (Raes), the density can be calculated: Weight=300 mg, surface= 13.43 cm2, density= weight/surface= 22.33 mg/cm2.Adding 5-10% for the small Raes missing part, we have a density of about 24-25 mg/cm2, which is consistent with the known density of the shroud.Therefore there is no difference between the density of the main shroud and that of the radiocarbon samples( Reserve + dated samples)The error of Mrs. Siliato comes from the fact that she considered that the dimension of the radiodated sample was 7.00 x 1.00 cm (Weight= 300 mg, density: 42.85 mg/cm2), while it actually was 8.1x 1.6 cm (density: 23.15mg/cm2) or 7.9×1.7 (density: 22.33 mg/cm2).","date":"November 24, 2014 at 3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/23/paper-chase-the-shroud-of-turin-and-its-radiodating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase:  The Shroud of Turin and its Radiodating"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"This is an old peer-reviewed paper but, in my opinion, it is one of the most important written in the last few years.I am very surprised to see only one comment (in 2010).I would like to know your opinion (Hugh, Kelly and all of you).To begin, there is something unclear about Fig.8:“The continuous, fully-observable sewingthread represents a significant changeof technique, and suggests this sectionof thread, which incorporated the Raessample and C-14 sample areas, wasapplied from the top versus reverseof the cloth.

The fact that the 3-D scan/mass/intensity maps begins at m=50 in Rogers’ book does not mean, contrary to what I wrote, that no data were acquired bellow 50.The other possibility is described by Marco: “Since there is absolutely no other peak below M=49, it is most likely that the instrument was set to not acquire this part of the spectra. This is very common, because the peaks at low masses have little diagnostic value and their intensity might interfere with the other peaks, so it is better to cut them. If you see the spectra above, (fig 4), this is recorded without the zone below M=49. To be absolutely sure, one must see all instrumental setting (Which Rogers did not report).”This argument is specious.The abscissa in Fig.4 (Shroud sample 1-EB) begins at m=50 and ends at m=220 (in fact data were acquired up to 500 or even 750).The abscissa in Raes spectrum begins clearly at m=40.If the instrument was set not to acquire the part of the spectrum between 40 and 50, why would Rogers show the part between 40 and 50 (without any signal, except at m=49) ?This abscissa should begin at 50, as in Fig.4.Moreover, if there were strong peaks around m=43 (like in the spectra of any molecule with a long aliphatic chain), they would certainly have been showed by Rogers. He would not have “cut them”.The FACT is that in the Raes spectrum there is really absolutely no signal between m=40 and m=48, something which is a huge problem for the hypothesis of the “long aliphatic chain contaminant” hypothesis.We have the spectrum of the Raes sample.We must examine it as such, without any kind of “ad-hoc” speculation.","date":"September 19, 2015 at 1:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/14/the-chemist-rogers-and-plastic-bags/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Chemist Rogers and Plastic Bags"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Yes.It implies that the paper in question is biased.Much more tomorrow.","date":"September 19, 2015 at 2:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/14/the-chemist-rogers-and-plastic-bags/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Chemist Rogers and Plastic Bags"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I agree with Hugh, an excellent paper, OK. bravo !!The quad mosaic question is complex.First, I would like to correct Mrs Flury-Lemberg: ”  The late Raymond Rogers examined the surrounding areas where the sample had been taken, by means of infrared pictures of the shroud.

Other samples of old linens show the same type of results and therefore the presence of these elements can be ascribed to chemistry arising during the manufacture of linen from flax, e.g;, the retting process carried out in naturally hard waters”.This shows (if necessary..) that Adler performed his experiments very conscientiously and with control samples.His results show that there is no evidence of added calcium on the shroud, therefore no evidence of gesso.Of course, this fact itself does not eliminate the possibility that a thin layer of gesso (Calcium carbonate+proteins) was applied on the surface of the Shroud.The key is that gesso always contains a proteinaceous binder.Adler clearly demonstrated that there is absolutely NO protein on the Shroud (except in the blood stains).Even if all the pigments are now lost, we should find some traces of this proteinaceous binder at the surface of the shroud.There is absolutely no cementation of the fibers, there is absolutely no evidence of any kind of proteinaceous binder (using both micro-chemistry and micro-spectroscopy) on the Shroud (except the blood stains).Charles: “Carbonate used to this day to seal linen before the paint is applied to the outer fibrils ( thanks STURP).”Charles, you can not use some STURP data (Calcium) and “forget” the analysis of these data.Given all of the STURP the data, your “hypothesis” is completely ruled out.","date":"March 30, 2015 at 3:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/27/ray-schneiders-five-part-eight-hour-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"presentation","title":"Ray Schneider’s Five Part Eight Hour Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Dear Giorgio,What do you mean by “Section D” ?","date":"June 9, 2014 at 3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/08/anticipating-the-conference-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-samples/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Anticipating the Conference: Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Samples"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Hugh,Pam’s paper follows this one, which is more detailed:http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Home_files/Updated_report_on_the_Consideration_to_the_Uniformity_and_Effects_of_the_Fabric_in_the_Shroud_of_Turin-5-1.pdfI do not understand your sentence: “Pam’s excellent paper has elegantly demonstrated how little contamination there is, and therefore how unlikely it is that any reweaving has had any effect on the C14 dating.”What about the “stain”, the shrinkage (” Shrinkage is possible but the distortion within this area is so localized and acute that interference of a different kind such as mending maybeworth considering (Fig 20)”), the possible stitches, the differences in the spaces of the warp and weft interlacement (Fig.16), this strange black fiber …I agree that none of these observations necessarily imply  reweaving.But they possibly suggest reweaving and in this case why do you think that this reweaving would have had any effect on the C14 dating.Why are you speaking of “little contamination” in this context ???","date":"December 19, 2014 at 4:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/18/new-paper-by-pam-moon/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"New Paper by Pam Moon"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Well, I wonder… I was there and made my presentation.I don’t remember if Russ was sleeping :-)But, it’s not really important.You’ll have the entire paper in the next update of shroud.com..soon.","date":"November 29, 2014 at 1:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/26/st-louis-videos/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"St. Louis Videos"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I don’t think so.

But the fact is that is is very difficult for me (and probably for others) to have a general view of the scorch hypothesis (for example) on your blog where your successive ideas are scattered in so many posts.Some thoughts in haste: – heat transfer: I agree that heat transfer through radiation can be ruled out. The only kind of  heat transfer in scorch experiments, I (and you if I understand well) found is conduction. This explains all my observations. The very low diffusion of heat in linen is the key parameter and it does not depend on the other parameters. Now you have a problem and you have to introduce convection. Did you see in your own experiments any kind of indication of convection? In my opinion, convection is a perfect example of theoretical ad-hoc hypothesis without any experimental basis.– Blood/ blood exudates:   please, remember that the optical characteristics of hemoglobin are so that even a very low quantity of hemoglobin gives a red color. In other words, the fact that the blood stains  look like whole blood do not exclude the possibility that they are in fact blood exudates.

Daniel de Jonghe has remarked only that this type of fault disappeared in the chevrons of canvas used for painting of the 18th century”.My comment: This suggests that the “archaic” method disappeared in the 18th century.This also suggests that the so-called archaic method was still used in the Middle-ages as well as in ancient times. The “faults” does not tell us anything about the date of the TS.    ” As for the herringbone weave; only superficial descriptions have been advanced, irrespective of the technical complexities of the type of loom necessary.There is a fundamental difference between a 2:2 twill and one of 3:1. The herringbone and lozenge weaves are known since the Iron age, if not earlier, but the fragments discovered are generally 2:2 and all are wool. the borders of the Antinoë cushions are 2:2 and are wool.. Damask cloth, for example those of Palmyra, Treves, Conthey, Ribeauville, Cologne, Holborough, are “derivatives” of 3:1 twill (..) but they are in silk.(..) The only herringbone in LINEN so far analysed and published is that cited in note 10. It is very late-second half of the 16th century- and much simpler than that of Turin.(…) If one takes into account the 3 constitutive elements of a textile-the structure, the primary material, and the reduction of warp and weft- one must acknowledge that the Shroud of Turin is truly “incomparable”. If I understand well, 3:1 “derivative” (what does it mean?) herringbone clothes could be produced in ancient times, but all of those clothes were in silk. On the other side the only known 3:1 herringbone LINEN cloth (apparently similar to the Shroud) comes from a painting of “the last supper” made by Martin de Vos” on a 3:1 linen herringbone twill weave dating from the end of the 16th century. It is noteworthy that Vial did not know of any other similar 3:1 linen cloth from the 14th century in Europe.","date":"November 14, 2014 at 5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/13/weaving-fan-a-k-a-colin-berry/","cat":"history","title":"Weaving Fan a.k.a.

This is certainly true for the Shroud that is a fine linen cloth.Therefore one can expect to find some residual impurities at the surface of the cloth.2) According to Rogers, the fact that some colored bundles of fibers are found adjacent to bundles of uncolored fibers can be explained by the properties of the uneven “thin layer” of impurities left by the evaporation/concentration process following the washing.The “surface tension” is the key parameter.Rogers: ” My point in mentioning surface-tension effects is to show that different amounts of suspended and/or dissolved impurities would deposit during evaporation of the washing liquid, depending on the surface characteristics of the batch of fibers. The soluble and colloidal components of crude starch would be in solution/suspension, and those impurities would be deposited on all parts of the cloth as the liquid evaporated.

I think it can only be refuted by demonstrating that Rogers was mistaken about the results of this experiment.”Adler (not Rogers) did the diimide experiment.( Mario is right). Adler also found the “ghosts” and then Rogers too.Even if ” like so many other experiments involving the Shroud, it was only ever done once”, I do think that it is a fact.Rogers have shown later that the medulla of the image fibers is not colored. He also have shown that the “cellulose crystals” of the image fibers were not changed by the image forming process.There is absolutely no doubt that the color is only at the very surface of the image fibers.What does the diimide experiment mean?Colin writes (see :http://colinb-sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2014/08/lets-move-things-along-one-easy-step-at.html):“More importantly, diimide works at the molecular sub-microscopic level. Nothing can be deduced from colour or texture changes about structure at the macroscopic level (coatings etc).The very term ‘colour removal’ is itself misleading if implying that anything is physically removed. Colour ‘removal’ is a chemical change that does not physically remove anything (diimide actually adds hydrogen atoms, e.g. across C=C double bonds, that interferes with the chromophore’s light-absorbing properties).”I fully agree ( yes !!!) and I could not explain better.In other words, the diimide experiment says nothing about the chromophore carrier (PCW or impurity layer) except that it is at the very surface of the image fibers and that it very likely consists of C=C double bonds.Up to now, we have no mean to know what is the surface chromophore carrier.","date":"September 17, 2014 at 4:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/14/a-defense-of-ray-rogers-on-the-image-at-the-thread-and-fiber-level/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"A Defense of Ray Rogers on the Image at the Thread and Fiber Level"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"“Would I be correct in deducing that if hydrogen was added, that is in effect a reducing reaction, the opposite to oxidation?”That’s true.“As the experiment, like so many others involving the Shroud, seems to have only ever been done once, that still leaves a doubt, even though it is suggestive, Max’s epigram “testis unus testis nullus” remains true, and like so many other experiments it need to be repeated to create any kind of scientific conviction.”Ok.

Acetta’s hypothesis: the Shroud image as a woodcut imprint: “Woodcuts are a technique of printing designs from planks of wood incised parallel tothe vertical axis of the wood’s grain. It is one of the oldest methods of making printsfrom a relief surface, having been used in China to decorate textiles since the 5thcentury ad. In Europe, printing from wood blocks on textiles was known from the early14th century, but it had little development until paper began to be manufactured inFrance and Germany at the end of the 14th century.”http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravure_sur_boisThe oldest woodcut known in OCCIDENT is the so-called ” Bois Protat”http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bois_Protat”  Aujourd’hui, la bibliographie spécialisée est revenue sur la datation très précoce de Bouchot et s’accorde à considérer que le bois Protat date du début du xve siècle.”In other words, the first known woodcut template known in Occident ( the French ‘Bois Potrat” woodcut) was made AFTER 1400 A.D. The specialized bibliography demonstrates that there is no example of woodcut imprint in Occident before the beginning of the 15th century in Occident.Obviously the shroud (even if it is a 14th artifact) can not be a woodcut imprint.","date":"March 19, 2015 at 3:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/17/a-shift-drift-in-colin-berrys-thinking/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Shift-Drift in Colin Berry’s Thinking?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Hugh,– ““— What can those in the field of science say about how the laboratories proceeded in 1988?””I agree with your answer: ” I think there is little doubt that the laboratories performed their duties perfectly well and reported their results to their employer, which I believe was the British Museum, acting on behalf of the Shroud’s owner, in as frank a way as possible.”Nevertheless a difference of about two centuries in such a small sample is at least amazing. Such a difference can not come from different cleaning methods used by the 3 laboratories (see the results of the other samples tested).The best French expert in ancient textiles (Moulherat) was shocked by the fact that the C14 sample came only from a single area.The additional statistical analysis (Van Haelst, Riani etc..) clearly show that there is something abnormal in this dated sample. “— Can they write a paper about how dye was involved?”I myself have wondered if the chronological radiocarbon gradient might have been due to a dye applied to the Holland backing cloth to make it match the shroud, especially in the ‘missing corners’ area.

Lignins (plural) in flax is found in the middle lamella (that includes the primary cell wall), cell wall junctions, and in the S1 (external) layer of the secondary wall (a 1 microm. wide band just bellow the primary cell wall).XPS (analysis of the first 10 nm of a surface) shows that lignin in non-bleached flax is found on about 66% of the surface of the fibers. But “together the AFM and XPS results strongly suggest a surface model where lignin is present on natural cellulose fibers only as clusters and islands thicker than 10 nm”.Lignin is very sensitive to light. It is the main cause of the yellowing of paper. Near-UV produces chemical reactions (photochemistry) in some chemical groups of lignin producing yellow chromophores, particularly o-quinones.In the literature, natural aging (and yellowing) of linen textile does not study the role of lignin but the cellulose itself.“It is well known that cellulosic fibers (…) undergo degradation under the action of external agents, such as light, heat, microorganisms (…), insects and chemicals. In any case, oxygen attack is mainly responsible for cellulose degradation (..). The process is essentially due to the oxidative scission of the cellulosic macromolecule and its rate can be expressed in terms of number of glucosidic bonds broken per unit time”.In other words, even without light, heat or microorganisms, the oxygen in the air even at room temperature explains the natural (very slow) yellowing of the background of the Shroud. That’s why it is now conserved in an inert gas (argon).  The question is: ” During the processing of flax, there is an attempt to remove the lignin from the fibres, but even in modern linen, some lignin remains. Could it be (a constituent of) the ‘impurity layer’? It turns yellow quite readily in quite a short time at quite low temperatures, and with exposure to light, much more easily than cellulose, more easily than starch, and for all I know more easily than sugar as well. Has anyone else looked into this, and if so, with what conclusion?”I don’t know but this is a crucial question.Let me explain:– We know that the “impurity layer” is about 0.2 to 0.6 microm. thick (Rogers)– We know that lignin is found in flax fibers as a major component of the PCW, which is about 0.2 microm. thick.– We know that lignin covers the majority of the surface of flax fibers– Lignin (photochemistry) degradation produces many molecules with C=C and C=O groups.

There is absolutely no doubt that, in Rogers hypothesis, a color must be seen on the Shroud after some months or years (latent image).Rogers submitted his hypothesis with Arnoldi in a peer-reviewed journal Melanoidins.Ana Arnoldi is one of the best expert of the Maillard reaction in Europe.But certainly Colin is a better expert in Thermochemistry than Rogers and in Maillard reaction than both Rogers and Arnoldi !!

I have this paper (not only the abstract).This paper is on the “effect of activity of water, of pH and of temperature on the primary reaction between casein and glucose”.Not exactly the same that expected on the Shroud.However, it is a good example of the changes in color in a simple “Maillard system”.What does one read in this paper ?The changes in color were studied only at 37°C with different values of pH and Relative Humidity (RH).The color was expressed in Lovibond units. Look at Wikipedia to see what Lovibond (old) scale is. Let’s say that bellow 2 no color is truly seen. At 3 it is yellow, at 5 yellow-brown.What I read is that after 64 days at 37°C. and 70% RH a color between 2.6 (pH 6.3) and .4.4 (pH 10) can be seen.More interesting is the subsequent paper here by the same authors :“A note of the relative rates of reaction of several reducing sugars and sugar derivatives with casein” Biochimica Acta et Bipohysica Acta 4 (1950), p.532-534that is available for free (I can’t give the link. Just use “advanced search” in Google Scholars).Now, with the same methods, the authors studied the color development after 4, 8 and 16 days at 37°C (pH 6.3 and 70% RH). They used 8 different carbohydrates.The Lovibond color for glucose after 16 days of storage was 0.3 (nearly no color, like in the previous experiment). But the color of arabinose was 2.5 and that of xylose was 2.7 after 16 days only. It means, as expected, that the color depends also on the carbohydrate and glucose used in the first paper is one of the worst.There are many other parameters to study. Particularly the last step of the Maillard reaction (polymerisation and production of true melanoidins).At least, I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature.PS: I have just sent the promised document entitled “Rogers’ Maillard reaction hypothesis explained in detail by Rogers himself” to Dan.","date":"August 12, 2012 at 12:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/11/colin-berry-so-how-could-ray-rogers-have-got-it-so-wrong/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry: So how could Ray Rogers have got it so wrong?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Dear all,still waiting for Colin’s “D-day” ;-)…More seriously, it seems to me that Colin is furious with me because I did not answer to his 3-part rebuttal of my paper about the scorch hypothesis.I will not answer.

Therefore, I asked him to show his own photographs using his microscope (with his “good template”) at thread and fiber level. But for him, I had not the right to decide what he has to do ! And finally, he obliquely admitted that his own observations were similar to my observations.

But once again this fold was made after the image.Much more interesting is the discovery of another almost invisible fold, called by FL the “primary fold”. This fold can only be seen using grazing light. It is another much more delicate v-shaped grove only a few centimeters away from the other one described above which also runs along the whole length of the fabric. It belongs to the very first folding after the Shroud had been finished and is due to the production process of the fabric and is not the result of using the fabric.This is certainly the only fold that was there before the image.I have no high-resolution photographs of this particular fold but at the first look there is nothing interesting to expect.Therefore A is false.Regarding B and C, I see no problem at all with any kind of non-contact process.This kind of process may or may not leave an image between the chin and the chest.Actually there is an image whose intensity is clearly related to the color of the transverse bands that are clearly seen.Once again the “banding effect”.Is the banding effect (which is a fact) consistent with the scorch hypothesis ?

It was not a known method of image creation at that time was it? This is why I’d have thought a darker scorch would have beenpreferred by a forger — why create such a light scorch that would be difficult for people to see?Let me explain in detail my thoughts.What follows must be read in the context of a medieval forgery made either by a “simple” scorch technique or a more complex one, like the “composite painting”It has been claimed that the image was more visible in the middle-ages than now. There is no historical proof of that (to my knowledge) but it is a direct consequence of these hypotheses.Then we are told that the heavily scorched fibers found in the inevitable “hot points” (brown areas) flaked off over the time, leaving only the lightly yellowish monochromatic colored fibers we see today. Incidentally, it would be a miracle (I can explain why, but later).Consequently, those “hot spots” that can be seen with the naked eyes must have been present in the middle-ages. In other words, anybody looking carefully at the image would have recognized in some areas the typical signature of a scorch. Perhaps not the pilgrims but certainly the bishops and other “authorities” who looked at it through the centuries.To my knowledge, the possibility for the image being a scorch was never suggested until the modern ages. Think about that. Our ancestors were not stupid and they certainly knew what a scorched fabric is.Therefore, it seems much more probable that if the image is a scorch, it did not look like a scorch also in the middle-ages.” why create such a light scorch that would be difficult for people to see?”Because it’s the only way to create a “true relic”. A ghostly faint image is much more convincing than a dark scorch.And the image was as visible for the pilgrims in the middle-ages as it is now.

I’d go further, and say i do not understand Thibault’s aversion to the idea of the image being a superficial scorch, since that does not exclude authenticity. STURP describedthe chemical nature of the image layer essentially as a scorch, even if not using that precise term, i.e. as carbohydrate that had undergone chemical dehydration, oxidation etc. The various radiation hypothesis all envisage some reaction with linen carbohydrates that do not require the presence of other chemicals except those in air, so why not describe the discoloration as a radiation scorch?Maybe it’s the idea of a contact scorch that Thibault objects to, i.e. from a hot inanimate template as might be used by a medieval forger,  but who’s to say that the chemical changes are not dissimilar to that produced by any other scorched-on imprint obtained by a completely different mechanism that is more compatible with authenticity.I have no “aversion” to the idea of a superficial scorch. I just want to study it (like you Colin) but with experiments, since it is the only image-formation mechanism that is testable (more or less) easily.Sorry Colin, ”  STURP described the chemical nature of the image layer essentially as a scorch, even if not using that precise term (..)” is misleading and you know that the STURP excluded the scorch hypothesis.You should have written: “the STURP described the chemical nature of the image layer as essentially SIMILAR to a scorch..” But the chemistry of the image is also consistent with the effect of a weak acid etc..Anything that produces a superficial dehydration of the surface of the fibers can work, in theory.Yes, it is the idea of a contact scorch I object to.It seems that you agree that there are at least some problems with a contact scorch imprint.So that now you are insisting on other mechanisms involving heat transfer.Radiation (energy transferred from a hot object through electromagnetic waves, mostly infra-red) or convection (energy transferred through the kinetic energy of the heated molecules of air).The problem is that there is no way to obtain any color on a modern linen through a 3-4 millimeters layer of air. Read again carefully my poor pdf: page 3 (preliminary experiment), Fig.1, samples 1 and 2. . I used a metal hotplate having in its center a rounded small 3 to 4millimeters deep depression. The temperature (not measured) was everywhere the same at the surface of the plate, including the depression. I applied firmly the linen on the plate.Is there a better way to test the effects of radiation and convection ?I concluded: “One can conclude that even with a temperature and contact time much higher than that used by the alleged forger, a true contact is necessary to obtain a color: radiant energy through air does not work.”I repeat: a contact( even a light one) is absolutely necessary to obtain even a faint discoloration.Maybe convection and or radiation could be a small part of the mechanism of fibers discoloration in contact areas when a hot template is applied on a linen: but what does it change?There must be a contact and the overall result is always problematic.I have now to work on the ME images pdf.

Dixon, A.V. Samudra and al. A Scanning Electron Microscope Study of Dried Blood. Journal of Forensic Science, Oct.1976, Vol. 21, N°4, 797-803)..In particular, samples of blood smears, crusts and dried blood on cloth (up to 7 years old) andgraphite were analyzed after subtraction of the spectra generated by the substrate.We must remember that the peak heights in the qualitative EDXRA spectra can not be directlyrelated to the actual amounts of the measured species.All the blood spectra showed a characteristic pattern: Chlorine (Cl), Sulphur (S) andPotassium (K) peaks predominate in nearly the same ratio.Blood on cloth gave the following results, in % (rounded): Cl: 22-27, S: 12-22, K: 11-23, Si:7-17, Ca: 5-14, P: 0.4-13, Al: 1-9, Na: 0-5, Mg: 1-3, Fe: 0-2. Although the data are presented differently (% vs. peaks heights), the comparison with theEDXRA data of the 10 “blood” shards on the Shroud is interesting:– For the 3 major peaks of real blood: Cl on Shroud is consistent with blood, S is present butthe actual peak count on the Shroud is unknown (see vermilion Hg/S chapter below) and thevery small peak of K seems not compatible with K in whole blood. However, Adler gives apossible explanation for this fact (see below).– The counts for Si and Al relative to Cl in the Shroud “blood” shards are not inconsistentwith the relative percentages of the same elements in real blood. Therefore, one can noteliminate blood on the basis of their presence in the “blood” shards on the Shroud as it hasbeen claimed.– Ca is also found in blood at a level roughly consistent with what is found in the Shroud“blood”, and the small excess could come from the calcium bound to the cellulose.– The iron peak height of whole blood in EDXRA spectra is surprisingly low: there is muchmore Fe in the Shroud red shards than expected for whole blood.

The best one.There are also the pictures from Fanti in our paper about superficiality… ”  Indeed, in the paper you cite [My paper], we are really told very little about the microscopic character of the individual image fibres of the Shroud except that they are uniformly pale yellow, with no burnt bits, and those yellow fibres can be adjacent to non-yellowed (the well-known half-tone effect)”The half-tone effect has nothing to do with the observed fact that “yellow fibers” can be adjacent to non-yellowed fibers.The half-tone effects actually means that the color density of a given image area depends only on the numbers of yellowed fibers in a given image area and does not depend on the color of the individual fibers. All the image fibers have the same yellowish color (+/- 10%).“But there is the crucial observation that scorched fibres are brittle, and putting that together with the evidence from Fanti et al elsewhere that Shroud image fibres fracture more easily than non-image fibres, there is an alternative explanation for the uniformly yellow fibres and the so-called half-tone effect, namely that we are now seeing only those very lightly scorched fibres (regardless of scorching mechanism) that have survived to this day without breaking and falling off.

Even in his own micrograph, presumably chosen carefully to illustrate his point, there is hardly any darkening of the lumen visible. Had the fragment that does appear darkened been photographed at X200 (like the image fibre next to it) it may not have shown any dark middle at all. This is not an important reason to exclude the scorch hypothesis. The fluorescence thing, I think, is the true cruncher.”Rogers wrote: ” When viewed in parallel light under a microscope, a scorched fiber (Fig VI-I) is colored through its entire diameter, and the medulla (..)usually appears to be darker than the mass of the fiber as a result of reactions at its surface and its shorter radius of curvature. The medullas of image fibers do not show any coloration or charring (figure VI-2). Image-fiber medullas are usually clean and colorless”.The fact that Rogers compared LIGHTLY scorched fibers with an UNUSUALLY DEEPLY COLORED IMAGE FIBER is the main point.No doubt that Rogers did look carefully at the samples he had. The figures in his book are only shown as an example of his observations performed on many fibers from the Shroud. The term “usually” is important. You wrote that the lumen in your own scorch experiments are not always darkened. What is the difference between “usually” (Rogers) and “not always” (you)?It should be interesting to look at your own experiments.Where did you find scorched fibers without darkened lumen ?Colin (#45): “But there is the crucial observation that scorched fibres are brittle, and putting that together with the evidence from Fanti et al elsewhere that Shroud image fibres fracture more easily than non-image fibres, there is an alternative explanation for the uniformly yellow fibres and the so-called half-tone effect, namely that we are now seeing only those very lightly scorched fibres (regardless of scorching mechanism) that have survived to this day without breaking and falling off. One can hardly expect the modern day experimentalist to reproduce image-forming mechanisms AND the effect of centuries of ageing and disintegration.”Yes, no doubt that scorched fibers are brittle.However, the burned and scorched fibers from the 1532 fire do not show any kind of disintegration (you will see that tomorrow).Moreover, I don’t think that the pilgrims and the Authorities could be fooled by a scorch imprint.

I have transformed the original color photo (the best one available) into a grey-scale photo because the famous ‘banding effect’ is much more easy to see. Note that in this first photo I did not enhance the contrast.The second photograph (http://imgur.com/IDrEi7E) focus on the area of interest (the so-called ‘non imaged zone’) along the ulnar side (not radial, sorry Anoxie) of the upper hand. This time it’s contrast enhanced.Here is a link to the first photograph with some markers in order to help you to see and understand what follows:1) This zone has definitely an almost perfect triangular shape.Why?Because it is at the intersection of two light bands: A and B (the vertical band B being much more easy to see than the horizontal band A).When a light band intersects another one in the image the image density is lower.This has been shown by Rogers and the pictures shown here demonstrate that very clearly.The fact that the area in question has an abnormal triangular shape strongly suggests that the banding effect occurs.2) Is there an faint image in this area?The main difficulty is to know how would a non imaged zone appear in this area?. In other words what is the standard density of a ‘non-image’ (‘background-only density’) in this particular area?I have no definitive answer. However, since the triangular zone pertains to band B, It seems reasonable to take it as a non image density standard for this band. In this case, the triangular area being slightly darker than the standard ‘non-image’ reference might be an evidence (not a proof) that the so-called ‘non imaged zone’ bears in fact a very faint image, almost invisible because of the banding effect.3) The statement 2 above is heightened by the fact that the adjacent areas C and D are clearly imaged.4) The so-called gasps between the fingers. If gasp means ‘no image at all’ this is false.There is clearly a faint image and no ‘gasp’ between the fingers. The main question is: ‘contact-only’ (whatever the method) or ‘contact+action at distance’ in order to explain the TS image.This post does not answer but at least it shows that thinks are not as simple as some people think.More later.","date":"July 21, 2014 at 2:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

Yes “gasp” must be read “gaps”.You, CB wrote:““This zone has an almost perfect triangular shape”.What is a “perfect triangle” in the context of the TS image? Perfect in what sense? The term “perfect” is meaningless if all one is doing is looking for banding effects that can only emphasize two out of three sides of one’s “perfect” triangle, i.e. the vertical and horizontal, but NOT the hypotenuse. ”You can not seriously extract a short sentence out of its context. The hypotenuse  side obviously consists of a strong image. Do you really think I/we are so stupid ?   “This entire comment is pseudo-geometry: it tries to explain away the region of interest as an artifact of banding. It is nothing of the sort.”Not at all.The question is: is there a faint image in that area? I only wished to show that one can not answer without taking into account the banding effect because there is an obvious correlation between the borders of this “non imaged area” and a very bright large vertical band .CB: ” Oh, and did Ray Rogers RIP really say that “when one light band intersects another one in the image the image density is lower”? I hope not, since in terms of what makes an image darker or lighter (presence or absence of pigment or coloured pixels) that statement would be profoundly unscientific.”See:http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers5faqs.pdf“In ultraviolet-fluorescence photographs (see Hands UV). Both warp and weft yarns show this property. Some areas show darker warp yarns and some show darker weft yarns. In some places bands of darker color cross. In other places bands of lighter color cross. The effect is somewhat like a plaid”.  And: “Anna Maria Donadoni, a curator at the Museum of Egyptology in Turin, pointed out locations where batches of yarn ended in the weave and new yarn had been inserted in order to continue weaving. The yarn ends were laid side byside, and the weave was compressed with the comb. The ends are often visible, and the overlaps correspond to zones of different color in the weave. The different batches of yarn show different colors.Where darker bands of yarn intersect image areas, the image is darker. Where lighter bands intersect an image area, the image appears lighter. This proves that the image color is not a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen.Some impurities on the surface of the different batches of yarn produced the image color. This observation is extremely important when tests are being made on image-formation hypotheses. If image color is not simply a result of colorformation in the cellulose of the linen fibers, image formation must be a much more complex process than we originally thought.”Hugh: thank you for your comments.There are different kinds of bands on the TS.More later.","date":"July 22, 2014 at 4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

Not vague stains but the precise imprint of the nose, the eyes, the fingers etc…I am a medieval forger. But I understand that I can’t paint the image like a normal painting, an albedo.I am thinking about this problem. I have the solution. To paint the most prominent parts of the body (nose..) more heavily than the other parts. In other words, to correlate the image intensity with the body/shroud distance or with the body/shroud contact pressure. Eureka !!This hypothesis has been tested many years ago by Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline( “Three dimensional characteristics of the Shroud image”, IEEE Proceedings, October 1982 and “Correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with 3-D structure of a human body shape”, Applied Optics, Vol.23, N° 14, 15 July 1984).” Four our experiment, we secured the assistance of two certified criminal artists …compose realistic, monotone imagery, qualities found in the shroud image. In one set of experiments, we asked the artists to “freehand” shade an image of a given reference face ..in proportion to relief. In a second set, we provided the artists with relief data at 15 specific ‘anchor’ points on the face.. The artists then constructed an encoder by which they could convert distance information into shading. This encoder was a continuum of shades which correspond to various relief distances”.The result? None of the pictures do show the 3D characteristics of the shroud body image.To summarize:1) There is no example of a “negative” image in the history of painting2) Even modern artists failed to produce the characteristics of the TS body image (particularly the 3D characteristics) How could your medieval painter produce a negative image with the 3D characteristics of the TS body image?Your medieval painter was not only a genius but a magician.","date":"January 15, 2015 at 3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/15/there-is-another-reason-charles-freeman-is-wrong/","cat":"image_theory","title":"There is another reason Charles Freeman is wrong"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Dear Hugh,I am very surprised.You’ll find the original paper here:https://app.box.com/s/m0uhcjdn9m40ao95pky8p7iomtfcnx8cThe reference face is obviously the same as in your BBC report.Unfortunately, there is no picture of the positive or negative paintings in the above paper.However, none of the VP8 pictures (Fig.12 to Fig.17 in the paper) is similar to your BBC VP8 image.

We tried several materials that we know from past experience degrade cellulose in this way, and in the end we settled for alum, a material widely used by artists in medieval times.”They tried to find some painting medium that degrades cellulose without living any trace.(The sentence about calcium is meaningless since calcium is present everywhere on the shroud).Alum ?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlumWhat kind of Alum ?Alum (or more exactly Alums) is a complex class of chemical compounds.None of the numerous trivalent metals found in Alums has been found in the body image.It seems that Alums are soluble in water. This is not the case for the body image.““Having settled on alum to degrade the cloth, Susan [Hilton, the artist] had to find a pigment, so she could see what she was painting. She chose brazil wood, often used with alum, and so popular in the middle ages that they even named a country after it. … For a canvas she used modern linen cloth that was specially woven to be like the real Shroud. That was sized with gum arabic, which contains calcium. … Finally a mixture of more gum arabic and alum was the medium to take the brazil wood pigment. The rest was up to Susan’s artistic skill.”Brazil Wood ?  “Starting in the 16th centuries, brazilwood became highly valued in Europe and quite difficult to get. A related wood Sappanwood coming from Asia was traded in powder form and used as a red dye in the manufacture of luxury textiles, such as velvet, in high demand during the Renaissance. When Portuguese navigators discovered present-day Brazil, on April 22, 1500, they immediately saw that brazilwood was extremely abundant along the coast and in its hinterland, along the rivers”Gum Arabic?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_arabic“Gum arabic is used as a binder for watercolor painting because it dissolves easily in water. Pigment of any color is suspended within the acacia gum in varying amounts, resulting in watercolor paint.”It dissolves easily in water…“And the finished product goes off for a bit of aging. [Cloth placed in an oven at 190°C for an unspecified time] We know that in the 15th century the Shroud was washed, in order, they believed, to test its authenticity. They probably used soda ash to get rid of those stubborn stains, like alum and brazil wood. [Cloth boiled in a large beaker]”. Somewhere, there is an historical reference to this event (Colin?)But the Shroud show absolutely no evidence of this event.To the contrary, there are no clue of this (alleged) event and there are many proofs of the contrary. Do you really think that the Shroud was boiled, without living any trace of this violent event?” Well, there’s the result. Looks good at a distance, and the closer you get, the less you see. [Close up] Tests showed that chemically everything was washed away except calcium and iron, and under the microscope the effect is strictly on the surface. It’s all very like the real Shroud. But the 3D test still has to be passed. Viewed from this side [The side with the epsilon blood mark], the real Shroud looks a bit better than Susan’s painting, but turn the other cheek [Image rotated slowly through about 100°] and there’s very little difference.

Both terms mean the body image which is described as some kind of imprint.The five wounds (blood) are included into the  “imprimure”.It seems that the medieval witnesses could not understand the difference between the (positive) blood marks and the (negative) body image.For them, both “imprints” were the result of the same process (some kind of imprint).We now know that it is not true.

I am glad to read that some of my observations were also found by Rogers particularly this one: “Microscopy proves that image fibers and scorch fibers are quite different in structure and composition. The distribution of color is different, even at the level of single fibers.”.  However, Rogers’ observations were made on scorched fibers of the TS (from the 1532 fire) and therefore were not necessarily relevant to the scorch hypothesis as a result of the conscious choice of a forger.Testing a hypothesis is a construction.

In other words has anyone produced a heightmap?”Yes and no.This has been done by Jackson and al. in ” Three dimensional characteristics of the Shroud Image” in Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society, October 1982″ (16 pages).They first used the “Small Sample Correlation Technique”:” Our procedure for measuring the degree of correlation between image shading and cloth-body distance involved first measuring the transmittance of a black and white transparency of the face taken of the Shroud in 1978 by a microdensitometer. We chose to sample 13 image locations: tip of nose, edges of nose, cheek, eyes, eye sockets, bridge of nose, lips, mustache, and forehead (…)Next we measured cloth-body distance by draping a linen model of the Shroud, hand-woven as to correspond with the herringbone weave and thickness of the Shroud, over a bearded volunteer subject. Side photographs were made with the cloth in place and then after immediately being removed. By superimposing these photographs and using contours gadges (…)we determined cloth-body distances (…)We then plotted these data of transmittance and cloth-body distance and determined a linear regression line (…)The measured coefficient of determination, r2, was 0.60 for the 13 data points, at the 95% confidence level, which implies that the actual coefficient of determination, lies between 0.20 and 0.83. Through the range is quite large owing to the small number of data points available, some observations can nevertheless be made. First the null hypothesis [no correlation] is excluded, indicating that some image correlation with image shading and cloth-body distance is present (……..)The reliability in the measurements of [the coefficient of determination] could be increased if more data points were sampled. We can estimate the numbers, n, of datapoints required (..).We calculate the number of data points to be 1700. (..) This value of 1700 is prohibitive by the manual sampling technique discussed above, but may be possible via some automated sampling algorithms.”“Relief Image TechniqueAlthough we have not as yet developed an adequate large number sampling algorithm, we have studied the Shroud image with another technique that allows visual estimation of how well image shading correlates with distance.”: the VP8.Then, in this paper, the authors described in detail, step by step and with many experiments how and why the VP8 can be used to estimate the reliability of the “cloth-body distance hypothesis”.They concluded:” These results demonstrate that image shading on the Shroud correlates with distance between 2 surfaces, one of which can be interpreted as a body shape and the other as a cloth draping over that body surface. Logically, this does not prove that a cloth was draped over a body shape when the Shroud image was formed because other hypotheses not involving a cloth covered body shape might conceivably account for such an effect. (..)“Thus we may refer to the Shroud image as having a “three dimensional characteristic” which means, simply, that image shading can be self-consistently interpreted as being correlated with the distance between a body an an enveloping cloth.”And finally they tested many image formation hypothesis using this “technique”:” (..) A correct hypothesis of image formation must be able to produce an image structure capable of a “three dimensional interpretation”, for in doing so the shading distribution of the shroud image would be duplicated”.This paper is THE fundamental study of the “3-D interpretation” of the TS image.Everybody who wants to discuss seriously must read it carefully.I had to read it carefully at least 3 times to understand the logic of the reasoning.For me, the reasoning seems to be irrefutable.Is it ?You can ask me for this paper.","date":"November 30, 2013 at 5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Dear Hugh,Yes I read this blog from time to time.About your question 4), no it is not true to state that Fanti   “was not willing at all to even mention Rogers’ impurity hypothesis” until forced to do so?”I repeat : this paper was not mainly about the chromophore but an attempt to explain what is the superficiality of the TS image at fabric, thread and fiber level.","date":"September 9, 2013 at 3:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/05/thoughts-on-the-thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/maillard_i__my_paper.pdfPlease read again this paper.Anoxie wrote: “I doubt it could be a post mortem change – hairs don’t decompose – it was slowly produced on the skin and hairs in the tomb.

Using hints from various sources, I have prepared linen by dripping molar solutions of sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide on it.

This leaves us open to a couple of experimental directions: firstly, that the image could have been created by scorching, but at a much lower temperature than we normally call “scorching,” and secondly that a latent image could have been created by contact with an acid (possibly paint based) or an alkali (possibly biologically based), and the image ‘developed’ by age, heat, or a combination of the two.”I do not understand why you used sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide on the linen.Do you think that a medieval forger used this kind of highly complex process ?Or did I miss something ?My opinion is the same: the scorch hypothesis does not explain the TS image.However, Colin provides some precise details that have to be tested.I have some ideas to test Colin’s ideas at thread and fabric level.However, I am interested in your ideas.","date":"March 14, 2014 at 4:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/two-comments-promoted-colin-berry-has-cracked-the-shroud-enigma/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Two Comments Promoted:  Colin Berry Has Cracked the Shroud Enigma?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Thank you Antero.Dear Hugh, you wrote:“The scorch hypothesis has not been disproved by Heimburger at all.

In other words, the radiant energy of the heat is unable to color the linen even at a distance of 3-4 millimeters of the source.This is very important. Why ?Because it is absolutely impossible (in the context of the Shroud) to have a perfect contact everywhere, particularly in the face area.

Heavy deeper scorches affect the cellulose in the core of the fibre, requiring a considerably higher temperature, and generating the monomers that are needed for polymerization on the graphite pathway terminating in charcoal that are responsible for intermediate uv fluorescence.”I am unable to discuss the chemistry, but Colin’s reasoning (as quoted above) has nothing to do with the question. We are not discussing about heavy scorches versus light scorches.The problem is entirely that of light scorches.The color of the margins of the scorches on the TS (light scorch) has the same color and  the same reflectance spectra than the color and the spectra of the TS image.But these light scorches on the TS do fluoresce while the TS image does not.Moreover, up to know, any kind of light scorch on linen (Pellicori experiments, Hugh experiments) shows that a light scorch on linen always produces a fluorescent “image”.It means that the TS image has many properties similar to a light scorch but that it is not a light scorch.","date":"December 17, 2014 at 6:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Thanks Colin for your replay.Of course I understand your reasoning.

There was no splicing, and no linen, in the tiny sample Villarreal examined. ‘Not at all.In 2008, on the basis of FTIR spectra, Villareal found that threads coming from the Raes samples were cotton threads, not linen. The spectra of the threads as well as the spectra of individual fibers were similar to the spectra of cotton and very different from the spectra of flax.

I agreement with Rogers, I concluded that the ratio of cotton vs flax is strongly anomalous with regard to the main part of the Shroud.No more, no less.

However, processing/aging of linen can dramatically change its spectralcharacteristics. This make it very difficult to conclusively identify an unknown sample’.It means that his previous 2008 FTIR experiments, comparing modern linen and modern cotton, were not reliable.It means that his 2008 ‘cotton-like’ spectra could be the spectra of aged and/or processed linen.However, this has nothing to do with the splice found in Raes 1.Raes 1 is truly a splice with a terpene-like crust.This fact found by Rogers and confirmed by Villareal in 2008 is NOT refuted by Villareal’s 2014 paper.","date":"February 27, 2015 at 5:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Thanks to you Hugh.SPLICE.According to the late (and wonderful) Sue Benford, there are 3 kinds of splice (“All general splicing information was obtained from:YARN CLEARING, KNOTTING AND SPLICING, M. Anbarasan, Premier PolytronicsLtd., Coimbatore, India”).“Wrapping: The tail end of each yarn strand is tapered and terminates with few fibers. The tail end makes a good wrapping of several turns and thus prevents fraying of the splice. Thefibers of the twisting yarn embrace the body of the yarn and thus acts as a belt. This inturn gives appearance to the splice.Twisting:The two yarn ends comprising the splice are twisted around the body of the yarn, eachyarn strand twists on the body of the yarn on either side of the middle of the splice. Thecross-section of this region distinctly shows the fibers of the two yarn strands separatelywithout any intermingling of the fibers.Tucking /InterminglingThe middle portion of the splice is a region (2-5 mm) with no distinct order. The fibersfrom each yarn end intermingle in this splice zone just by tucking.”I have the Powerpoint 2008 Villareal  presentation. I have been able to measure accurately the 2 pieces of Raes 1 because one of the slides shows them clearly with a scale bar.Piece 1 (with the frayed ends): 6.9 mmPiece 2: 3.5 mm.Total: 10.4 mm=1.4 cm which is exactly the length of the whole piece of thread as written by Benford and Marino (probably from Rogers).The crust is about 3.75 mm. in length.We must conclude that Raes 1 is not a “twisting”.Unfortunately, my English is not good enough and I am unable to understand clearly the definitions of “Wrapping” and “Tucking”.You wrote previously: ” Robert Villarreal found two pieces of cotton thread, not just fibres, butt-joined together by the crust of terpene.”At least you agree that Raes 1 is  comprised of two pieces joined together, but I do not understand “butt-joined together”.Can you explain what you have in mind and the possible relationship between your claim and the wrapping and/or tucking splicing techniques ?Incidentally, it is very amazing that, looking at the photographs of Raes 1, it is impossible to see the boundary between Piece 1 and Piece 2. However Rogers found it and described Raes 1 as an END TO END unique splice.   COTTONYou wrote: “Only now, 6 years later, do we have a presentation attempting to show that old linen spectra look like cotton spectra anyway, so the FTIR analysis is worthless. However, they do not show that Villarreal’s findings were wrong, only that “it is possible that the thread composition varied from one end to the other, consistent with the slicing hypothesis.”And:   “Raes 7 and Raes 14 did not fall apart, were not splices, and were also cotton.”Yes, unfortunately, the previous 2008 FTIR analysis is worthless.The best way to analyse a fiber is polarized microscopy.I can tell you with certainty that Raes 7  is comprised of a majority of flax fibers mixed with many cotton fibers, in agreement with Rogers.Oxford found some cotton fibers at the surface of  his sample.I have to repeat that, following my own knowledge of Raes 7, it  is truly impossible to know the true composition of a thread without  unraveling it.To my knowledge, Oxford never performed this kind of experiment (and it is understandable).","date":"February 28, 2015 at 5:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Hugh,“Gonella reported that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample.”This cannot be true, can it?The threads came from the border of the ‘Reserve’See my papers:http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerpaper.pdfhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerppt.pdfQuestions?","date":"February 28, 2015 at 5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I don’t take offence of your statements.It’s true that I am not an expert on textile.The aim of my paper about Raes 7 was only to have a better knowledge of the number and the location of the flax fibers in Raes 7.For that, you don’t need to be an expert on textile.

This is nonsense. He said that the C14 corner is a mixture of “old” linen threads mixed with “new” linen+cotton threads, suggesting a repair.”  Due to the lack of documentation pertaining to the threads’ chain of custody, Rogers’ contemporaries questioned the threads authenticity and his research findings.

The light and dark ‘bands’ do extend into the hair.Moreover there are also some horizontal bands which are clearly seen in some photographs that also impacts on the TS image density.The banding effect is not an illusion.Whatever the imaging process,the TS image,as we see it, is the result of the interaction between the “template” (“dead body, bas relief, painting or whatever”) and the cloth.I strongly suspect that the “banding effect” is one of the keys of the understanding of the TS image.However, I have no time enough to study it in depth for the moment.

Here we are speaking of the alternated regular light and dark vertical bands.You have shown that these bands are clearly connected to the herringbone weave of the fabric. I fully agree and some weeks ago I also discovered the same fact in the hands area.The light bands on both sides of the TS man face are connected to the herringbone weave ( ‘pitch’) of the fabric.   “So the light vertical areas defining the sides of the cheeks are really present, but they are not as precise or as well defined as they appear, and are not merely artifacts of the cloth, but real areas where the image making process just didn’t happen.”How can you conclude that in those areas “the image making process just didn’t happen.”See:http://thierrycastex.blogspot.fr/2012/04/filtrage-dans-le-domaine-de-fourier.htmland:http://thierrycastex.blogspot.fr/2012_05_01_archive.htmland:Thierry Castex is a true expert in imaging techniques.From Castex and your studies, one can conclude:1) there is an image in these light vertical areas.2) The light vertical bands are closely related to the herringbone weave3) If you exclude the effect of the weave, you obtain a much more realistic image.Now, the true question is: how can we explain the relationship between the herringbone weave and the image ?","date":"August 30, 2014 at 2:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/29/more-about-banding-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More about banding on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I am disappointed.I provided the pictures and what ?So many “comments” without any kind of connection to the subject !There are so many questions without  answer.

This is particularly true for the amido black test used by McCrone who even “strongly stained pure cellulose (viscose rayon), and even more strongly stained the heated and scorched Spanish linen controls” (one of the  control they used). They found that the most sensitive and specific test was the fluorescamine test: “The best suited protein reagent tested was fluorescamine. While specific for primary amino groups, it has been reported to detect one ng of protein by the generation of a characteristic green fluorescence under long wave UV. Control tests confirmed that it would do so under our test conditions”.I have verified in the scientific literature the quoted sensitivity of this test and its high specificity for the primary amino groups.The conclusion: ” Positive fluorescamine tests were obtained on both the red and golden yellow coated fibrils, on the shards, and on both the orange and brown globs. The fluorescamine tests were definitely negative on ALL fibrils away from blood areas. This includes specifically yellow (body image) fibrils .. Thus, protein is only found associated with ‘blood’ areas and is definitely not present as a ‘pigment binder’ in the body image above the nanogram level”.It is clear that H and A tested fibrils from blood areas, image area and background for primary amino groups which are the basic chemical structure of proteins.There is no protein residue in the background and no protein residue in the image-only areas.This alone is sufficient to rule out the “gesso” hypothesis.A “new” paint hypothesis must take into account all the known scientific data.More generally, I see more and more attacks against STURP’ s work by people who obviously did not read their fundamental peer-reviewed papers.","date":"December 7, 2014 at 3:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I agree Hugh.But there are several evidence that the shroud is truly a burial sheet.This is the problem.","date":"December 7, 2014 at 3:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Some comments:Colin: “There’s a serious problem in identifying a red stain as real whole blood, ancient or otherwise, if there’s no strong signal for potassium (or sodium) relative to background.”I’am not sure that you have the Morris and Al. original paper.On the Shroud they only found Calcium, Iron and Strontium.They found “the excess iron concentration in the foot ‘blood’ region ..above background..”In order to know if this iron concentration is consistent with that of blood, they measured whole blood iron concentrations in a Whatman 42 paper saturated with whole blood.Then they wrote: ” In these measurements [measurements made on the Whatman paper]  we also observed potassium in addition to Iron. The K peak intensity was typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than the K-alpha . Although no potassium was observed in any of the shroud data, poor signal to noise ratios may preclude definite conclusions on the point”.They did not find potassium in blood shroud areas but with the SAME laboratory apparatus they used in Turin they found a potassium signal “at least an order of magnitude” smaller than that of Fe on a paper saturated with whole blood. This explains their conclusion.The question of potassium in bloodstains versus background on the shroud has nothing to do with the paper in question.David:““Neither Frache/Modena (negative), nor McCrone (negative), nor Adler&Heller (positive), nor Baima Bollone (positive) were scientific archaeologists.

Rogers found that the thickness of the carrier of the color was about 0.2-0.6 micrometerComposition : mainly hemicellulose. Traces of pectin and lignin. The energy necessary to change the chemical properties of hemicellulose (and to color it) is much lower than that of cellulose, the main component of the secondary cell wall (more than 90 % of the thickness of a flax fiber).I repeat : all the facts are consistent with both possibilities.Yannick wrote :    For example, can someone give me a solid and credible scientific explanation for the FACT that the ghost and the diimide leave a clean uncolored and undamaged fiber behind ? At first sight, that doesn’t seem to really fit with the idea that the primary cell wall would have been colored instead of a thin layer of impurities on top of the fibers !!! If the color would be in the primary cell wall, then the ghosts would be composed mainly of a dehydrated and oxidized primary cell wall that surely would have left a DAMAGED fiber behind. You understand what I mean ?”First Yannick, the ghosts could not live a clear uncolored and undamaged fiber behind because the “ghosts”, by definition, were not attached to any fiber.Second, I don’t understand your sentence “the ghost and the diimide leave a clean uncolored fiber behind”.Diimide was in fact used by Adler on colored fibers among 21 solvents employed in dye extraction tests. Only hydrazine (very slowly) and diimide (a strong powerful reducing agent) could bleach the yellow color of image fibers.This test only show that the color is not a dye and that the color is only at the surface of the fiber. Rogers wrote clearly :” Up until this time, we had assumed that the image color was a result of chemical changes IN the cellulose of the linen; The most likely change would involve the dehydration of the cellulose to produce conjugated double bonds system. Adler’s observations strongly suggested that the cellulose was not involved in image formation”.If the color is only in the pcw, you’ll find exactly the same result because the pcw is a thin surface layer. The cellulose is not involved. The fact that diimide leaves undamaged fibers behind shows only that it can not destroy or modify the strong cellulosic structure of the secondary cell wall. It is not surprising. But, because diimide is able to bleach the colored fibers,  the chromophore carrier is likely a non-cellulosic structure at the very surface of the fiber. No more no less.It is the same for all the other properties found by the STURP, Rogers etc..regarding the chemistry of the image. To my knowledge there is no known fact able to distinguish between the 2 possibilities.However the fact is that Rogers never wrote the world primary cell wall. Why ?Here we must remember that he was fascinated by the ( true ) fact that the image appears to be more dense in the dark bands than in the light bands. He thought that the bands seen on the Shroud could be explained if there were more impurities left after washing and bleaching in the dark bands than in the light bands.Therefore everything makes sense : dark bands = thick impurity layer = dense image.ALL the impurity layer hypothesis is based on this hypothesis.But the fact is that this hypothesis is very controversial.For example, many textile experts think that the bands can be explained by the heterogeneity of the density of the threads (something which is often observed in ancient fabrics).Dark bands = more threads = more fibers = more “pcw” = dense image and vice versa.In my opinion, Rogers did not even think about the pcw as a possible color carrier because he found very early a complete reliable hypothesis able to explain all the observed facts. This is human.But recently, on the basis of the description of the pcw by some experts, we found (in SSG) that all the known microscopic, macroscopic and chemical properties could be explained if the image were the result of some kind of dehydration-oxydation of the hemicellulose found in the pcw.Both hypotheses are possible but the pcw hypothesis does not necessarily imply the complex process required to explain the impurity layer.","date":"May 13, 2012 at 4:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"I am not the moderator of this blog.But Yannick did use words like “pseudo-scientists” , “gang” or …”infamous”.Regarding the JIST (PEER REVIEWED) “infamous” paper (the co-authors are Fanti, Botella, Di Lazzaro, Schneider, Svensson and myself), Yannick is completely wrong.He wrote : ” because this paper is clearly an attempt to push the primary cell wall hypothesis and almost tried, at the same time, to discredit Rogers hypothesis, than I consider it as infamous.” and “And because this paper pushed so hard the issue in favor of the primary cell wall hypothesis, it is clearly an attempt to comfort the hypothesis of Fanti about the image formation process, i.e. the corona discharge (because an electric discharge like that can color just the primary cell wall of a fiber, just like UV light also can).This is not true.The only sentence regarding Fanti’s corona discharge is found ( in the discussion part of the paper ) in the sentence:  :”Fanti proposed an alternate image formation mechanism based on Corona Discharge that may be able to theoretically explain all the characteristics detected on the TS image, but is not able to reproduce all of them in a laboratory because the intensity of the required energy source is too high”.No more.I would like to participate in this discussions but not on this basis","date":"May 15, 2012 at 4:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"And now?Now we have another proof that the TS image has not been yet reproduced and remains a challenge.CB: ” Note the relative absence of lateral distortion.” Are you serious ?

However, as a true scientist, he wanted to verify specifically this point.Later, he could obtain 2 tiny pieces of threads coming from the center of the C14 dated sample. He could confirm the presence of dye as well as the very high amount of cotton in these 2 threads. To my knowledge, for some reasons (lack of time or smallness of the samples or..) he did not perform the test for the vanillin on these C14 pieces of thread.Shortly, Rogers’s discoveries re the anomalous characteristics of the Raes/C14 corner came from the detailed study of an arguably representative genuine sample (Raes piece 1). He confirmed them on 2 small pieces from the center of the C14 sample. Those pieces were truly from the center of the C14 sample and there is a clear “chain of custody”, although unpublished for understandable reasons.One can discuss endless each of his observations but taking them together they point to the only scientifically acceptable contestation of the C14 results.I agree that it’s difficult to accept knowing the opposite conclusions of the textile experts (F.Testore, G. Vial and M. Flury-Lemberg).But read carefully what follows:My friend journalist Brice Perrier, after a detailed investigation wrote a book in 2011: “Qui a peur du Saint Suaire ?” (in French, Ed. Florent Massot, 2011). This is simply the best serious investigation that includes many interviews of most people (pro and cons) involved in the TS.He wrote (p.126):“I went to see one who was recommended to me by both archaeologists and Lyon textile museum experts as the best expert in ancient fabrics, Christophe Moulherat.”Brice told me that, at the time, Moulherat did not know that the C14 samples came from a single location rather than from three different locations as he thought. He was shocked and added (p.242): “for this kind of fabric, I would have at least chosen to test separately warp and weft threads coming from at least two different locations”  Brice: “I asked him if there were actually invisible repairs.[Moulherat’s answer]:‘No, they can be seen if you have the means to see them. Just do a thorough analysis. But for that, you must have access to the fabric and do not look to the naked eye because there you’ll see nothing (..).You need microscopes.If one has tampered threads with the desire to hide something, you have to think about that before and you have to be equipped to see that. Otherwise, if the repair is well done you can miss it. You really need a detailed analysis’.G. Vial and F. Testore are/were beyond any doubt competent textile experts but the conditions of the C14 sampling were far from those necessary to detect a repair.","date":"August 7, 2014 at 8:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/05/5050-colin-berrys-most-outlandish-proposal/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"50/50  :  Colin Berry’s Most Outlandish Proposal"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"AnoxieNo, I did’nt try to contact Di Costanzo.Brice did it and all what you wrote is true (this is in Brice’s book).","date":"August 7, 2014 at 12:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/05/5050-colin-berrys-most-outlandish-proposal/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"50/50  :  Colin Berry’s Most Outlandish Proposal"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Paulette is right.I am currently working on the “scorch hypothesis” with various parameters.I previously wrote that it is impossible to obtain a faint discoloration of the heated side without a (fainter) discoloration of the reverse side.

Otherwise he would have seen than the major part of it is dealing with the microscopical characteristics of ANY KIND  of scorch at fabric and thread level and not with the problem of contrast or relief.Because my model has no slightly rounded relief, CB thinks that all my observations and photographs are not reliable.Does CB think that with a slightly rounded relief rather than with a flat template, the microscopical characteristics of the color distribution (and all my observations) at fabric, thread and fiber level should be very different ?In order to produce an imprint one have to apply a hot surface on the linen.I did it with the kind of “crudest bas-relief” I used because it was the only mean to test different temperatures, different pressures and different contact times.Using a “better” bas-relief (in the sense of CB), one can certainly obtain a better “image” but its characteristics at fabric, thread and fiber level cannot be different than the characteristics showed in my paper because the fundamental mechanisms are similar.And in any case, these characteristics are very different from those observed on the Shroud.

Please give me your estimate of the proportion of the total sample submitted to the labs that was cotton. Your own estimates suggest it was very small and not enough to sway the date significantly.But if there was also linen in the reweave, then why did there need to be cotton as well?I have never bought the Rogers thesis because it does not make sense to me but perhaps you can enlighten me.So that is my problem and any clear answers would be much appreciated!”Barrie has already answered: cotton is known to retain the dye much more than linen.The presence of the dye in this area is an indisputable fact. So the presence of cotton makes sense.If there is a repair, we are necessarily speaking of threads. The new pieces of threads were SPUN  with a mixture of linen and cotton so that they looked like the threads of the Shroud (thickness, Z twist etc..). The only thing the weaver could not imitate was the sepia color of the surrounding fabric. This might explain the dye and consequently the cotton.Regarding the proportion of “new threads” versus “old threads” I can not answer since I do not know when the repair had been performed. If, as Sue Benford (RIP) and Joe Marino suggested the repair was made during the 16th century the proportion of “new threads” is about 66%. If the repair was made in the 19th century (see Max post) the proportion of “new threads” is of course much lower.You wrote: “The problem is that no one has yet found that cotton THREAD was interwoven with linen in the specific samples used by the radiocarbon labs. I have not seen as yet a piece of weave from the Shroud with the cotton threads shown interwoven with the linen. What Raes found was cotton fibres that he though had drifted in from a previous weave.”What do you mean exactly by “interwoven”?There is NO cotton THREAD either in the main part of the Shroud or in the C14/Raes area. But there are at least several threads in the C14/Raes area which have an abnormal high cotton content and the cotton fibers are also found in the CORE of those threads.It means that the cotton found in those threads is likely not a contamination as described by Raes but more likely the result of a voluntary action: some of the Raes/C14 threads are “new threads” with both “new” linen and cotton fibers spun together.Gilbert Raes found some cotton fibers in his Piece 1 (from the main part of the Shroud) but no cotton in Piece 2 (from the side strip).We know that the side strip (Raes Piece 2) was woven at the same time as the main part of the Shroud and that it was actually a part of the Shroud fabric.More later..","date":"August 8, 2014 at 3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Anoxie: “who said reweaving was done exclusively with cotton ?”Charles: “No one is saying that but was reweaving done in both linen AND cotton?”Yes Charles.What is your problem ?

We could not find more than traces of cotton on the Shroud. The cloth appeared to be pure linen”.I can not add anything to my own study of Raes#7   http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part1.pdfIt is clear (at least to me) that in the same small area (Raes), there are threads with many cotton fibers (probably “new” threads) and threads without cotton fibers  (probably genuine Shroud threads).","date":"August 9, 2014 at 3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Charles: “I and others start from the opposite premise ,that what we have now is the Shroud after centuries of decay with images of a very different kind from the original creation. My interest lies in finding out what the Shroud images looked liked originally.”Yes, and it can be proved that your premise is wrong.Why don’t you comment the many true copies (copies painted from the original and very often put in contact with it (see Luigi Fossati)? Or did I miss something ?– Faintness of the image ? See the 1527 Noalejo copy (a wonder !) where it is obvious that the artist tried to reproduce the faintness and the lack of borders of the image. There are  other examples showing that the artist tried to reproduce this property with less success: Guadalupe 1588, Rome 1605(?), Rome 1643.I add that in the Museum of the Shroud in Turin, I have seen 2 months ago a small (perhaps 20 cm in length) reproduction painted on a cloth (16th or 17th century, I don’t remember).It’s obvious that the image had been painted in order to reproduce the faintness of the TS image: it is nearly invisible!Unfortunately, it’s forbidden to photograph in the museum.  – Thumbs: contrary to what you wrote elsewhere, no thumb is visible in any of the copies.– Crown of thorns: in most of the copies, it is not seen: Santiago 1585, Naples 1652, Lisbon, Laguna de Cameros 1790, Alcoy 1571. – Loincloth: it’s true that a loincloth is clearly depicted in most of the copies. In some cases it is difficult to decide if a loincloth is present or not (Alcoy 1571, Moncalieri 1634, Rome 1643). Probably not.But the oldest copy, the Lier copy as well as the Lisbon copy clearly show the rounded shapes of the buttocks. No loincloth.So what ?According to Charles, the TS is a painting from the 14th century. The image we see today is “of a very different kind from the original creation.” because of century of decay.At the beginning the image was not as faint as it is today.I do not know if it was exactly as faint as today.But I do know that during the 16th and 17th century, some artists tried to reproduce the faintness of the image.Why, if the image was not faint?At the beginning, there was a loincloth.In this case, how to explain that some of the earliest copies show the buttocks (no loincloth), exactly as we seen them today ?The loincloth was added later and then again disappeared?Is it credible ?The same is true for the crown of thorns, the thumbs etc..No, the image we see today is not very different from the original creation.The study of the copies shows that.","date":"June 13, 2015 at 4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Hugh: “If the image was barely visible, then Charles’s detractors really ought to suggest a reason for this version.

Did none of these eminent artists actually see the artefact they were representing, and did they all copy something else?”You give yourself the reason for which the TS image is clearly drawn with sharp outlines on the depictions of the Shroud during the exhibitions (engraving).The differences in posture? Legs and feet.The feet are not seen on the TS image, except the sole of the right foot on the back side.Looking at the TS from far, what do you see? Mainly the bloodstains.There are two clearly separate bloodstains on the back side.Those bloodstains are the only markers that could be seen from far during the exhibitions.Two bloodstains, two separate feet.Since the feet on the front side are not seen, most if not all of these artists did represent them the legs turned outward.The differences in apparel ?If you mean the loincloth, Charles himself gives the answer: the council of Trent.But it was not the Shroud image itself on which a loincloth was painted: do you really think that such a sacrilege could occur?No, but this explain why many of the depictions show a loincloth.Charles’ premise is entirely based on depictions which have nothing to do with the actual Shroud as seen closely and copied in the past.","date":"June 14, 2015 at 3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist"}],"resources":[{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Charles,I have your article.Some comments posted here are regrettable.

The size is not at all a problem.2) The 1613 Tempesta engraving. As Charles wrote it shows several features very different from what we see today on the TS: the Crown of thorns, the loincloth etc.There are other obvious features Charles failed to comment. For example, the fact that the shoulders of the TS man are visible on the engraving despite the fact that after the 1532 fire, the shoulders were missing.It’s enough to conclude that this engraving can not be the exact reproduction of the Shroud in 1613.The same is true for many reproductions of the Shroud. There are even post 1532 paintings that do not show the marks of the fire! See:http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi12part4.pdfWhen Charles writes: “Texts describing the Shroud confirm the accuracy of the Tempera engraving”, I ask: show the texts.3) Charles basic hypothesis is that the reproductions of the TS were accurate. More precisely the loincloth which was not present in the previous reproductions of the shroud has been painted ON the Shroud after the Council of Trent in 1563 and then disappeared with time.This is not true.There are at least two dated reproductions made AFTER the Council of Trent showing absolutely NO loincloth.See the 1643 Rome painting and the 1634 Moncalieri painting in:http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi12part4.pdfThere is also at least one post 1563 painting without evidence of a loincloth: the 1571 Alcoy painting.4) The other features are also very variable. The crown of thorns is obvious in some paintings, not clearly seen in others and absent in the 1652 Naples reproduction. The “blood belt” is not seen in most of the paintings (or perhaps included in the loincloth), or depicted as a chain, or clearly shown as blood in the 1634 Moncalieri painting. The image seems to be painted as a faint image in the 1634 and 1643 paintings, more or less faint in the 1516 Lier painting as well as in the 1571 Alloy, 1653 Cuneo and 1678 imperia paintings while in many other pictures it is not faint at all.Conclusion:The reproductions of the Shroud are very variable.Obviously, none of them can be seen as accurate representations of the Shroud whatever the epoch.Regarding the loincloth, it is possible that the 1563 Council of Trent plaid a role in the REPRESENTATIONS of the TS image. In any case, the fact that there are some paintings made before 1563 with a loincloth and some paintings made after 1563 without a loincloth shows that the loincloth could not have been painted on the Shroud because of the Council.Interestingly, when there is a loincloth, it is generally painted on the buttocks but not on the front (except for the 1653 Cuneo reproduction).This strongly suggests that the loincloth was an interpretation of the more or less rectangular area of the buttock’s image.The loincloth can not have been painted on the shroud itself.More later.","date":"October 23, 2014 at 5:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"Charles wrote:“Medieval gesso as found north of the Alps was a mixture of calcium carbonate and rabbit skin glue ( collagen) although different mixes were possible.

It is not an evidence for gesso or anything else.Lack of collagen/protein IS an evidence against the gesso hypothesis. Charles wrote:” When I submitted all the so – called blood reports I could find to a Professor of Physiology he read them and said he was totally unconvinced that this was blood but more indicative of collagen.”I wonder what are these “so-called blood reports”.Particularly, I would like to know how a collagen-based paint could match the immunological tests performed on the blood?

Was that really the top magnification available to folk like Fanti et al (2010), the list including Thibault Heimburger, because if it was, then my ageing eye sight is simply not capable of seeing the detail that is claimed to be there.”The only source? NoIn ” A Comprehensive Examination of the Various Stains and Images on the Shroud of Turin” by Jumper et Al (ACS advances in Chemistry N°205, Archaeological Chemistry III, 1984), we read:“Body-only images (…)Macroscopic Characteristics: (…):The yellowed fibrils are not yellowed continuously over their entire length. We observed a fibril that was yellow only on the part that was on the uppermost portion of the thread but lost its coloring as it left the upper portion of the thread in its normal course of following the twist to the lower portion of the thread (…)In examining the cause of the differing integrated densities of the body-only images as seen by the eye, we found that the darker portions of the image were not due to a variation of the degree of the yellowing of the fibrils, but rather to the presence or more yellowed fibrils per unit area. Thus, the extent of yellowing of a given fibril was the same, to within 10% (of full scale) of any other yellowed fibril on the basis of the microdensitometric measurements of the color micrographs. (..) In this regard, it should be noted that there are  ubiquitous examples of yellowed fibrils lying adjacent to unyellowed fibrils”.At least 3 (or 4 ?) of the 6 authors of this paper were members of the STURP team that performed the in situ observations in 1978, namely Jumper, Jackson and Pellicori (concerning Druzik, I don’t know).Thus, the “discontinuities” and the fact that bundles of colored fibrils are found adjacent to uncolored fibrils is fully confirmed.Perhaps you can see that better in Fig.20 to 23 in my pdf: the scorch hypothesis revisited…  ”   Who’s to say these features, if present, are not a characteristic of retted flax fibre that are shown up in the imaging process, but in reality are also in latent form in non-image fibres? Might those discontinuities and striations be visible in the edges of the 1532 scorched fibres too? Has anyone looked? Were they photographed at high magnification too? So much to do, so little material to work with… maybe.”Very good questions.Reviewing the Mark Evans (ME) collection disk I have, I can say that none of the 3 facts seen in the TS body-only image, i.e: striation, ” interruption” and bundles of colored fibers adjacent to uncolored fibers in a given image-only thread (how to name this property ?) is specific to the body-only image area.It is also found in light scorches and waterstains borders.What does it mean?You wrote: ” Who’s to say these features, if present, are not a characteristic of retted flax fibre that are shown up in the imaging process, but in reality are also in latent form in non-image fibres? ”Probably yes.Each of the 32 ME microphotograph I have is about 15-20 MB!!I’ll try to write a pdf with the images showing what I wrote above (There is no other mean taking into account the weight of the images).I want to collaborate with anybody who has a correct attitude.Thibault.","date":"November 11, 2013 at 4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"author":"thibault_heimburger","post":"David Goulet :I’ve been searching the internet for pics of negative photographs based on scorch images.

There is no evidence of penetration”.Do you have pictures of the reverse (non image) side of the sheet ?“Why should blood be imaged EXACTLY THE SAME in principle as other imaged areas of the body, with the image confined largely to the ribs of the weave?”Do you have Mark Evans 1978 macro photos ? If yes you’ll see that blood residues are mainly found in the furrows. More generally all the properties of the blood stains at this level (as well at microscopic level) are the exact opposite of the image-only properties.“I now find myself wondering about the key claim that the blood was transferred to the fabric before the image. How reliable is the evidence on which that view is founded? I see from an oft-cited 2004 Rogers paper that he bases his blood-first view on a simple spot test in which he applied proteolytic enzymes to the blood stains, and found that removing the stain revealed/uncovered/exposed no image under the stain. That does not strike me as conclusive evidence for anything, certainly not for a major claim re the bloodstains. I shall obviously have to dig deeper, but if in the meantime anyone knows of better evidence than a single spot test with protein-digesting enzyme, then I’d be grateful for a link. Thanks.”And the same test applied to image-only fibers did not change at all the yellow color.Incidentally, another important difference between blood and image …This test was performed by Adler and Heller under the microscope and not only on coated fibers but also on red globs, orange globs, and golden yellow coating from the golden yellow fibrils (serum).” Withing a half hour this [proteolytic] solution completely dissolved the non-birefringent red particulate fibril coatings, leaving no particulate residues; This further indicates that these particulates are blood and not Fe2O3 impregnated protein binder”.They added  “Interestingly, fibrils freed of their coatings using this technique closely resemble the NON IMAGE fibrils when viewed under phase-contrast”.No conclusion ? Really ? Do you have another explanation ? Shroud Scope is certainly a wonderful tool. But not at all for the kind of studies you are doing.Did you ever read the peer-reviewed STURP papers ?As for your “scorch” hypothesis which has been studied in depth by many researchers (including numerous experiments) many decades ago and finally dismissed.Just one of them (among many others) : the medulla of the image fibers is clear while the medulla of the lightly scorched fibers on the Shroud is colored.Please, purchase a good microscope and test your hypothesis. Being like a scorch is not the same as being a scorch.
