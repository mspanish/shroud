{"dating":[{"author":"justin","post":"Hi Hugh, thanks for the response.  I think I may have misspoke.  I was referring to the image of the back of the man on the shroud.  It seems like if the source of the image was from below the body, as it presumably would have been if it stemmed from crushing rock during an earthquake, that you would not get an image of the back of the man, but only the front of the man.  That assumes the man was laying face up, of course.  Does that make more sense?\n\n","date":"February 18, 2014 at 10:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/14/aftershock-of-the-maybe-an-earthquake-did-it-earthquake/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Aftershock of the Maybe-An-Earthquake-Did-It Earthquake"},{"author":"justin","post":"Just a question from someone just starting to study the shroud.\nThere are two claims I’ve seen related to the earthquake theory.\n1) That it possibly messes up C14 content which could lead to incorrect dating, and\n2) That the emissions possibly created the image on the cloth.\nThese two claims need not both be correct.  And temporarily granting 1, that still leaves me with a question:\nFor claim 2), how was this seriously proposed given the back and front of the shroud show frontal and dorsal images?\n\n","date":"February 17, 2014 at 2:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/14/aftershock-of-the-maybe-an-earthquake-did-it-earthquake/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Aftershock of the Maybe-An-Earthquake-Did-It Earthquake"}]}
