For all of you that have read it, my oldest daughter just had 2 of her friends within 2 days of each other take their own lives. The boys were both 15 years old. Without going into a long story since I have not read it yet ( just bought it 15 minutes ago) would this book be something I could get for their mothers. I can not wait for my girls and I to read this book. Thank you Jesus!!.","date":"2012-02-06","mins":"11:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
