{"art":[{"author":"kristina","post":"I  heard about this on the News and just bought it on Amazon for my 2 daughters and I to read.  For all of you that have read it, my oldest daughter just had 2 of her friends within 2 days of each other take their own lives.  The boys were both 15 years old.  Without going into a long story since I have not read it yet ( just bought it 15 minutes ago) would this book be something I could get for their mothers.  I can not wait for my girls and I to read this book.  Thank you Jesus!!","date":"February 6, 2012 at 11:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
