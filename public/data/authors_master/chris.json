I do see a lot of the details that some people point out, for example, teeth in the mouth. However, I am not quite sure if those teeth are actually teeth that are partially revealed in some way through what I perceive to be closed lips or just noise from the shroud itself. I have a hunch they’re noise but am open minded. I also do clearly see the hand bones but I am not sure why – did Jesus have very little body fat and his bones shown through his hands like I’ve seen with some older folks? That seems plausible to a degree even without knowing the probable mechanism of image creation. The abnormally long fingers on the right hand seems to be a distortion caused be the tenting effect of the left leg being raised. But as for flowers, words and secret symbols I am of the mind that if they are not as plain, visible and discernable as the image of the man himself they are probably just noise.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory"},{"author":"chris","post":"Are there other scenes of a naked Christ in medieval art?

It’s a dying theory as it does not agree with the historical record, tradition, nor it’s own literary analysis. It is riddled with inconsistencies and flaws which cannot be easily explained and rely on itself for explanation. Scholars are starting to discard it and return the the Clementine tradition which predates the Jerome Tradition. \nThe conclusion is that Matthew wrote first almost immediately after the Resurrection followed by Luke. Peter probably had both scrolls in front of him as he preached in Rome and Mark transcribed Peter’s words verbatim (as the historical record indicates) thus explaining the poor Greek of Mark (Peter does not speak Greek very well since it is not his first language). So Mark is third as the historical evidence alludes. Q doesn’t exist as it’s understood and is probably actually just Matthew in Aramaic. John wrote last to combat heresy. \nA lot of scholars don’t accept this yet but the numbers who do are growing because suffice it to say that the overwhelming bulk of the evidence comes down in favor of the Clementine Tradition and the Church Fathers.\n\n","date":"February 15, 2012 at 9:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"chris","post":"Dave, thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. It’s a fascinating subject indeed. We’ll just agree to disagree. \nAs for Colin’s analysis, I think either way he’s making a mountain out of a mole hill. It’s just a detail that Peter remembers about someone running away. Peter spoke poor Greek and grasped at the word needed to describe the clothing, nothing more. Mark also was a Semitic and also spoke poor Greek so he just copied it down when Peter said it. The Gospels are chock full of miracles because these guys wanted you to believe Jesus was the real deal. If there was any hidden meaning via a foreshadowing of the supernatural behind the guy who ran away I think Peter would have said more. He inserts this detail memory and then goes back to reading Matthew’s account. Besides Jesus Himself does plenty of foreshadowing of His own death and Resurrection no need for a cryptic detail like a man dressed in a burial shroud to convey some hidden meaning. Being dressed in a burial shroud doesn’t make sense, even in this context. \nHis audience is foreign to him but he picks a universally understood emotion, especially in the ancient world – abject fear, to convey the context of the situation. The other thing it highlights is that if they were so terrified then but are boldly preaching now there must be some real truth to what these guys are saying about the Risen Lord walking out of the tomb if they’re not afraid of the prospect of death by execution to tell folks about this story. On the whole of Peter’s account he is showing that from fear to no fear the story they are preaching is real.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2012 at 11:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"chris","post":"Easy Dave, there’s enough room for Matthew and Luke Priority theory.

In fact, if Jesus did not rise from the dead they would have had no impetus to do anything. To them He would have been just another well meaning guy who got executed by the jealous powers at that time. No proof, really, that anything He said about Eternal Life was true. Why bother to leave everything to spread the Word? Missionary work was an unbelievably harsh life let alone life threatening when a hostile audience was encountered.

It not only reflects the accuracy of the Gospels’ accounts but it also reflects the sinfulness that caused Christ’s suffering. Most importantly, it shows the length Jesus went to in His suffering to show us how much He loves us. \nLooking at the wounds inflicted upon Him I imagine what it must have felt like, the excruciating pain and humiliation. It is truly humbling to know that He who made the Heavens and the Earth was willing to go through this just to show us how much He loves us. It is also very disheartening to reflect on the cruelty and hate humanity is capable of when it refuses to embrace the uncomfortable truth. This is the meaning of Original Sin.\nAnother thing I like to reflect on is that our current state of knowledge tells us that the universe is not infinite (John Klotz may agree with this point), it will most definitely end at some point and everything we know and see will cease to exist. Therefore, even if man should unlock the biological secret to perpetual life without aging no one will live forever, they will merely put off the day of reckoning. Our position is truly temporal in this realm. Jesus rescues us from that with the demonstration of Eternal Life through the Resurrection but He gets us there by also demonstrating that our death is also temporal. The shroud is the document of His death, it’s current emptiness begets the Hope of His Resurrection and with it our own invitation to Eternal Life.\n\n","date":"April 3, 2012 at 10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/02/it-seems-appropriate-to-reflect-on-this-image-of-a-scourged-blood-crowned-nailed-through-the-wrists-and-feet-lifted-up-and-pierced-crucified-man/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"It seems appropriate to reflect on this image of a scourged, blood crowned, nailed through the wrists and feet, lifted up and pierced crucified man"},{"author":"chris","post":"It’s mine, Dave, but feel free to repeat it far and wide.

Part of me says Jesus would have a LOT of blood on him after the scourging and crucifixion but there doesn’t seem to be a corresponding amount of blood on the shroud as I would theorize there would be. In this sense I can agree with Zugibe but I am not a forensic expert in this regard and therefore don’t really know. But then there seems to be some blood left over from the crucifixion like the blood on the face, head and the arms. Part of me wonders if there was a quick wash with a wet cloth over most of the body along with a hasty wrapping in the shroud with the intent to finish the job on Sunday. The Gospels are not clear about when the spices were to be applied despite Max’s assertions. I tend to think what generally happened was Jesus had a hasty burial that was to be completed after the Sabbath on Sunday. I also wonder if that strip down the side of the shroud was used like John Jackson supposes which is to say it tied up the whole body or if in the case of a hasty burial where the ritual spices were to be used later it was used just to tie the arms in place to hold them down. It could then be easily untied and the burial ritual could be continued and completed fairly easy.\nOne thing I’m coming away from this discussion is that it’s definitely real blood on the shroud regardless of the color of it. It’s really just a matter of determining what mechanisms make for the color. \nTruthfully, I was never really swayed about the bright red color objection from skeptics because anecdotally I’ve had plenty of bandaids come off my own body and the blood has remained bright red even after days. Don’t know how valid that is but it struck me as more probable that the blood in the shroud is authentic even with the color of the blood being so bright.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2012 at 10:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly"},{"author":"chris","post":"Good observations! Yeah, I’m starting to think we’re closer to the truth than not. One thing I thought was a really interesting detail that Jackson pointed out in his video was the bloodstain off the right elbow and how it corresponded with the shroud being tucked under the arm during wrapping. Not a detail that speaks to forgery is it? But it certainly is indicative that the shroud was wrapped in some way instead of just loosely laid over the body. \nAlso, there not being any traces of spices seems to negate Max’s assumptions though I respect that it was probably the intended burial ritual. I don’t think they had time to execute it and it seems very involved. I would also think that there would be more capillary evidence on the shroud with the blood spanning out had it been soaked. The blood on the hair doesn’t really bother me as I think Jackson is right when he supposes that it was not really on the hair but on the sides of the face and the cloth came away before the image was made. If the strip was used only to tie the arms to keep them from spanning out during rigor mortis then someone may have smoothed the shroud over the head and it eventually moved away or collapsed due to not being tensioned or tied. Pure conjecture on my part, but it crossed my mind.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2012 at 1:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly"},{"author":"chris","post":"And who is speaking here?

If they did wouldn’t the image on the face be more distorted and far less focused because the cloth would necessarily need to be against the sides of the head for a lot of the image forming time?

It’s plain to see you’re not interested in actual scientific exchange otherwise you would have accepted to join the other scientists in their association when offered. You won’t go there and debate them, you’d rather stay here and beat laymen over the head with your knowledge of science. Make you feel good? Why don’t you pick on someone you’re own size, huh? You don’t because you probably know you’ll get run out of town on a rail and therefore won’t dare tread amongst minds as keen as you fancy you’re own.

The fact that you constantly talk with forked tongue about how easy it would be for a forger to have made the shroud and how all it’s observed characteristics are nothing to be in awe of but yet you refuse to undertake the effort to reproduce it speaks volumes about what you’re real intentions are here. It’s all so easy, just a bunch arts and crafts until you’re asked to get in the arena and reproduce it. The thought of actually having to turn something out which will then come under the withering scrutiny of other scientists probably gives you hives. You’d rather burn a few trinkets into a cloth, blithely declare it’s a fair demonstration and call it a day. Then comes the endless leaving, but not leaving and the carping about having to deal with us. But you can’t stay away.

But I also accept that we will never have “proof” because God requires an Act of Faith for most of us. I believe some folks are granted proof for whatever reason (i.e. the Apostles and those who saw the Risen Jesus ascend to Heaven, for them Faith is no longer required because they have seen and know). I also agree with the sentiment that Faith is not compulsory as it is quite clear from the Gospels that God will not abrogate our free will (demonstrated be Jesus instructing His Apostles to walk away from those that would not receive them and the Gospel). It is probably because of God’s respect for free will that He requires an act of Faith from most.\nRon’s point about discussion regarding the shroud is spot on. It is a very polarizing subject even among Christians. It challenges folks to the very core of their world view in many ways and people do not like that being touched at all. Most folks, I think, seek validation of their world view and the shroud poses a huge problem for a lot of people comfortable in their outlook, even Christians. This is exactly why you get so much activity on the part of those who hold the shroud is irrelevant or inconsequential. They *need* to believe it’s not real while those of us who have Faith don’t need it at all. If it were definitively shown to be a fake tomorrow it wouldn’t mean a hill of beans to Christianity and it’s tenets.

I have nothing materially to add because I am not read on the matter but I will offer one thought. \nI thought I read somewhere, and I thought it was in Rogers’ work, that the image on the shroud may not have been immediately visible because it was created through a function of accelerated aging of the carbohydrate coating on the linen. So both the linen and it’s coating started aging but the coating aged faster and produced the image in time.\nMaybe if it took some time for the image to show up the shroud was merely locked away somewhere and thought of as an old bloody burial sheet. It doesn’t really hold a place of prominence in the Gospels and really is just mentioned in passing when the Resurrection is discovered. I think folks would be most interested in the artifacts of the crucifixion itself. Prior to discovering an image on the shroud maybe it was taboo to show given its association to a dead body.\nPerhaps if the delayed image theory has any merit to it then it might explain the relation to the sudden change in art. Maybe someone finally opened up and looked at the shroud after a few centuries of being stored away and suddenly discovered the image.\nWeak I know, but it crossed my mind at one point.\n\n","date":"February 4, 2012 at 8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/04/calling-all-history-buffs-interesting-comments-from-yannick-clment/","cat":"history","title":"Calling all history buffs: Interesting comments from Yannick Clément"},{"author":"chris","post":"As Andy mentioned this is old news.

This was evident to me by the fact that in image area scrapings blood constituents were detected on the fibers while non image area scrapings did not show any blood constituents on the fibers. The mattress image in my understanding is not comparable to the shroud image because it does not have the same physical and chemical properties. \nWhat is also implied by what I read about the mattress image was that the person need not have been alive when the image on the mattress was formed. I found that interesting because Helmut does believe that a live body is what was needed to make the shroud image. I find the unsmeared state of blood stains on the shroud to be evidence against this as I believe Helmut held forth that Jesus’ crucifixion survival would have been uncovered rather quickly while preparing Him for burial. And at that point Jesus would have been secreted away for recovery. I would think that the shroud would look highly smeared would that have been the case and in that case that Jesus survived in the tomb for any length of time the shroud would have been soaked with far more blood than we see.

From the very little I’ve read on this today it’s not a reach for this to happen. There’s something that’s called an “SRY” gene (I think) that gets turned on inside one of the X genes and it acts as the Y chromosome and at the same time the X gene it’s implanted in is “turned off”. This makes the person with this disposition a full male. I gather the gist of it is that he got that way by a round about approach.\nWhat’s being alleged is that this has been confirmed with the blood evidence on the shroud. I find it very hard to accept though because there is almost nothing to back up the claim. That and the fact that other scientists have claimed that the  DNA on the shroud is too old and to fragmented to yield anything of worth make me very skeptical that any such information can be gleaned from the biological evidence left on the shroud.\nIf it can be published, interpreted and reviewed in an acceptable scientific manner then it might be something worth looking at but otherwise I don’t see any merit to the claim.

He had already suffered death and was resurrected at that point. There was absolutely no chance that he would have been stoned. Remember He remained for quite a while among them after His Resurrection. He had absolutely no fear of any repercussion at this point and if He instructed His Apostles to ordain women as well as men I think they would have done it.

Don’t you think there is a sign there ?\nAnd don’t forget that it was as much impossible to Jesus to “ordained” some women after his Resurrection as it was before he died because the time was still no good at all for this kind of drastic change that would never have been accepted by the Jewish people of that era !\nAnd I still wait for someone to challenge my main argument :  IT IS A FACT THAT SOME WOMEN HAVE RECEIVED A CALL FOR PRIESTHOOD JUST LIKE MEN !!!  Don’t you think this is another great sign of the Holy Spirit ?  If God really wanted to keep women out of priesthood, don’t you think it would be logical to expect that no women would get a call from him ???  But that’s NOT the reality.  The truth is the opposite.  There really are some Catholic women who are called for priesthood !  And I don’t see one good reason to reject their call…\n\nYannick, Yes, I understand all that but my point is that the argument that He feared stoning is exceedingly weak. The same Jesus that was bold enough to tell the priests of the time that whores will enter the Kingdom of Heaven before them, tell them that they are a brood of vipers, smash their monopoly in the Temple market place by physically over-turning the tables and avoid, at Will, their attempts to arrest Him before the appointed time is not likely to be suddenly timid on the subject of ordaining women. Also, Jesus didn’t hesitate to raise the status of women to that of men when he told the priests and men of the time that they could no longer divorce women at will like a piece of mere chattel. \nI am not arguing either way only pointing out that the arguments being employed are untenable. Better arguments must be pursued. \nI find it also rather contradictory the attitude that it is ambiguous that Jesus actually ordained anyone versus the conviction that female ordination is absolutely what Jesus would desire. Again not arguing either way it’s just untenable to hold both views at the same time. Of course, if one held the view that no one is “ordained” only “called to serve” and that there is nothing conferred with Holy Orders/ordination it might be more consistent in some ways but it also begs the question of why should anyone care about ordination at all? Why even bother to expend any effort on this issue at all? Folks can just go and do what they feel is in their hearts (and many have) and ignore the hierarchy of the Church.\nMy suggestion is that a strong legitimizing argument is only going to be found in the Traditions of the Communities in the early Church. More research may need to be done in order to establish this. Everything else is speculation and projection and more importantly will not win converts.\nMore importantly, this attitude amongst some Christians, with regards to this issue, of ‘I am right, you are wrong’, ‘it’s my way or the highway’, ‘you’re not evolved’ etc etc etc is not productive in fostering relationships among us. No one is willing to entertain “what if my point of view is actually wrong on this issue?” That’s a problem for both sides. \nIs it not more important that we, above all, love one another even in the faults we see in one another? Yes, to me, it’s more important to learn to love like Him because it is in learning to love like that in this life, which is incredibly short in the vastness of eternity, which connects us to the Divine Love of the Risen Christ which in turn rescues us from our temporal condition. Beating each other up over political issues like this cannot get us closer to that and therefore cannot get us closer to Him.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2012 at 11:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion"},{"author":"chris","post":"Dave, you are illustrating the very thing I am pointing out in my post: both sides are very passionate about this issue and seemingly it is a huge political stumbling block to healing relationships among Christians of all stripes.

The big bloodstain (on the instep?) at the end of the ventral legs then appears more or less in the middle of the big footprint at the end of the dorsal legs. If we make a fold in the dorsal image, then either the ‘back of head’ bloodstains end up match up with the moustache, or the ‘instep’ stain now ends up matching the ‘toes’ end of the ‘footprint.’ Lesser distortion but at both ends simultaneously is also possible.\nIf the man on the shroud had bent legs, then, of course, the front image (the cloth following his contours) should end up significantly longer than the dorsal image (the cloth being flat), but in that case it is difficult to explain how the back of his calves could have left a mark.\nSorry, Chris, I was dragging in various comments from earlier postings for my comment about Dan’s iPad photo.\n(a) comes from the Gilberts’ spectroscopy paper which has a diagram of the reflectance spectrum of exactly this bloodstain.\n(b) comes from Miller and Pellicori’s UV paper which has a photograph of this bloodstain under UV light with no fluorescent serum rim.\n(c) and (d) are apparent just by looking at Dan’s posting.\nI dare say I often appear a bit round the bend anyway, but my observations are nearly always based on reports of primary observations.

In the end the actual date isn’t all that relevant. What the writers were trying to convey – mainly that they saw a man who proclaims to be “The Way, The Truth and The Life” suffer death and then rise from the dead. Jesus is the real deal, not some charlatan looking to get a following. Their primary purpose was to write down what was being passed on via oral tradition in the first few years after the resurrection and ascension. They needed to combat inaccuracies and set the record straight in their growing community.\nI will depart with Yannick and others here though: Matthew the apostle almost assuredly wrote his own gospel and he is an eye witness to the events. Mark copies Matthew and Luke not the other way around. And John wrote his gospel many years after the events so some details are probably not accurate with regards to peripheral facts but his recounting of Jesus’s words are probably very accurate given his age at the time of his following of Jesus. All the gospels were written before the revolt. It looks like the majority of you would probably disagree with this interpretation and I respect that but this is the perspective that I come from though.\n\n","date":"May 30, 2012 at 1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/26/quake-reveals-day-of-jesus-crucifixion-or-something-like-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quake Reveals Day of Jesus’ Crucifixion (or something like that)"},{"author":"chris","post":"The hands fascinate me as well, especially that right hand with the elongated fingers. That index finger is very intriguing and I have often wondered what it is that we are seeing. Was Christ’s fingers dislocated from perhaps someone pulling on them to get his arms spread more easily?\nThat right hand is also under what I assume to be a draping effect from the raised left knee. Does this cause some sort of distortion? All the fingers of the right hand look as if they are sort of sweeping . I also wonder if there is a double exposure effect from the shroud loosening as Max asserts. Whatever it is I see it as evidence that is stronger for the argument of authenticity than for forgery. I don’t think it likely that a forger would get everything else with regards to the pathology of crucifixion and then completely get the right hand wrong.\nAs for bones, I am fairly certain I see bones in the palm of the hand. This is the back of the left hand. Of course, Christ just may have been very skinny (which looks to be consistent with the rest of the body to my eye as I don’t see any indication of fat let alone excess fat). I have seen the hand bones of folks who are just as skinny so I don’t think it unusual that I should see bones on the back of the palm.\nAlso, for where the nail wound comes out of the back of the palm – when I use the shroudscope tool to analyze the length from where I think the fingers meet the hand (this is the space between the middle finger and the ring finger – the point at which they meet) to where I think the nail hole is I get a different measurement depending on which image I look at. The negative image seems to yield a smaller measurement while the normal photograph yields a measurement more consistent with the back of my own thumb (meaning it’s entirely consistent with driving the nail straight through the hand at the base of the thumb).\nThe left hand looks entirely normal to me otherwise.\n\n","date":"June 10, 2013 at 1:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/05/r-i-p-ben-wiech/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"R.I.P.

But instead we get science by press release with no context and the complete conjecture that it has any bearing whatsoever on the Christ story and therefore the role of women in the Church.

Rogers proved that beyond a shadow of a doubt.  According to all the medical experts that have studied the Shroud, the man enshrouded was without doubt dead.  There is absolutely no chance of that person surviving.\n\nWhat’s interesting about the hypothesis that Jesus survived the crucifixion is that it necessarily requires a naturalistic image formation. The problem proponents of this “live body” theory immediately run into is that the image on the shroud does not show the tell-tale signs that the man wrapped in it was alive. If he were alive there would be MUCH more image distortion, most especially in the areas of the face because he would be breathing. If a naturalistic image formation process was the cause of the image then you would most definitely see evidence of breathing interfering with that because the exhaust from the man’s lungs would disrupt the mechanism of image formation, especially around the nose and mouth. Plus there’s no image evidence of movement of ANY kind over it’s formation period, which would necessarily be many days. The man would have to remain dead still for the entire period.\nAlso, the blood evidence that remains would negate a live body as the man in the shroud would continue to bleed, especially from the side wound. There’s not enough blood on the shroud to suggest this was even possible, even at rates of flow where the victim was in a coma. And lastly, though not comprehensively, there’s no evidence of smearing of blood from the removal of the body. Had he been alive and got up of His own physical power (or even with the aid of another), even after days, it would be most plausible that there would be massive smearing of blood evidence because the wounds would still be bleeding, especially if the body was moved because it would disturb any clots, especially in the head, wrist, and side wound areas. There’s just no trace of this anywhere on the shroud. Even if anyone intended to fool future generations by carefully removing the shroud I do not think it could be done. But then again, who would intend to do such a thing in the first century. \nThe body wrapped in the shroud was dead.\n\n","date":"July 12, 2012 at 8:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/06/dawkins-challenge-noticed-by-ahmadi-muslim-researchers/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Dawkins Challenge Noticed by Ahmadi Muslim Researchers"},{"author":"chris","post":"It gave me a good chuckle when I read it.

They are not as dark in some places (like the hair) but until we completely understand the image formation mechanism we cannot say for sure why there’s not a uniform variance. But I do see that variance.\nThere is also a band that begins directly above the right eye and travels upward where it seems to terminate in the crown of thorns area.\nWho knows how large the hanks of linen yarn were?

I think it’s most pronounced in the face area because we as humans tend to focus on that feature and of course, everyone wants to see the face of God clearly. \nBut again this is all just theory and I am open to other interpretations and definitely believe that more research is needed to help further develop answers to these questions.

When I saw the illustrations of the nails through the thumb base I immediately thought it was like hanging a picture. When I drive a nail into a stud in the wall to hang a picture I drive it down at an angle. To me this mitigates issues with the nail coming out of the wall or bending etc. It struck me as reasonable that an executioner practiced in crucifixions may also employ this technique. Is it true that in most crucifixions the victim hung for days before expiring? If that was the common outcome then nailing a victim for the long term might lead an executioner to employ such a technique. \nAs for stigmatas on saints I would not be surprised to find them in areas that the saint perceived to be actual wound sites on Jesus. I don’t think it matters either. If stigmatas are genuine I would find it plausible that God would be working within the person’s perceptions of where the wound sites are. I would think an attribute (exact location) of the wounds is subordinate to the point God was trying to make through displaying them (I suffered at the hands of men, these agonizing wounds until death, to show you how much I love you). It is only through modern science can we more accurately fathom such agony by knowing all the aspects affected. \nOne thing that seems very clear to me is that this subject raises that issue that it would be highly unlikely for a forger to deliberately place the nail marks through the wrist as it would contradict the perception of most of the faithful observers. If the point of a “fake” shroud was to pull in money it would seem to be counter productive wouldn’t it? Doesn’t the controversy within the Church at the time reflect a bit of this? (a 14c Bishop claiming it to be a forgery and  to know the forger etc?)

Half the thread dated to 1200 AD and the other half to 200 AD. It says that Rossman personally confirmed this in a personal conversation with the author. It does not mention margins of error though as far as I can tell. Given the protocol for testing samples during the 1988 official testing one has to wonder what the MOE would be for a single thread. It also doesn’t address any potential contamination of the half which dated to the 2nd century. I could imagine if this were really true why some folks would seriously be knocked over by the 1988 findings.\nThere is also another paper and this one is probably the original paper I read:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf\nIt mentions the above paper and adds that Rossman vigorously denies any such testing took place in 1982 and even states that the equipment was not available at the time.

I’ve come to see the bible as a collection of testaments or testimonials from people and/or their chroniclers of how they had direct interaction with the living God. I come to regard those testimonials as highly reflective of each person’s expectations of God and what He represents to them at that time. Even though these testimonials are inspired by the Holy Ghost they are not dictated by Him. He will not abrogate our free will and that includes our core expressiveness. The Old Testament came from a time of survival and nation forging. Imagine the chaos of those times and all the abhorrent behavior that was rampant throughout human living conditions. Obedience in such times seems more valuable to a lawgiver than understanding and so the perspective of those who wrote many of books of the Old Testament was of a God who required obedience. They expected Him to impose order through obedience. And Faith undergirds obedience, like from the womb a child has Faith in it’s parents to take care of it. Where understanding is not possible, Faith bridges the gap.\nIt seems to me God works within the human condition, knowing us better than we know ourselves. God would probably have not gotten anyone to follow His Will had he not worked within the human expectation that a society must be made obedient first before it can be made to understand the basis of that obedience (simply because man is ignorant of his own nature). The New Testament represents the next and eternal phase – understanding. We have Christ’s positive affirmation of the law and Heaven. He encourages us to understand the law through his explanations of it, He gives us it’s meaning. \nNow step back a moment and look at the overarching narrative of the Old and New Testaments. They are indelible marks on history and enormously unforgettable events. God works, I think, in broad undeniable strokes and recurrent themes. What’s the best way to get your message across not only now but through all history? Make a broad undeniable movement within history; it’s got to be big enough that people will remember it for all time. Think of the indelible mark the Exodus has left on the Israelites. Think of the indelible mark that Jesus’ Resurrection made on all human history. The Resurrection itself is extremely extraordinary and represents the ultimate mark of His benevolence and message. It’s pretty darn hard to ignore someone who gets up out of His own tomb under His own power. Nothing less than this will make men turn their attention away from themselves and provide a basis for conversion throughout human history. What is also unique about the whole narrative is that Christ doesn’t conquer or vanquish those who put Him to death, on the contrary He saves them from death itself. He demonstrates through His Resurrection what He meant when He said God is a God of the living not the dead. Anyone that has the power to raise His own body after death certainly has the power to raise anyone from the dead.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 11:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/01/burden-of-proof-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"Burden of Proof on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"chris","post":"Yeah, I saw this the other day.

My intention is not to be offensive but clarify a few things that pop into my head whenever I see this argument about Jesus surviving the crucifixion (moderator please delete this if you feel it’s too strong or offensive, thanks in advance):\nIf Jesus survived the crucifixion wouldn’t the shroud be literally soaked with blood (especially in the back image area) as opposed to just stained with blood in places (assuming it’s His)? If a living body made the image where’s the example of a remake? Can anyone point to a shroud image with the same properties made with a living body? Why are all these other folks who are trying to show how the shroud was faked not even seeming to explore the option to create a fake with a living body? It would seem far easier to pursue that path than taking great pains to paint linens, wash them, heat them etc etc, right? Why not just create the live human version? Or would it require the nearly impossible hurdle of actually beating the living daylights out of someone, crucifying them and lancing them or do bodies make these kinds of images by some other means? If you have to put someone through that suffering to test the result (or multiple individuals to be repeatable) I’m guessing you’re not going to get too many volunteers therefore it’s not really all that testable. \nWhere does one get the (implied) notion that the Vatican has kept a conspiracy alive for 2000 years? – that they knew that Jesus was alive and therefore would have been depicted as such on the shroud when it came time to carbon date the shroud. What’s the point of even contemplating carbon dating the shroud if you already know that it probably disproves resurrection and you want to cover up that fact because it ruins your whole business model? Was anyone even contemplating that the shroud showed a live man at the time? If so, was that viewpoint so prevalent that the church believed it too and felt the overriding need to publicly discredit the shroud in an elaborate plan? Why bother? If someone was aware of a conspiracy all these years wouldn’t it have made sense to accidentally let the shroud burn up in the 1532 fire or subsequently get the idea that, hey here’s a good way to get rid of the evidence maybe we need to have another accidental fire?\nDo you think that the Vatican didn’t have a conspiracy and only came to realize in the 20th century that the man on the shroud was supposedly alive? If that’s the case: as a Pope or a Bishop how do you make such a sure determination that he was alive in the face of all the differing opinions regarding the living status of the man on the shroud and then take the path of covering it up? Was someone just covering all their bases? Why bother with testing the shroud in any kind of way at all if you’ve realized this before the tests were conducted? It’s not like they have to let it be tested, it’s the private property of the church and they can do whatever they want with it. \nWouldn’t the church be taking an awfully big risk, once deciding to carbon date the shroud even after determining that Jesus is depicted as alive in the image, of offering a contaminated sample that supposedly includes an invisible reweave from another century as well as original shroud material? Wouldn’t they run the risk of someone eventually discovering this? Wouldn’t it be a gamble as to what century would be returned by the carbon dating? Or was it only important that a non-first century date be returned? What do you think they might have said if a 17th or 18th century date was returned?\n\n","date":"January 11, 2012 at 4:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/09/new-kindles-from-helmut-felzmann/","cat":"books","title":"New Kindles from Helmut Felzmann"},{"author":"chris","post":"I think this is just being used as vehicle to express veiled hate.\n\n","date":"December 10, 2012 at 1:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/05/so-we-are-fruitcakes-just-in-time-for-christmas/","cat":"books","title":"So we are fruitcakes, just in time for Christmas"},{"author":"chris","post":"I think the concept is very interesting, I also think it may be irrelevant. A God that requires an Act of Faith for Salvation will not leave you any purchase on proof in this world which is not His Kingdom. Quantum mechanics will not show you anything of meaning and they will not show you the fingerprints of the Almighty. As an Act of Faith I accept that I will never have proof unless Christ reveals himself to me in an extraordinary form.  One thing that remains a very open question is whether we can know the cause of our existence through science. At present many minds don’t think that may be possible. I am open but not hopeful that the question will ever be settled in my lifetime. Whatever caused the Universe, or our state of being is not necessarily subject to it’s constraints. Time itself, from a quantum point of view probably did not exist prior to this Universe coming into being. It is an intrinsic characteristic to this Universe and therefore may not have existed at all prior to it. From that we can surmise that the cause of the Universe’s coming into being need not necessarily be constrained by Time  . . . or any other characteristic of this state of being. How does one measure or come to know and understand something that is not necessarily subject to anything we can possibly learn from this state of being? We may never be able to know scientifically anything outside our own Universe if that’s the case. It may all end up in the realm of philosophical conjecture.\nRegarding the Shroud I don’t think it shows any evidence of Resurrection. I am a firm believer that God doesn’t break the laws of nature, the laws of nature obey Him. I am faithful that one day one or more viable hypotheses will be developed which will show how, through natural events, the image on the Shroud was created. The only thing we can surmise is that something interrupted the Shroud’s interaction with a dead body. It may be the Resurrection, it may be someone stole the body or some other unforeseen explanation.

Interesting theories and definitely stuff worth pondering. \nOne of the things I wonder about though is how can we determine tight wrap versus a loose draping. Some of the blood stains suggest a tight wrap (or even a close wrap) without anything else in there – take that elbow bloodstain for instance. I recall reading something recently from another post where that blood stain maps to the man’s elbow if the shroud was wrapped around him. One would have to assume that there would not be anything else in there. The other thing is the bloodstains in the hair. Seemingly they map to the sides of the face? It would suggest, if that were true, that the shroud had to be wrapped tight at some point but then loosened and draped loosely for the image formation process. \nOne possibility is that Joseph had helpers and they were the ones who had to physically take the body into the tomb and lay it in the shroud. Maybe they were doing this while Joseph was getting other burial supplies to put in the tomb in anticipation of a later, fuller burial. Perhaps they weren’t all that familiar with what Joseph had in mind given the time constraints and so while waiting for him to arrive wrapped the body rather closely thinking they were helping and that Joseph would just carry in the burial stuff and lay it next to the body (on the floor or something) instead of placing it around the body. Joseph then comes in with the stuff and wants to give Jesus a modicum of respect with regards to burial ritual but doesn’t have time to do anything other than just lay the stuff closely against the sides of his body and drape the shroud over everything. After all he’ll be back after the Sabbath to finish the job. And having those spices there might help with the inevitable stench from the decaying corpse.  I can’t imagine that would take all that long and it might be long enough to allow the blood transfer to happen and then the image formation could happen over the period of the next 48 or so hours. \nPure speculation on my part but in any scenario I think for a naturalistic process theory to work you’ve got to have both a tight wrapping and a loose draping if those facial and elbow bloodstain mappings are correct.\n\n","date":"June 17, 2014 at 1:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/16/clarification-of-the-stochastic-process-paper/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Clarification of the Stochastic Process Paper"},{"author":"chris","post":"Hugh, yeah, it’s tough to explain.
