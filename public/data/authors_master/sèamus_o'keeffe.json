{"dating":[{"author":"sèamus_o'keeffe","post":"I have found many links to information regarding the shroud, but I could not find one for my question. The Gospel of John states the following:20:4 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.20:5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.20:6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,20:7 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.20:8 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.Obviously John describes the linen clothes in more detail than the other Gospel writers, however, this would seem to denote that the piece of cloth wrapped around the head was completely seperate from the other burial clothes.  Can someone please help me with this? Any thoughts? (Feel free to comment here, I will check back, or email semanticconduit@gmail.com) Thank you.","date":"June 5, 2009 at 12:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/03/12/shroud-of-turin-opinion/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Shroud of Turin Opinion"}]}
