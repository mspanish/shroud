And when He had thus spoken, He showed them His hands and His feet.” Luke 24:39 40. Sampath, you will not be able to explain many things about God. They are far deeper than our small minds can comprehend. It is clear Jesus was referring to His material body. It was transformed (metamorpho).

What were some of the Jesus Seminar’s conclusions? According to the seminar, “Jesus was a mortal man, born of two human parents who DID NOT perform nature miracles, NOR die as a substitute for sinners NOR rise bodily from the dead. Sightings of a risen Jesus were NOTHING MORE than the visionary experiences of some of his disciples rather than physical encounters” (Jesus Seminar Wikipedia). Crossan and those of his kind are nothing more than ‘heretics’ who dismiss the historicity of the Bible and the veracity of Scripture. Serious Biblical scholars (and Sindonologists), should not waste their time debating historical revisionists who make outlandish, nonsensical claims and are purveyors in sensationalism!.","date":"2015-01-07","mins":"11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/07/we-also-have-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin"}],"image":[{"id":"comment-206025","author":"david_o","post":"Those of us in St. Louis for the Shroud conference last October remember the standing ovation Robert A.

Steering completely AWAY from what the Shroud shows us, we are taken on a visual journey of Jesus carrying the complete cross which, by their own admission, would have weighed 300lbs. It would have been impossible to carry. Especially someone as brutalized as the Man in this cloth. We KNOW the Shroud depicts the shoulder wounds to have been made by the patibulum (cross beam). This would have been tied upon the Man using ropes. More surprising was when they contradicted this obvious (intentional?) error, by then inexplicably soliciting John Jackson’s obviously correct interpretation for the shoulder wounds. How could this blatant Shroud falsehood have been included in the final cut for Finding Jesus? During those scenes of Him carrying His cross on the Via Dolorosa, I almost expected to see Veronica coming out from among the crowd to wipe the face of Jesus. Sincere, legitimate, objective efforts must used when giving the public Shroud information. Every attempt should be made to ensure that misrepresentation (willful?) of what is already known to be fact is eliminated. The mistreatment of the shoulder wounds was glaring!.","date":"2015-03-02","mins":"10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/01/open-discussion-about-episode-one-examining-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"television","title":"Open Discussion About Finding Jesus, Episode One: Examining the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-174641","author":"david_o","post":"Russ…….I agree with Mike M.
