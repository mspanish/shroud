{"art":[{"author":"patrick_sheehan","post":"Very interesting theories, Paul.  The questions of relative dimensions of shroud image and Cornellian’s relief first came to mind, given that you truthfully assert you have only made these discoveries via photographic evidence.  Your honesty is commendable but a hurdle that cannot be over come without further work on your part.  \nAdditionally, I have to wonder why cracks, chips, and broken fingers would be present on a brand new sarcophagus?  It seems your assertion is in fact that the Shroud we see today and was first displayed by canons of Lirey in 1357 was made through a bas relief technique of unknown description based off of the brand new sarcophagus of de Corneillan just a year earlier.   Unless the sarcophagus was heavily damaged in the first year of existence, some of your points (hands and 30 degree rotations) seem highly dubious.\n\n","date":"February 21, 2015 at 6:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/21/a-bas-relief-match-to-the-shroud-of-turin-image/","cat":"art","title":"A Bas Relief Match to the Shroud of Turin Image?"}]}
