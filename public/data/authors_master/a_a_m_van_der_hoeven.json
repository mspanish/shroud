On the early morning of Easter John Mark “saw and believed” (John 20,8); he saw his tallit in the empty grave, “rolled up in one place” (John 20,7), just as a priest’s temple garment was always rolled up and put in one particular place in the temple, namely at the head of the sleeping priest, and believed that only a risen Jesus could have done this for him. He took it form the grave – Jerome says that Jesus gave it to the servant of the priest (De Viris Illustribus II) , removed the corners and its fringes, to prevent that anyone would recognize the rolled up cloth as his unique tallit, hid it and remained a priest and secret disciple, just as Jesus had commanded him – “remain until I come” (John 21,22) , and later took it to Ephesus with Mary. If you wish, read the arguments and details from Bible and Talmud and Shroud research in my free biblical article “The seam and missing corners of the Turin Shroud as characteristics of John Mark’s temple garment” on my site http://www.Jesus King.info, or else my more elaborate free article, which contains the same thesis, “John Mark – Author of the Gospel of John with Jesus’ mother”. The articles are also available and free in Dutch. I am sorry I didn’t know about Mr. John N. Lupia’s book, or about this site, until today.
