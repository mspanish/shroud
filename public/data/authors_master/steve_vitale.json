{"resources":[{"author":"steve_vitale","post":"Well this has certainly been ridiculously more frustrating than I had bargained for.  I applied the date filter in YouTube to a Shroud of Turin search and there’s nothing older than 5 years.  The second time I saw the Part 2 show I mentioned was probably early 2000’s.  The carbon dating was done in 1988, so the two shows were probably produced in the 90’s.\nAlso, I said the show MAYBE PBS.  I searched on the PBS, Discovery, History Channel, KCET, websites and there’s nothing related to the shroud.  It’s not surprising they don’t have programing archives going back over 10 years.\nSo I guess I’m SOL.  I saw the show twice and I know what I heard.  Believe want you want.  The only other interesting tidbit I remember (but not really relevant to the results) is, the Arizona lab scientist interviewed on the show included a side story of a colleague (and shroud tester) who was adamant about the shroud being a fraud.  He’s the guy I mentioned that said they had scanned the shroud and didn’t see repair fabric, so he questioned that theory.  While they were studying their last testable shroud swatch and eventually testing it, the colleague contracted cancer.  He died after the testing was completed, but before he did, he made a plea to the interviewed scientist to make sure the new test results were made public and the truth be known (which admitted they had made errors in the original tests).   A bit of drama, I know, but an interesting side note.\n\n","date":"March 4, 2015 at 12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/13/two-more-articles-about-upcoming-cnn-series-on-finding-jesus/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Two More Articles About Upcoming CNN Series on Finding Jesus"},{"author":"steve_vitale","post":"What I said in my post is from the 2 shows I mentioned, not my assumptions.  As I stated, one of the original scientists from Arizona was interviewed.  He told the story that I summarized: that after they reviewed the “error paper” I mentioned above, their lab found the repair fabrics weaved into the last sample they had.  When they separated the fabrics, the older swatch tested to the 1st century (and I think he also indicated the newer fabric was from the 16th century, but I can’t remember for sure).\nThat same scientist indicated the original results were “averaged” and commented that individually the differences were beyond acceptable tolerances.  He went on to say that should have alerted them to a problem, but they ignored it.  This might help, a report of the carbon dating results.  http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm \nIf you look toward the bottom, Table 3, the date ranges are all over the map.\nAlso, note the 2 other contributors, including the British Museum’s Research Laboratory.  And of the testing labs, the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and History of Art, University of Oxford.  Given what was at stake, it seems highly unlikely the Vatican would have given samples of a priceless relic to anything but reputable laboratories, so your comment about peer review, questioning the lab results, is not really valid.\nAs you can see, what you believed to be assumptions, were not assumptions on my part, they were reported by one of the original testing scientists from the Arizona lab.\n\n","date":"March 3, 2015 at 11:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/13/two-more-articles-about-upcoming-cnn-series-on-finding-jesus/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Two More Articles About Upcoming CNN Series on Finding Jesus"},{"author":"steve_vitale","post":"The Shroud of Turin show on CNN is irresponsible journalism and bad science.
