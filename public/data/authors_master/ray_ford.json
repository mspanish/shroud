{"misc":[{"id":"comment-194188","author":"ray_ford","post":"Many theorist are putting too much into how the shroud was created. Take God and religion out of the theories and consider that basically the story of a man named Jesus is at least partly true. Jesus was accumulating a large following and telling them that there was another way for a person to have their sins cleansed so they didn’t have to pay to use the temple baths to have their sins cleansed. The temple priests could see that he was cutting into their money so they decided to get rid of him. First they had him arrested by the Romans and the Romans beat him with a flagrum but the priest still weren’t rid of him so they demanded that he be crucified so the provost marshal, Pilate, relented. So Jesus had to carry his own crossbeam through the streets falling down several times until someone carried the crossbeam for him. The Romans nailed him through the wrists and ankles to the cross so he was secure. As Jesus stayed on the cross his lungs began to fill with fluids until he passed out. With the Passover festival beginning the next day no one wanted these people or their bodies on public display so the Roman soldier thrust a spear into them. This could have possibly saved Jesus’s life by doing a crude surgical procedure that drained the water out of one of his lungs, creating a sucking chest wound. By this time his breathing would have been so shallow it would be hard to tell weather he was alive or dead. Either way he was taken down for a hasty tomb burial. A wealthy follower provided a high quality burial shroud. So. Jesus was quickly covered with oil without first being washed and put in a tomb. My theory is that the image on the shroud is genuinely Jesus and caused by stains from the blood, dirt, sweat, and oil, nothing more. The oil would have the dried blood, dirt and salt from sweat dissolved into it and this would have caused some serious stains on the surface of the shroud. How simple is that?.","date":"2015-03-23","mins":"5:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/media-release-vision-tvs-conspiracy-show/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","title":"Media Release:  Vision TV’s Conspiracy Show"}]}
