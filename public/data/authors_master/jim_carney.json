That desire to be God is the original sin of mankind and it keeps cropping up in various ways. Some of my friends like the notion of being part of God because it eliminates any fear of permanent separation from God; i.e., hell. Jesus’ teachings on this subject are quite clear: sin separates us from God and serious sin includes the risk of permanent separation in the afterlife. Hindu and other Eastern religions do not inform our Christian truths although their effects on human behavior are worth studying and perhaps emulating in some aspects. In considering the meaning of Christ’s various pronouncements it is important to remember that he was speaking on two levels: one, to his Jewish contemporaries who all expected the Messiah to establish a new kingdom and political entity on earth in cooperation with the Jews, his “chosen people.” Noting that “the kingdom of God is within you” was telling them that he was not here to establish an external kingdom to expel the Romans and make Israel the dominant nation of earth. This message was slow to take root among the apostles who seemed to be in a state of constant befuddlement as to who Jesus was and what his teachings were all about despite their enthusiasm for his miracles. They were still asking about Israel’s return to power when Jesus ascended to heaven following his crucifixion and resurrection! Jesus’ words, of course, have a second level of meaning intended for all of us down through the ages. In this context, the “kingdom of God is within you” refers both to our spiritual natures (souls) and the fact that our relationship with Him is primarily internal; i.e., it is the quality of our “hearts” rather than the keenness of our minds or the prowess of our bodies that determines whether we are in harmony with God and, therefore, happy. This is not to say that external actions and events do not matter because those are the manifestation of what is in human hearts as well as opportunities to put our good hearts to work in furthering the love of God for humanity. Louis calls the quotation “complex.” I would not use that word since I think the concept is not complex. However, there are folds of meaning in the context of both world and heaven that bear a great deal of analysis and discussion so perhaps our difference is mostly semantic..","date":"2015-09-07","mins":"1:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

We know from the New Testament that the burial “team” was under a lot of time pressure to get Jesus into the tomb before the sabbath began. It is entirely plausible that the washing was hasty, superficial and incomplete. As for dirt on Jesus’ face, this is the first time I have heard of that. Dirt on the bottoms of the feet, okay.

Beyond that, what kind of morons would the apostles and early Christians have to have been to see this inexplicable event (hypothesizing for the moment that it could have happened), then conflate two separate lives, make up a series of miraculous deeds that Jesus performed, abandon their previous livelihoods and spread a story that no one would believe (because no one would have heard word one about miracles that didn’t take place) in order to get themselves martyred in brutal deaths for a heavenly reward by a figure they had just made up?

If the shroud wrapped a crucified man at the time of Jesus, it is astronomically certain to have been Jesus himself. And if so, then it means that God arranged for this photographic miracle to document Jesus’ resurrection. If God did it, then he can do whatever he wants, including suspending the ordinary laws of nature. In this sense, the Shroud of Turin is like the Tilma of Guadaloupe, a 500 year old image of the Blessed Virgin Mary on a flimsy cactus fiber cloak that should have disintegrated centuries ago. No one has been able to explain how that image was formed either, or what sustains the material upon which it appears. On the other hand, if the shroud is a medieval forgery, then it is incumbent upon those asserting such a position to demonstrate how this image with all its biological fluids was created at a time when photography was unknown, much less the properties of a photographic negative. So far, no one has come close to accomplishing this task so the vast majority of these Shroud of Turin comments, claims and observations just form a closed loop of irrelevance. No offense, Dan.

And while I am a lifelong and devout Catholic, I also understand that God is not the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church is not God. It wasn’t so long ago that Catholic education included not so veiled warnings that only Catholics could go to heaven. And there was a very strict list of “mortal” sins the commission of a single one of which would condemn one to a fiery eternity of suffering and remorse unless first confessed to a priest. So, now let’s think about this a bit. Who among us would torture someone with fire for even a little while for missing Mass, or masturbating, petty lying or cheating, or just having lust in our hearts? Yet we used to blithely teach that God would do just that. And who among us would condemn to hell a kindly and loving ex Catholic, even one who remarried, much less a homosexual person? Yet many so called “good Catholics” have said that God will do exactly that. No wonder poor George Carlin could not remain in the faith. The sad thing about these views is that it makes God much inferior to us in the loving department because as bad as we all are, no civilized person would condemn these individuals to cruel punishments of fire and torture. These are not the things that constitute evil. Evil comes from hate and anger, destructive impulses, greed and selfishness. God’s love for us is infinite and eternal and so vastly beyond our comprehension that we can only humbly say “thank you” and try to love Him and our fellow human beings better as we live out our lives. I feel sorry for so called “good Catholics” who drag out their rule books and solemn papal pronouncements and think that those in any way offer reliable judgments about God’s ways or those who try to do his will. So distorted did this approach to Christianity become that it wasn’t too long ago that dissenters were burned alive in the belief that this would meet with God’s approval. What a strange and horrible god that would be–more likely to be the one down yonder than the Creator and Redeemer. And if anyone chooses to take issue with this by quoting Christ’s warnings in the New Testament, there are ways to properly interpret those comments without turning God into a sadistic and vindictive tyrant. This is not the forum for that discussion. But suffice it to say that we will all be judged by whether we loved. Those who die with an unloving heart will not be able to be in the presence of Love Eternal. From that separation come all the agonies of hell. It is worth reviewing the NDE literature to get a far more accurate view of the nature of God and the afterlife. Just don’t get carried away with it. It is very reliable for helping us to understand that God loves all of us–and probably has no objection whatsoever to female priests–and welcomes all those with good hearts into His eternal kingdom regardless of their religious affiliation or even if they have any religious belief at all. The near death reports don’t tell us much, however, about our placement in that kingdom or whether there may be a process of “re education” needed based upon our failure to adequately serve God and love in this life. As for Tipler, consider this quote from Dan’s summation above: “It is with mankind’s technology that immortality will be achieved.” Now if I am certain about anything, it is that mankind will never achieve immortality on its own. It is a free gift from God made available to us through the redemption of Jesus. Good grief. Mankind has hardly done a good job with our one planet and its resources. If left to this species to save the universe, well, might as well plan to move to another one if the opportunity presents itself. As for the whole notion of multiverses themselves, I don’t know why this is deemed such a far out notion. We already know there are multiple dimensions in the universe–Jesus and his mother, Mary, have moved in and out of them on several occasions in history. How many are there? No one knows, of course, but it would make sense that there may be multiple dimensions for persons of different levels of holiness for those would logically determine proximity to God. And cosmology’s “string theory” with its core conclusion that everything in existence consists of vibrating energy, not to mention the strange relationships of quantum mechanics, seems to draw science and faith closer together than ever..","date":"2015-06-30","mins":"7:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"id":"comment-204257","author":"jim_carney","post":"Yes, thanks, daveb, for the reference to Michio Kaku.

Speaking emphatically and dogmatically does not convert a papal pronouncement into an ex cathedra pronouncement. The Church, in order words, commonly leaves room for dissent and modifications no matter how much it discourages it. Pope John Paul II stressed the overriding importance of conscience and the fact that every individual is free to follow his informed conscience in matters of faith and morals. Of course, one’s conscience may take one out of a particular religion’s category if there is rejection of key elements of that faith. The key elements of being a Catholic are listed in the Nicene Creed. I fully subscribe to all of those. I remain a Catholic in spite of many wrong headed pronouncements by the hierarchy because there I find Christ in the sacraments, especially the Eucharist, in the Word of God, and the communion of the faithful. I reject the notion that “membership” has anything whatsoever to do with salvation. Membership in the Catholic Church as well as other Christian denominations provides great advantages in pursuing a life that will result in salvation because we hear the teachings of Jesus and learn how we are to form our lives in conformance with those. But no one who shows up at the gates of heaven is going to be admitted solely upon showing their Catholic ID card. And many noncatholics are going to be (and have been and are now) joyfully admitted because they are loving human beings who desire to be in the presence of God. Almost every Catholic I know who is strict about following all the rules and quick to condemn “cafeteria Catholics” is judgmental and self righteous–usually accompanied, however, by a good measure of fear. Their path to God is filled with trepidation and warnings of how easy it is to go to hell and how difficult to get to heaven. What love they have for Christ and their fellow human beings is well hidden in their condemnations and angst. There is probably no other command expressed more frequently in the New Testament by Jesus than to not judge others. We cannot do it correctly and it is an offense to God to even try because judging souls is His job. My advice is to learn to see the forest for the trees. Jesus taught us that there are two great commandments which contain all the rest: love God with all our hearts, minds, souls and strength and our neighbor as ourselves. And the Apostle John reminded us that loving God means loving our neighbor. This is the way to heaven and it not only points to eternal joy with God but it also lights our paths here on earth with happiness and grace. Another guiding principle is to always remember that God is far more loving than you. If you can see the good in other people who do not share your religious faith (which you are required to do, by the way, by your Catholic faith as well), certainly God can see it far more clearly. If other people seem to revel in the presence of a good person who radiates caring and concern, you can be certain that God wants that person around also. As I mentioned before, the NDE literature gives us a very good picture of the nature of God. It is quite reassuring as I know that Jesus meant us to feel joyful and happy about his “Good News.” This, in fact, may be why we are hearing so much about near death experiences now–God is tired of the bad rap he’s been getting from people quite willing to speak for Him when they assert the likely eternal condemnation of those who do not share their particular religious beliefs. In short, stop worrying so much about being a good Catholic and concern yourself with being a good Christian. You’ll find they blend nicely when you do that and, suddenly, it won’t be so hard to recognize that gays and women are loving human beings, too, with all the capabilities and spiritual beauty of heterosexual men–including as religious leaders..","date":"2015-07-02","mins":"5:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"id":"comment-204525","author":"jim_carney","post":"Nabber’s link to the 10 facts Catholics should know because they define what it means to be Catholic took me right back to my pre Vatican II days. It’s no wonder that Church membership has declined so severely in the Western world and why so many young people are staying away. These authoritarian claims with their not so veiled threats of eternal damnation if one dares to question or deviate are far from inspiring. They induce little but fear and trepidation and suffocate the joy and inspiration that we should be finding in the teachings of Jesus and the revelation of God as our eternal Father who loves us beyond measure. Nabber’s request to be spared the “peace and love” between so called cafeteria Catholics and the rest says it all. If God and Jesus are not all about love and peace, then we’re all pretty much doomed. And, frankly, heaven is not all that appealing if it means being surrounded by people proclaiming their rules and comparing their sufferings and “tsk tsking” over the vast numbers of people who failed to fall into line during their lives on earth and now are roasting in the flames of hell as their just punishment. Fortunately, we have the testimony of countless near death experiencers who give us a far different picture of the afterlife with God. It’s clear from their testimony that when Jesus spoke of the two great commandments of loving God and our neighbor (fellow humans) he meant that to define the proper way to live. When he speaks in Matthew 25 about the Last Judgment’s review of how we treated the least of his people as the standard for life with God, or gives us the example of the Good Samaritan, a person whom the Jews (God’s chosen people by His own word) regarded as an offense to God because of the Samaritans’ failure to practice their religion as the Jews did, or tells us the parable of the Prodigal Son and his joyful reception by his father after years of dissolute living, we get a true picture of what God values. Nothing in the life of Jesus as we find it in the New Testament suggests that the love of God and the invitation to be with Him in heaven is limited to Catholics, especially when to be a so called “good Catholic” has little to do with the heart and everything to do with intellectual assent and compliance. Nabber also asserts that “Individuals by themselves cannot receive the Inspired word.” It is true that public revelation ended with the death of the last apostle (John) and that private revelation since then is never binding. But this in no way means that God does not communicate directly in extraordinary ways with many souls on earth. And God has sent Mary back to earth on many occasions to give us guidance and assistance. Each of us has a direct spiritual line to heaven through prayer and divine inspiration is often the result of that. It’s not binding on anyone else but it is reliable guidance for the person receiving it. You will find God in and through your heart. By your works and attitude thereafter you will know if you got the message. It’s all about peace, love, and the invitation of God to all peoples to share His life in heaven. It may be that the staunch and intolerant Catholics will have their own special Heaven–St. Paul himself referred to the “third heaven”–but those who seek God with a good heart will find Him both here and in the afterlife and eternal joy in His presence. No claims of infallibility by very fallible human beings, no matter how united, will make the Catholic Church the equivalent of Jesus and his Father themselves. A little humility in this sphere would go a long ways. Pope Francis has inspired millions of people worldwide, both Catholic and non Catholic, precisely because he seems to be all about universal love and much less about being Catholic with all the answers and a demand to adhere to his pronouncements whether they seem loving or not. The Church hierarchy would do well to follow his guidance and offer Catholicism as a sacramental refuge in this harsh world, a place where we can find Christ directly in the Eucharist and grow his love by helping and caring for one another in every way that we can. Bishop Curry spoke very eloquently and movingly of the Eucharist. Catholic priests and bishops would do well to emulate his example. We might start getting some more people interested in becoming Catholic. Now, Dan, we are indeed way, way off topic.

That is a popular theme among revisionist Christians (who really should find a new name for themselves) who like to assert such claims as that the miracle of the loaves and fishes was just the power of Jesus’ personality inducing the crowd to share what they had intended to keep for themselves. Presumably, the resurrection itself must be suspect if it is not possible that the Shroud was miraculously left behind as photographic evidence of Jesus’ reality, suffering and resurrection. On the other hand, of course, their opinion may simply be a kind of subconscious residue of a general discrediting of religion by science so that the only thing left to support religious beliefs is our “faith.” If so, some of them may turn out to be open to a persuasive presentation on the Shroud. It would also serve them well to read Dr. Frederick Zugibe’s book, “The Crucifixion of Jesus: a Forensic Inquiry” (2005). The one amusing thing in the group’s opinion is the belief that the Shroud cannot be real despite the carbon 14 dating when the results of that testing in 1988 purported to prove that the Shroud was, in fact, not a real artifact that wrapped the body of Jesus. Obviously, this group is woefully uninformed about multiple things.

I do not accept the Church’s teaching on artificial birth control and believe that using that position to oppose the huge extension of health care (“Obamacare”) for millions of people in America is a travesty. Talk about the “goats and the sheep.” They should read Matthew 25 every day until they realize the few things Jesus enumerates as specific criteria for our salvation include providing health care for our “neighbor.” You are free to follow your conscience. In fact, you pretty much have to do so. The Catholic Church believes that the Sacrament of the Eucharist is the true body and blood of Jesus. So do I. Because of this, some churches and priests get carried away with trying to make sure no one receives communion who is not a registered Catholic. Personally, I don’t think Jesus is upset when a person of faith receives the Eucharist. That is the relationship you have with him and you should follow your conscience on it. Of course, if you believe in the Eucharist as Catholics do, you might want to consider becoming a Catholic. But if you are “gay,” of course, and in a homosexual relationship, the Catholic Church excludes you from membership. Well, if homosexuality is your nature and not simply a choice, that is the way you are and I know that God loves you as much or more than me.

As for gays and the state of their souls, I do not believe that gays in a committed relationship are offensive to God even if they do engage in sexual activities. As Pope Francis recently said, who are we to judge? I ask two questions: (1) Where is the compassion for people who have the same desires as everyone else for a committed sexual relationship with another person but, because of a flaw in their nature, are attracted to persons of the same sex? (2) If people are genuinely homosexual by nature, why is it sinful for them to live like everyone else? We make accommodations for all kinds of disabilities and handicaps. Why not this one? I have been friends with many gay people in my lifetime. Most of them have been warm and caring human beings. I believe their lives have exemplified God’s call to love and service better than many heterosexual people I have known, even those who attend church regularly and regard themselves as upstanding Christians.

A few points: (1) Like any penal system, the Romans preferred deterrence over punishment. Having the stipes permanently mounted on Golgotha which was at the crossroads of two main roads converging on Jerusalem served this purpose well. This site was outside the walls of Jerusalem and out of sight of the Temple so the well known Jewish outrage at Temple sacrileges would have been substantially muted. Similarly, the route to Golgotha was chosen to maximize the public spectacle so as to add to the deterrent effect of this horrific form of execution. (2) Dragging a 100+ pound full cross would have been extremely difficult, perhaps impossible for someone as badly beaten and tortured as Jesus was. Further, it appears the size of the Roman execution detachment was four or five men, including a centurion on horseback. To ensure that a condemned prisoner did not simply dump his cross and take off through the crowds in the narrow streets suggests that the patibulum (crossbar) was laid across his back and tied to his arms. As for the marks on the shroud, it must be remembered that Simon the Cyrenean helped Jesus to carry his cross. It may be that by the time they reached Calvary Simon was carrying the whole thing. Once Simon began helping, the patibulum would have rested on only one of Jesus’ shoulders at a time. (3) If there is any “classic” authority on crucifixion to be read, it is not Barbet. His conclusions on the crucifixion itself have been largely rebutted by Dr. Frederick Zugibe in his books, “The Cross and the Shroud” (1988) and “The Crucifixion of Jesus” (2005). Specifically, the notion that the victim had to raise himself on the cross to breathe and eventually died of asphyxiation when he could no longer do that is false. I was dismayed to see eminent Shroud researcher John Jackson repeat this discredited notion in the CNN show. The simple fact is that there is no more impediment to breathing by a crucifixion victim than there is for any person standing up with his arms outstretched to the sides. Try it against a wall on your tiptoes if you want to get as close to the physical posture of a crucifixion victim as you can. Now substitute a nail for the floor and you’ve got it. The point is that with the nail you are still standing. Your skeletal structure is the same as when you stand on the floor. A lot more painful, of course! If you want to test the hypothesis even further, nail a pair of old shoes on a wall and put gate handles where your outstretched hands would be. Get someone to help you and put your feet in those shoes while holding the handles. You will discover there is no problem breathing. You will discover that there is little weight on your hands and arms. You will also discover that you really cannot raise yourself at all. Within seconds your thigh and shoulder muscles will begin cramping. The only way you can find some slight relief is to lean forward as far as you can. All of this is discussed by Zugibe who also discredit’s Barbet’s thesis for the hand nailing. (4) Finally, it is in the nature of human beings to find the easiest way to do things. The easiest way to nail a person to a cross is to assemble the cross first, then lay the victim on it, then drive the nails through hands and feet (with one or more other people holding the victim in place), then use ropes attached to each end of the patibulum to pull the cross upright while the end of the stipes is placed at the edge of the hole where it is normally kept.

There is nothing in Scripture to support a notion that a separate cloth was ever used to protect the modesty of the dead Jesus. Finally, John’s reference to the cloth covering Jesus’ face doesn’t mean that the cloth was a small, head sized one. Again, the common sense reading of the Gospels is that the long sheet used to wrap Jesus’ body (like the Shroud of Turin) was placed under and over the body then wrapped with pieces of linen cloth to hold the body intact. The spices were used to counter the odor of decomposition and were a sign of respect for the deceased. Like his argument for how medieval persons could have created the shroud by coating a man with flour and water (just wait 1000 years or more and you will see!), his reading of the plain words of the New Testament is just another tortured, convoluted bit of nonsense.

This seems about as ignorant as one can get. Besides the extensive details in the New Testament, several other secular historians, such as the Jewish Josephus and Roman Tacitus, mention Jesus. And how dumb is it to believe that a group of Jesus’ contemporaries (apostles, disciples) made the whole story up and then went out and spread it in the face of brutal mistreatment and cruel martyrdoms. Why would any group of people do such a thing? The whole notion is idiotic. It’s one thing to argue that Jesus wasn’t God as he claimed to be (though the evidence is powerful, indeed); another to say that he didn’t even exist. How can anyone take these people seriously?

That is pretty much the point Jesus was trying to make to the apostles, who were deathly afraid he was just a ghost, when he appeared to them in the upper room on Easter Sunday. See, for example, Luke 24:39 where Jesus says to the apostles: “Touch me and see that a ghost does not have flesh and bones as I do.” He then ate some fish to show them that his bodily functions were still physical. As for how the image on the Shroud of Turin was formed, if it is indeed the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, then the formation of the image is a miraculous event preserving a picture of Christ’s sufferings on the cross for the redemption of mankind. We need not speculate in this case on how the image was formed since it is, by definition, accomplished by means that we do not understand. Endless analysis and speculation about how the image might have been formed by natural means is of interest only if the image is not a divinely created one of Jesus in the period before his resurrection. In considering this basic question, however, it is relevant to discuss whether there is any possible natural explanation for how the image was formed and whether there is any evidence to establish its actual age. In my opinion, nothing that I have read offers any persuasive evidence that the Shroud is not the true burial cloth of Jesus. The least convincing of all arguments is that it could not be valid since we cannot figure out how the image might have been formed. In this sense, the Shroud of Turin is like the Tilma of Our Lady of Guadaloupe. This enduring image of the Blessed Virgin Mary on a cactus fiber cloak of a Mexican peasant nearly 500 years ago (1531) is inexplicable both for how the image was formed and how it is that this fragile garment has not fallen into dust centuries ago. And I refer you to my own book, The Seton Miracles: Weeping Statues and Other Wonders (1993, 94, 98) for a more contemporaneous account of seemingly natural occurrences that cannot be explained by natural causes innocent or otherwise.

Physicists are contemplating what this might mean in terms of multiple universes or the so called “M Brane” concept. Well, we already have a good notion of at least one dimension: the spiritual one that we call heaven or the afterlife. Since it is obvious that God must transcend all the dimensions in the existence that he has created, then it should be no problem for Jesus to move easily between dimensions. Thus, when he appeared in the upper room to the apostles, he was simply stepping from the spiritual dimension that we are familiar with (at least in concept) into the physical dimension that we live in. Mary obviously moves between these dimensions in the same way as she has appeared to various persons down through history, including at Fatima, Lourdes, and Tepeyac, Mexico (Virgin of Guadalupe). It is also common Christian understanding that after our lives on earth, the resurrected body that we will eventually have will be physical but have far more capabilities (and permanence) than the sin laden one we have here.

This illustrates death by asphyxiation while bleeding, consistent with crucifixion, which tends to suffocate the victim rather than cause death from blood loss.” This conclusion is wrong, wrong, wrong. So if the sudarium does, indeed, identify a victim that died from asphyxiation, it was not covering the face of a crucifixion victim. Dr. Frederick Zugibe demonstrated in his 1988 book, The Cross and the Shroud, updated in 2005 in The Crucifixion of Jesus, that crucifixion puts no undue pressure on the chest cavity and therefore could not cause asphyxiation. I don’t know why this notion persists since anyone can easily disprove it. Just stand up and extend your arms outward. Stand on your toes for more verisimilitude. Feel any pressure on your chest? No, of course not. Here’s the point: crucifixion victims are not hanging. They are standing. On a nail. Or maybe a small wooden support if time on the cross were to be prolonged. But the effect on the skeletal structure is the same as standing on your feet. You are not hanging. Even if you were hanging with your arms outstretched, it would not cause asphyxiation. Only by hanging with the arms directly overhead is there sufficient pressure on the chest cavity to possibly cause asphyxiation. Still don’t believe me? Here’s a little experiment you can try: Find a vertical wall. Nail a pair of shoes on that wall and two handles where your hands would be on outstretched arms if you were standing in the shoes. Get someone to help you (“spot” your “gymnastics” so you don’t hurt yourself) and try it. You will find that you could stay there all day as far as your lungs are concerned. But other parts of your body. That’s a very different story. Lastly, I appeal to common sense. The pains and agonies of crucifixion were so severe that if a victim could end his life by simply hanging loosely and letting asphyxiation do him in, probably the only one in history who would not have taken this route would have been Jesus who had a specific divine mission in mind for his crucifixion..","date":"2015-11-30","mins":"9:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"id":"comment-215403","author":"jim_carney","post":"Daveb, alas, my most admired commentator has some clay in his feet. You are missing the point entirely. It is not whether nails are used or gloves or any other device that has more or less torture involved. There is no asphyxiation because the victim is standing, not hanging. And theoretical scenarios–or even mathematically constructed ones–about the weight on one’s arms does not change that fact. If the weight of 207 lbs or whatever was too much for the human body to bear, the arms would have broken and death or injury would have ensued. That obviously did not happen–ever, apparently, given the huge number of crucifixions of slaves, criminals, rebels, etc. Etc. As for how crucifixions were physically accomplished, I suspect you are a man of letters (clearly) more than a man of labor, much less an engineer. After severe beatings, such as those described for Jesus in the scourging, and who knows what other deprivations prior to the time of crucifixion (hunger, general abuse, not to mention the paralyzing fear of impending crucifixion), it seems highly unlikely that prisoners were required to drag the entire cross to Calvary. It’s not practical. In some, perhaps most cases, it would not even be possible. Further, leaving the posts upright in the ground was a reminder to all the passersby that crucifixion awaits those who defy the Roman rule–which is exactly what the Romans hoped to accomplish by these horrific executions–and why they staged them at crossroads and other highly visible public places. Further, once the prisoner arrives at the place of crucifixion with the cross beam, it is not difficult but easy to pull the post out of the ground, lay the cross beam in its already cut slot in the post, fasten the two pieces together, nail the victim onto the assembled cross, then using a team of one or two persons per side pull the whole assemblage up with ropes into the hole where the post resides. Trying to lift a heavy cross beam with the dead weight of a squirming, screaming victim into some slot in the post would be the worst possible way to accomplish this task. So we need not speculate nor calculate the weight on the victim’s arms while his feet are nailed into the upright post, a much more difficult task, by the way, than nailing while he is lying down.

Since the body we have here on earth is subject to disease and deterioration leading to death, obviously the bodies of the faithful in heaven will be of a very different kind. One cannot live forever in the body that we have on earth. And it has long been Catholic teaching, and I believe mainline Protestant teaching as well, that the nature of our physical existence here on earth reflects the nature of our souls, which is subject to the sinfulness generated by being descendants of Adam and Eve. Having been redeemed by Christ, our admittance to heaven will be free from any kind of sinfulness or weakness or disease or defect. It is also logical to assume that such heavenly bodies will have greater abilities than the ones we inhabit here. We also get an idea of the nature of our beings in the next life by considering the gospel accounts of the transfiguration of Jesus. See, for example, Luke 9:28 31. Besides Jesus being changed in appearance with his clothes dazzlingly white, Moses and Elijah also appeared “in glory” (v. 31) with him. As for his appearance after the resurrection, it was important that Jesus appear in the form that he presented during his life on earth so that the apostles would understand that it was the crucified Jesus who was now resurrected. This is the message of the resurrection down the ages to all of us: we who are faithful to the teachings of Christ will live on after death in glory with him. No matter what form Jesus might have chosen to appear in after his resurrection, in his crucifixion he took on the weight of mankind’s sins and obtained God’s forgiveness for them to the extent that those who try to live by Jesus’ teachings can draw upon the grace obtained for all of us by his sacrifice. Thus we are made whole by Christ’s sufferings and can share eternal life with him accordingly. You are missing the whole point of the sacrificial redemption of Christ if you think it has anything to do with the form of his appearance after his resurrection. Finally, we don’t need a theory to explain how angels and other heavenly figures (for example, the Blessed Virgin Mary) can appear on earth in corporeal bodies. God can empower such transformations, appearances and transitions as he wishes.

Zugibe’s two books utilizing multiple volunteers irrefutably rebutted Barbet’s asphyxia hypothesis as well as his untested imaginings of the crucified person raising and lowering himself on the cross in order to breathe. Zugibe demonstrated in his book, The Crucifixion of Jesus (2005), p. 117 that it is not possible to raise oneself at all. He used healthy volunteers fastened to a cross in a position of outstretched arms at 65 degrees with knees bent at 120 degrees (the positions postulated by Barbet and confirmed by historical evidence for Christ’s crucifixion as well as physiological responses to outstretched arms and feet fastened flat against the upright beam of the cross). No volunteer was able to budge upward. The reason is that the body in this position does not permit the muscles of the arms and legs to exert force in the right direction. Could a trained gymnast using his arms only as if in the rings event raise himself? Possibly, but obviously beaten and tortured crucifixion victims were hardly comparable to trained gymnasts. I tested Zugibe’s experiments myself about 20 years ago using shoes nailed to a vertical wall and handles at the outstretched limits of my arms for support. In fact, I could not raise myself. The only way to gain relief from the immediate and severe cramping that began in the legs and shoulders was to try to lean forward as much as possible. Leaning backward as little as that could be done only increased the pressure on the hands and feet. So there was no way the crucifixion victims could obtain any relief by transferring their weight between arms and legs. Such transfers cannot be done. In all of this, there was no discernible pressure on my diaphragm to restrict breathing. And because it is the skeletal structure that is supporting the body, the weakness of any of the musculature is wholly irrelevant for determining the response of the crucified victim. One does not “hang” more because of weakness in the legs. Nor is there any significant weight on the hands and wrists. As I mentioned earlier, stand up and hold your arms out. That’s what gravity is doing to your body whether you are crucified or not. All the supposition about needing to nail through the wrists in order to support the body is wrong with a possible exception for victims who for whatever reason were not supported by their feet. This would include, for example, those for whom the skeletal structure is broken when the legs were fractured as the gospels tell us happened to the two criminals executed with Jesus. And as I noted earlier, Barbet’s chapter 3 on the causes of Christ’s death depends in part upon the reported observations of his colleague, Dr. Le Bec. But Le Bec was observing prisoners whose arms were pulled directly over their head (which does constrict the diaphragm) and whose feet were not touching the ground. Comparing the crucifixion experience of Jesus to this is like comparing not just apples to oranges but apples to bananas. Barbet could carry out experiments until the cows came home and it would not compare to using volunteers who actually simulated the conditions of crucifixion. Besides, experiments are only as good as their correspondence to reality. Zugibe noted in his 1988 book that Barbet was wrong in his connection of Destot’s space (down near the little finger) with the median nerve, which runs up near the thumb. As for the actual cause of death, traumatic and hypovolemic (loss of fluids) shock is more than ample to explain Christ’s death on the cross. Even Barbet noted the severe dehydration that would have occurred given the extreme suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and the multiple beatings, including the scourging and crowning with thorns, that Jesus endured. Severe dehydration and the shock that follows from it is, I believe, the main cause of death from cholera. Traumatic shock, resulting from severe and unrelenting pain, would obviously have been at work here too. When the body goes into shock, the heart is unable to pump properly, tissues and organs begin to die, and heart failure follows unless remedial measures are taken. As a certified medical examiner with decades of experience, Zugibe certainly was qualified to make this call. But note that when a body in shock begins to fail, respiration will also be affected. Breathing may be labored for awhile and in the end will obviously cease. This is not death by asphyxiation but a manifestation resulting from other causes. Finally, I do not believe nor have I ever heard it suggested that the two dimensional Shroud of Turin image of the crucified Jesus indicates that he died of asphyxiation. Since he could not have, that is obviously not a valid conclusion from anything that could be deduced from the Shroud..","date":"2015-12-02","mins":"1:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"}]}
