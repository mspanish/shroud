{"image":[{"author":"carl","post":"It was during a TV program concerning the Shroud of Turin, that I learned some things about Leonardo De Vinci which were quite a surprise. Some things I believe were on the program I will relate.\n  Leonardo De Vinci who was much more than a painter, did have access to the equipment which produced negative images like those found on the cloth of Turin. There were a small number of people who were performing the process and the idea was beginning to take hold in different areas. De Vinci had plenty of time on his hands while he stayed with a royal family. This hospitality was what allowed him to gain access to the equipment needed to produce the Shroud. At this time the very same type images could be produced on a lesser scale than the shroud. He was in the area that produced these images through a special heating process. He loved to have challenges. He put one of the lesser images on one end of the cloth and the other half of the body on the bottom end of the cloth,to produce the whole effect and therefore created a large production. He loved to show mirror images in his paintings. De Vinci  already had created images also, behind many of his paintings. Many of his paintings like the “Mona Lisa” showed features of his very own face.  Restorers of his works are the professionals who discovered these images beneath his paintings. De Vinci could get his hands on materials which were very old to use for the cloth of the shroud. He loved to dupe people so he could be the very one who would let you believe it was Jesus on the shroud. He was very creative and would invent, think, research, paint, build and would not mention to anyone what little secrets went along with his invention or paintings. He felt good to see he could fool people. He was a perfectionist and would be quite precise to make sure he did the most excellent job. Whatever it took to make it look real is what he would do. When De Vinci passed away at this royal household, the Shroud of Turin was on display very close by.\n\n","date":"September 19, 2009 at 3:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/03/08/a-new-comment-promoted-on-tetherd-cow-ahead-discussion-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A New Comment Promoted on Tetherd Cow Ahead Discussion on the Shroud of Turin"}]}
