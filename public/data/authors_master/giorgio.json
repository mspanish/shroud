Basically showing a richness in details that have not been surpassed by the quality of all the photographs that have been taken since 1931. Another factor that makes the Enrie photographs the best ones to use is the fact that he also used photographic glass plates of up to 40 x 50 cm to make the photographs of the face and other details and that he had the opportunity to control the lighting and exposure times at his leisure.\nProf. Fanti and Privitera’s paper titled “Constructive of Quantitative image of Turin Shroud for Details Recognition” provides XYZ measurements from the 2002 Durante’s transparency. If we were to use an XYZ sampling from the measurements provided in Fanti/Privitera’s paper  we can get an approximate quantitative measurement on how much details are lost with the use of Enrie’s Orthochromatic film which is not sensitive to the color red compared to pan-chromatic film photographing the Shroud of Turin. \nSince, we are discussing the renditioning of the 3d hologram of the face on the Shroud we can randomly find samplings from 17 areas by utilizing the colorimetric data in fig. 6 from the Fanti/Privitera’s paper.  I decided to use the designation “k” that contain XYZ values as 0.486  0.422  .0.093.  To simplify any calibration procedures you can convert XYZ value to a PMS color, which converts to, 7411 build. To further simplify the procedure you can convert the PMS color into RGB readings.  Approx. R: 234 G: 169 B: 112 . Using any rasterizing photo program that allows you to toggle channels on and off, create a file filling the background with the RGB build stated above. Using your marquee create another box overlapping the file so you can create two halves. I selected PMS Pantone Bright Red since the red value was maxed at 255 and the rest followed as green 64 and blue 50. Now that you have a file with 1/2 of the image with a build of 234,169,112 the other 255,64,50 go ahead and toggle the red channel on and off. Not surprisingly, there’s a lot of blue and green light still available to create a latent image on the Enries’ photo. Better yet these XYZ values are from Durante’s transparencies and not from the Shroud. The problem is taking a quantitive value from a scanned transparency one would  expect lightness (L) values measured in CIELAB values to decrease substantially.  That would mean the values given from fig 6 are in fact already degraded from the original subject (SHROUD). So one can make the assumption that sample k taken from the original Shroud would have had higher green and blue RGB values increasing the linear characteristics on Enries’ ortho film between image area to non-image area of the Shroud. If one was to continue sampling and compare non-image area with the image area throughout the Shroud you can determine the linear characteristic which then can be quantified how much exposure increase is needed to compensate for the ortho film and you can compare how much destructive interference had occurred between image area and non-image area compared to pan-chromatic film.\nKeep in mind, I’m not professing  there isn’t any destructive interference occurring using Ortho film with the Shroud as the subject, however it’s not as great as the critics tend to have us believe.\n\n","date":"January 16, 2013 at 11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/16/petrus-soons-anaglyph-vs-mario-latendresses-at-schroudscope/","cat":"art","title":"Petrus Soons’ Anaglyph vs Mario Latendresse’s at SchroudScope"},{"author":"giorgio","post":"Hello Mario.\nYou can find his excerpt at: http://shroud3d.com/making-of-the-holograms/enrie-photographs\n“THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF GIUSEPPE ENRIE 1931” \nThe link read in it’s entirely, can be very confusing, at least for me.\n\n","date":"January 16, 2013 at 3:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/16/petrus-soons-anaglyph-vs-mario-latendresses-at-schroudscope/","cat":"art","title":"Petrus Soons’ Anaglyph vs Mario Latendresse’s at SchroudScope"},{"author":"giorgio","post":"Same link I just cut and paste it. Last paragraph starting from the third sentence.\nEnrie Photographs\n Making of the Holograms\nGiuseppe Enrie 1931.\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHS OF GIUSEPPE ENRIE 1931\nWhen in September 2005 we had produced the first hologram of the face based on a black and white photograph (slide) of the face made by Barrie Schwortz during the STURP investigations of 1978 I made an appointment with Prof. Alan Whanger in January of 2006, knowing that he was in the possession of about 35 high grade second- and third-generation photographic prints that were donated to him by Father Francis L. Filas, who had a set of first-generation negatives. Alan also had three prints from the original Enrie negatives, obtained for him from Turin by Father Peter Rinaldi. The Holy Shroud Guild gave him blanket permission to use them.\nAfter seeing the hologram Alan Whanger made available for me these negatives that I took to the Netherlands to have them digitized. Why did we use the Enrie negatives to produce the next holograms ?\nIn May 1931 the Shroud’s owner, King Victor Emmanuel 3rd of Savoye, agreed to have a new series of photographs made on occasion of a Shroud exposition that was held that year and the photographer that would make these photographs was a professional photographer, GIUSEPPE ENRIE. The last time that photographs had been taken was in 1898 when Secondo Pia had made the famous series that showed that the image on the Shroud was like a photographic negative and that set in motion the scientific interest in the Shroud. Since then there had been great advances in photographic technologies and Enrie had moreover the possibility to make his shots with the Shroud not covered by glass. He photographed the complete Shroud in 3 sections and could also make a series of life-size close-ups of the face, the back and the shoulders and also of the bloodstain on the wrist area of the left arm.\nIn 1931, the most reliable light-sensitive material was an orthochromatic emulsion on a glass plate. This emulsion was sensitive to the blue and green elements of white light and insensitive to red. The result was that the red components of the Shroud image were not picked up and produced a sort of transparency, increasing the difference with the green and blue elements of the white light. Because the image on the Shroud is made up almost entirely of a yellow-reddish coloration, this is highlighted on an orthochromatic plate, allowing an excellent reproduction of the image and an enhancement of the image details, which made them very suitable for the conversion of 2D to 3D that we did later. Basically showing a richness in details that have not been surpassed by the quality of all the photographs that have been taken since 1931. Another factor that makes the Enrie photographs the best ones to use is the fact that he also used photographic glass plates of up to 40 x 50 cm to make the photographs of the face and other details and that he had the opportunity to control the lighting and exposure times at his leisure.\n\n","date":"January 16, 2013 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/16/petrus-soons-anaglyph-vs-mario-latendresses-at-schroudscope/","cat":"art","title":"Petrus Soons’ Anaglyph vs Mario Latendresse’s at SchroudScope"},{"author":"giorgio","post":"Mario i understand now.

That’s crucial here. Let’s analyze two photographs, one by Enrie, and one by Schwortz: The differences are obvious. On the Schwortz photo, the blood marks are much more intense in comparison with the body image, than on Enrie one. It is due to the fact that Enrie’s plates were much more sensitive in the yellow part of the visual spectrum, while Schwortz’ were more sensitive in red. The most important observation is, however, that the face on the Schwortz’ is much more intense than on Enrie, almost as intense as the blood marks –thus suggesting that it is actually created by the blood marks!\nCan you explain this further.

I don’t personally know what the chemical and physical characteristics of rose madder are. But, as the name implies, “rose” has a rosy color when impregnated in a linen fiber. It is not a permanent color because it is of organic origin (the plant is Rubia tinctoria). The extract, purpurin, is more permanent than rose madder. Joe Kohlbeck, on the other hand, is both a microscopist and chemist with Hercules Industries in Salt Lake City, Utah. His observation about the change of color in cargille oil is significant and one you can “take to the bank.” \nAgreed. This was one of the major catalyst that promoted Sue Bedfords, invisible weave theory. Keep in mind, The area that Dr. Kohlbeck was working on was the frontal view of the spear wound. All he was trying to do is improve the resolving power by “floating the sticky tape” onto a microscope slide to photograph.  According to McCrone and Nitowski notes, slide 6 BF is similar by observation to slide 3 CB that it contains (agglomerates). According to McCrone, the agglomerates is iron oxide (red ochre artist pigment) Other say it’s blood (Very red) While in contact with cargile oil for three months the supposedly inorganic agglomerates now turns yellow and black and forms a yellow amorphous tubular flaked like material resin that Nitowski believes it’s either blood or myrrh. Kohlbeck also thought it was blood but after a lengthy discussion with Sue Bedford he agreed that it maybe the dye that was used in the invisible weave theory. He admitted to me he only concluded it was blood because of Dr. Heller’s work.\nSo back to my original point both McCrone failed to mentioned this in his book and Dr. Rogers should have addressed this issue as well in his last paper.

So if you do believe in the invisible weave you also have to except the hypothesis stated by Paul Maloney.\n” The yellow amorphous tubular flaked like material resin was possibly also the same thing Dr. Nitowski saw and was convinced it was Myrrh and aloes just as Dr. McCrone first thought. Steven Schafersman is also correct when he states the madder root was first announced by Dr. McCrone.  This is also confirmed by Paul Maloney, President of ASSIST at a Talk given at the “The Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi-Faceted Enigma” conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14-17th 2008, when he states, “Walter McCrone had sent him in 1981 several Kodak transparencies of photos he took of Shroud linen fibers. “On those slides, (Guild also has them) McCrone had written the following note: madder rose, linen fiber, medium (blue) sample 3 CB” 4 and sample 3-AB. McCrone was referring to photomicrographs made on STURP sticky tape samples 3-CB and 3-AB which came from the blood flow across the back nearest the side-strip side of the Shroud and directly adjacent to that flow on linen, itself. It was on that side where someone would have been working their repairs if the re-weave theory is held to be correct. McCrone, of course, due to his belief that the Shroud was painted by an artist, was trying to prove that the Shroud had been in an artist’s studio.” Source: Maloney, Paul C. “What Went Wrong With the Shroud’s Radiocarbon Date? Setting itall in Context.” Talk given at the “Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi-Faceted Enigma”conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14-17th 2008.\nComments: Regarding the presence of madder rose on the cloth, Maloney says, “There is now a\nnew way of looking at the presence of that madder rose. Although this is some distance from the\n“Raes Corner” such trace amounts can now be conjectured to explain the dye that was used,\nalong with the aluminum mordant and the gum Arabic as a binder to create the wash to finish the\nre-weave.

Although details of the technique are covered on\npages 30-40 in this report, the principle of the technique involved\nthe production of negative photographic prints from color and black and\nwhite positive transparencies. Originally designed as an expedient\nphoto printing process by this investigator in 1971, the negative print\ntechnique was applied to the ERTS imagery for image enhancement. With\nthe negative print technique applied to band 5, cultural landscapes in\nterms of urban and suburban areas, shopping centers, highway construction\nsites, strip mines, and agricultural areas were enhanced in dark tones\nagainst a light background. On band 7 negative prints, water and\ntopographic surfaces were enhanced in light tones and light shaded\nenhancements on dark surfaces displayed as tone reversals in the\nnegative prints (see Figure 4).\nThe mapping of photomorphic regions and examples of landscape change\noccupied the majority of the Phase III activities. \nCan we consider this as a possible working solution to landuse\nmapping?

The interpreter or VP-8 machine operator selects the color assignments for different densities and also determines, in part, the spatial distribution of density levels. He can combine density levels into a common color unit and thus obliterate detailed information. Conversely, the interpreter can display up to 8 density color slices and combinations with highly detailed definition. It is this kind of subjectivity in the choice of density combinations which alarms some investigators. No single interpreter, interpretation system, or for that matter data gathering device, or sensor can possibly meet the needs of every\ninvestigation. The VP-8 must be used with caution with the understanding that it produces color coded densities which the interpreter must choose to display.\nGiorgio \nI like to add that the negative print Technique allows less deviation between operators because you’re basically producing a high contrast image with limited gray scales. Another limitation can be the aperture of the microdensitometer used to gather the sampling. In this program above, a 25 microdensitometer was used. 10 micros is the  minimum for Stochastic reproduction.

And adding to the mix, a superimposed image imprinted on the linen that is represented by dots, banding becomes more obvious. Here is a basic explanation I found on line. \nIn commercial printing, continuous tone is simulated by dots (called halftone dots) printed in rows (called lines or line screens). Lines are printed at different angles to make the rows less noticeable. \nThis explanation is also the basis for security printers to stop forgeries from using copiers to reproduce images simply by adding line frequencies with dot frequencies.\n\n","date":"October 20, 2013 at 7:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/19/todays-how-do-we-know-banding-patterns-and-what-they-might-mean/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Today’s How do we know?

The key function of the Fourier transform filters is to manipulate  specific frequencies. Using this method to conclude chemical analysis to me is very confusing. I would think using a spectrometer would be a better tool. \nThe uniformity of the banding is throughout the shroud. Let me clarify what I mean by uniformity. Today, paper mills adds whiteners to brighten the paper’s white. Printing over these inexpensive papers causes havoc.   Because opaque inks such as spot colors printed on these papers does cause the ink to fluoresce, viewing in different color temperatures these inks will shift hues accordingly to the light source because of the chemical make up of the ink.  However having said that, because of the different frequencies and angles that the spot color inks are laid down on the paper, fluorescing becomes very erratic.  For this reason I would  expect the Shroud’s  variegated markings to have sharp breaks and erratic pattern shapes not uniform or smooth transitions where strips go up and down throughout the shroud. We also have to expect that contaminates have been introduced throughout the Shroud’s history which should caused more erratic patterns. \nThis is why I believe the banding is caused by the linen’s converging screen angles and frequencies. And using the Fourier transform filter is a tool to filter unwanted screen frequencies and should not be used to reach a chemical analyze conclusion.\nKeep in mind, I’m not saying that bleach was not used on the linen. I have no clue.  all I’m saying is Fourier transform filters prints can’t tell you that bleach was used.\n\n","date":"October 21, 2013 at 10:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/19/todays-how-do-we-know-banding-patterns-and-what-they-might-mean/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Today’s How do we know?
