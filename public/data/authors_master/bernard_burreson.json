{"dating":[{"author":"bernard_burreson","post":"I am convinced that the shroud is not at all related to the one from Jesus because of what the scriptures say. In Isaiah, we find that the beard of Jesus was plucked out (the shroud shows a beard), and that he was marred more than any man.  To be marred more than any other man would have be extremely brutal.  I believe that this is saying that Jesus was totally disfigured from appearing human. Even the movie “The Passion of the Christ,” does not do justice to what Isaiah says happened to Jesus.  To be marred more than any other man would leave Him completely unrecognizable.  This is probably why the disciples did not recognize Him on road to Emmaus.  Also, why would Thomas need to see the nail holes in Jesus’ hands, or the sword hole in His side, unless He was unrecognizable facially? The versus below confirm this.\nThus the shroud is not that of Jesus since it is a fairly recognizable face.\nIsa 50:6  I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.\nIsa 52:14  As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:\nThus there was no need for any further testing. However, the carbon date testing simply verifies that the Shroud is not from the time of Jesus, and thus the data should be believed.\n\n","date":"November 2, 2015 at 6:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/20/carbon-date-the-shroud-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Carbon Date the Shroud Again?"}]}
