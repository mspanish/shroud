{"history":[{"author":"colinsberryron","post":"I must correct an error in my first paragraph, which is very essential: that being the times. First “from my understanding”, the death of Christ occured on the 1st of April 33ad, not the 3rd day as that was the day of ressurection. On April 1st 33ad the sun set at 6:33 pm (approx) that then changes the times allowed for burial preparation to anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes (approx); If my Sudarium findings are adhered too. Although this may leave just 30 minutes in one regard, one must also be aware of the next comment… \nI have also found in my readings of the Tulmud, Mishna that there were concessions for burials on the EVE of a Sabbath or Passover, whereas the stipulation ‘excused’ the buriers, and allowed the burial procedures to continue into the Sabbath, so as the body may be properly interred before darkness fell. Jewish law was very adamant that no body should be unburied overnight….Max you seem pretty knowledgeable on the Talmud, Mishna, Am I correct in these findings?\nRon\n\n","date":"March 20, 2012 at 3:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/14/nonsense-of-the-day-comments-on-banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","title":"Nonsense of the Day: Comments on “Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different”"}]}
