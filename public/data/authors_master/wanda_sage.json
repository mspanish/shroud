{"art":[{"author":"wanda_sage","post":"In 1968 my sister became critically ill with peritonitis, her appendix had ruptured, it was not obvious at the time of the initial surgery, and she developed peritonitis, she was given only a 5% chance of surviving, in 1968 peritonitis was considered a death knell for the patient, and today still can be, I will never forget seeing my dad walking in the back door and his shoulders and back slumped, he said we need to pray for “our sister”. Pray is what I did, and ran to a refuge to ask them to pray for my sister, as she was dying.My sister was in a coma, in ICU and hospitalized for 6 weeks, she survived, when she came out of her coma she told our mother that she has two mothers, one in heaven and one on earth, and her other mother’s name in heaven is Mary, and she lived in heaven. My sister has been blessed ever since then.","date":"November 18, 2012 at 1:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/22/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud-revisited/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud Revisited"}]}
