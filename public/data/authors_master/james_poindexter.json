{"art":[{"author":"james_poindexter","post":"On July 5, 2010, I had a heart attack.   My wife did CPR that saved my life.   I was transported to the hospital and was there for about 13 days.   During that time, I was taken to Heaven by Mary, Our Lady.   She took me to Jesus, Her Son.    I was given a choice to return or to continue.   I chose to return.   The hospital staff and my doctors said it would take a year for me to recover to a more normal standard.   On July 5, 2011, my wife and I left on a pilgrimage to give thanks for the gift of life.   I did have a second heart attack in November of 2010.    On our pilgrimage, a cousin of my mother in laws gave me the book Heaven is for Real.   Although our experiences were very different, I could relate to the experience that Colon did have.   I found the picture of Akiane’s Prince of Peace to be comfortable and warming to me.    I am still healing in many ways.   Heaven is Real and that is the gift Our Lady gave to me.   To take away any doubt.    Believe.\n\n","date":"August 6, 2011 at 10:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
