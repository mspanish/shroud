That’s why your argument that L is more probable than other letters is flawed. If you’ve ever played Tetris you’ll know that there are exactly seven ways to place four circles on adjacent points of a grid, which become five if you consider mirroring patterns as identical. So if you ask, if the artist was placing circles at random, what is the probability that he would build an L shaped pattern, I’d answer: 1/5. Not so low that it couldn’t happen by chance, but not insignificant either. Also, you claim that the same L shaped pattern is represented on other illustrations of the Pray Codex. If the artist was just drawing circles at random, chances are he’d have used different patterns. If instead he always consistently used the same pattern, that must mean it had some significance..","date":"2012-06-04","mins":"3:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/02/a-masterly-demolition-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Masterly Demolition of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"id":"comment-12090","author":"onan_the_barbarian","post":"Your Google search is obviously biased by the choice of the search words.
