I got kicked out twice the second time for selling drugs .. Always kept in mind my whole life for some odd reason I would use this Jesus /God if I was ever in a bind .. /911. When I was 21 iwas at a party with about 50 people I didn’t know a lot of bad people. Got into a fight at least ten of them. They beat me to the point I said under my breath Jesus please have mercy on me don’t let me die cause they wont have mercy on me.

Now the fool says in his heart there is no God.","date":"2012-01-05","mins":"1:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}],"history":[{"id":"comment-1213","author":"adam","post":"Hi Finally got to see your face & voice in action too when it replayed here in Australia.
