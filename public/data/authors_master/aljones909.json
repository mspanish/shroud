I’m reasonably normal and get a length of 35.5 cm.The corresponding mesurement on the shroud is around 20cm.This is a totally impossible result if a continuous cloth covered the front and back of the head.

He has the “answer”. he just needs to make the data fit.These revolutionary dating techniques will never be heard of again (just like Rogers’ vanillin method).

A furious David Sox released the list of tests to The Times, which published it on the front page. Coero-Borga’s reasoning was that “the Pollen Test has given very positive results with regard to the age and history of the Shroud” and should be extended across a wider area. This is, of course, completely wrong: the pollen can only be used to date the shroud if one assumes that it was in Palestine at the time of the crucifixion of Jesus, a completely circular argument.”The carbon dating is hard evidence.
