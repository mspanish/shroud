In 1997, she contacted Fr. Joseph Marino, a Benedictine Monk and Catholic Priest at a St. Louis Abbey.

When initially set up, it had a radiocarbon subcommittee (composed of Robert Dinegar, Ray Rogers and David Sox), but was not included on the list of authorised tests released on 24 April 1978 by Don Piero Coero-Borga of the Centro Internazionale di Sindonologia. A furious David Sox released the list of tests to The Times, which published it on the front page. Coero-Borga’s reasoning was that “the Pollen Test has given very positive results with regard to the age and history of the Shroud” and should be extended across a wider area. This is, of course, completely wrong: the pollen can only be used to date the shroud if one assumes that it was in Palestine at the time of the crucifixion of Jesus, a completely circular argument.”\nThe carbon dating is hard evidence. The laboratories were the best in the world.\nThey dated 3 other pieces of cloth as well. These samples had known dates derived from historical and archeological evidence.\nSample 2 was from a Nubian tomb and was known to have a date around 1100.  The labs dated it within 20 years of it’s known date.\nSample 3 was a sample from a mummy around 2,000 years old. The labs dated it within 60 years of it’s known date.\nSample 4 was a sample from the cope of St. Louis d’Anjou. The ‘known’ date was around 1273. The labs dated it within 30 years of it’s known date.\nSample 1 was a sample from the Shroud of Turin. First certain historical date 1390 (but disputed dates going back to 1350). The mean date from the 3 labs was 1325.\nNote. For clarity I’ve omitted details of the uncertainties quoted for each date.
