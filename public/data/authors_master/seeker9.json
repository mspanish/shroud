Some experts have also noted key similarities between the face on the Shroud and that of Da Vinci himself\nBut Da Vinci appears to have been born way too late in terms of what some consider to be historical references to the shroud e.g the Holy Mandylion of Edessa or the Pray Manuscript. \nThen again, it could be argued that if it is indeed man-made, the “artist” used an ancient piece of cloth and had seen the Pray manuscript and added those finishing details to the image….\nBut then there’s the possible relationship with the Sudarium of Oviedo….\nSo, I will not say it is fake or real\nI just think it is absolutely magnificent regardless \nAnd I am Sikh not Christian!\n\n","date":"April 4, 2011 at 6:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/30/new-3d-rendering-of-the-shroud-of-turin-face-by-john-chen/","cat":"image_theory","title":"New 3D Rendering of the Shroud of Turin Face by John Chen"}]}
