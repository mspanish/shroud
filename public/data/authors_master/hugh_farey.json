My email address is openly available, and my editorship transparent to the world with every update of shroud.com. If anybody wants me dismissed they are very welcome to let me know, but nobody has yet, even though the vast majority of the BSTS are authenticists, and know very well that I am not.

I have no evidence that Paul Gell is a desperate sceptic; have you? He comes across as someone who has discovered a coincidence, explored it further, but ended up drifting further and further from likelihood. There are indeed eerie similarities to some people’s interpretation of the Pray Codex. I hope he reads past your unhelpful comments and gets to mine!Hi Paul, thanks for bringing the sarcophagus of Pierre de Corneillan to our attention. I have not seen it before, and wonder how it fits in with other contemporary sarcophagi. It does indeed have some resemblance to the Shroud, particularly, as you say, in terms of the slightly parted beard and the crossed hands.However, I’m sorry to say that I disagree with every single one of your alleged correspondences. In keeping with my practice of taking every posting on the blog with consideration, I set off to write a detailed explanation of why, but – and I do apologise if I’m wrong – I fairly soon came to the conclusion that this is indeed, as suggested, above, a joke. Am I right? Just in case you’re serious, here are a couple of things you need to check.1) Late 1355 is very much the extreme edge of a credible manufacture date for the Shroud. I don’t know when the bas relief was made, but it may not have been until the following year, which I think would pretty well rule out the possibility of the Shroud having been made in Rhodes and then hurriedly rushed to Lirey for its first display. Furthermore, Pierre de Corneillan was a Hospitaller, while Geoffroi de Charny was probably (if he was related to the earlier Geoffroi who was burnt at the stake), very much of Templar stock. If the Shroud was made by Hospitallers in Rhodes, it would more likely have been sent to a Hospitaller in France for display, no?2) Your claim that various bits of one image match various bits of the other depends on your knowing exactly how big the two images actually are. As you seem simply to have superimposed two pictures in photoshop, how do you know that the measurements match in actuality?3) The Shroud has a) its famous image, which appears to be made of mildly oxidised linen, b) the marks of a serious scorching from a fire in 1532, which produced the dark lines and patched holes on either side of the image, c) the marks of a serious wetting, not associated with the fire, which made the big diagonal patches up and down the cloth, and d) the marks of some other burn damage from another time. The shroud can be demonstrated to have been folded in different ways for each of the last three incidents. You seem to think that all these marks were of similar manufacture made at the same time. (This was where I decided you had to be kidding, and were writing a deliberate parody!).4) And finally – what about the back image? Was that modelled on the sarcophagus too? I look forward to your next video!","date":"February 21, 2015 at 1:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/21/a-bas-relief-match-to-the-shroud-of-turin-image/","cat":"art","title":"A Bas Relief Match to the Shroud of Turin Image?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Good point, renny.

I think a good introduction to the Shroud, with sources, would be Ian Wilson’s most recent book (2010) entitled The Shroud; Fresh Light on a 2000 year old Mystery.

He, interestingly, suggests that the first Pantocrator image may have derived from a statue of Zeus (removed from Olympia in 394 and finally destroyed in 462), which was roundly condemned by various church fathers (particularly Theodores Anagnostes), not because of its pagan origins, of which they were ignorant, but because it looked nothing like Jesus, who had short “frizzy” or “woolly” hair, as shown in various acheiropoietai, such as the one in Jerusalem described by the 6th century Anthony of Placentia, or according to a description in a (later) letter by John of Damascus, saying that the emperor Constantine had had images made “as the old authorities had described, with eyebrows that joined, fine eyes, a long nose, frizzy hair, a black beard…”Breckenridge discusses why Justinian might have reverted from one tradition to the other, and, to a certain extent, why the long-bearded Christ eventually returned, during the reign of Michael III. It certainly appears that there were at least two early traditions as to the appearance of Jesus, both based on miraculous images (epitomised by the Mandylion of Edessa – long haired – and the Image of Kamuliana – short haired), which struggled for universal acceptance until after the great iconoclasm, when Edessa won.","date":"October 23, 2012 at 1:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/23/a-good-question-about-justinian-ii-coins/","cat":"art","title":"A good question about Justinian II coins"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Really?

Moses has gaunt cheeks and white hair,  Andrew’s hair is white and slightly unkempt, John the Baptist has darker, longer and wilder hair than anybody, and Peter has a very full beard and looks like Zeus. In icons of the Last Supper almost all the apostles are instantly recognisable.In short, there most certainly are stock types for all the holy figures, and Jesus is just one of them.

A statement like “If the artist did not understand that as a result of a contact image rights and lefts are reversed the side wound would have been illustrated on the left side, not right side,” seems to me extraordinary. Why should an artist not understand that? It is not an intellectual challenge of any severity, I think.The question “Artist did not use plain weave white linen as used in Jewish Burial?!” is relevant. A burial shroud was never going to be seen again, but a ritual liturgical object was intended to be displayed publicly, and with solemnity and deep respect. An elaborate and expensive cloth makes more sense in the liturgical scenario than the burial one, although the bible’s rich man Joseph of Arimathea’s buying of a shroud offers a counterbalance to that argument.As for the other questions, they miss the point. The creator of the Shroud was not aiming at a picture of Christ as such, but at a ‘realistic’ depiction of the kind of image that might have appeared had the Shroud covered a dead man.Daveb misrepresents me completely. “To my mind Hugh is too locked-in to the results of the radiocarbon dating, and is unable to concede that they might be incorrect, or irrelevant.” This is nonsense, as he well knows. I have repeatedly conceded that the radiocarbon dates might be incorrect. I am also able to consider any evidence for the authenticist argument dispassionately and on its merits. On balance, as I have repeatedly explained, I think that the evidence for a medieval date is more convincing than the contrary evidence, but to claim that I am locked-in to my opinion is scurrilous.As an example, I fully appreciate that both the negativity, and its corollary, the 3D quality of the image, would seem to be remarkable accidental consequences of an artist attempting to simulate a sweat-induced image. However, Colin is working on a possible procedure that might do just that. “It is stretching the laws of unintended consequences to claim it as an accident” may be true, or perhaps not.

It is entirely typical of most authenticists, who like firmly to divide opinions on the shroud into two entirely separate and antagonistic camps, categorising those who do not think the shroud is genuine as anti- rather than non- authenticity, and usually as fanatical atheists desperate to bring about the downfall of Christianity. These people, we read, “ignore” all the evidence, are “locked-in” to their point of view, “unable to concede” any possible alternative. They are usually infantile morons as well. The truth, of course, is that many people, who hold both authenticist and non-authenticist opinions, are nevertheless able to understand and appreciate the views and evidence of those of the opposite opinions, and can engage in constructive debate about all of them.I agree with daveb, for example, that an Epitaphios serves its purpose as a metaphorical transposition of Burial Cloth to Altar Cloth, with its elaborate embroidery and clear and distinct image of Christ, and usually some people and angels as well. I pursued the idea that the Shroud itself might be an early version of such a function myself, but abandoned it for exactly the reasons daveb suggests. However, the Byzantine rites of the early centuries of the Church are far removed from those of medieval Europe, for whom a more realistic acting out of the discovery of the empty tomb, the angels and the Shroud, became encapsulated in the Quem Quaeritis ceremony. Real people represented the three Marys, others represented the angels, a real box represented the tomb and a real sheet represented the Shroud. The Shroud was brought to the altar and displayed to the people. If it bore an image (and to be fair, we have no evidence that this was customary), it was only a vague impression of the body which had lain in it, so as not to confuse it with the living presence of the risen Christ at the altar (a point made by OK some months ago). In this respect I differ from Charles Freeman, who thinks that the image was originally much brighter (but to be fair to him, pictures of the public exhibition of the Shroud do show a much clearer image, and descriptions of them seem to concur, which is why I postulated that there might have been two shrouds, one for veneration and one for exhibition).Just as non-authenticists differ in their interpretation of the evidence for a medieval provenance, so authenticists are also at considerable odds with each other, although they usually fragment into different camps which refuse, ignore, and are unable to accept, or at least unwilling to discuss the opinions of the others. The process by which the Shroud was formed, the attitude of the body and the Shroud itself, the events leading up to the covering of the body and, more philosophically, the meaning and possibility of a supernatural occurrence are all matters of dispute, and could fruitfully be matters of debate, if only people didn’t characterise those of a different opinion so negatively.","date":"May 3, 2015 at 3:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/28/having-nightmares/","cat":"art","title":"Having Nightmares"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The DNA of God might not consist of any peculiar genes, but rather a particular combination of ordinary genes, just as a particular combination of genes might predispose a child towards an excellence, given appropriate education, in Science, Athletics or the Arts.","date":"August 12, 2013 at 12:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here-is-a-crowdfunding-campaign-we-should-be-able-to-support/","cat":"art","title":"Here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"If something has happened to the Shroud to remove virtually all of the original pigment, it is sure not beyond the bounds of credibility that the outline was removed too, especially if it was in, say, charcoal, with no medium or binder to keep in in place.","date":"April 28, 2015 at 11:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/28/having-nightmares/","cat":"art","title":"Having Nightmares"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"chose","date":"August 12, 2013 at 6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here-is-a-crowdfunding-campaign-we-should-be-able-to-support/","cat":"art","title":"Here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yannick, suppose you had been responsible for delivering the C-14 samples to the labs.

In particular, I imagine Meacham’s paper “Radiocarbon Measurement and the Age of the Turin Shroud” was most carefully considered. Apart from the fact that the paper is almost wholly devoted to the unreliability of any carbon date from wherever taken, Meacham’s final, “tentative proposals” are as follows:1) a single thread from between the images. It’s hardly surprising this was rejected. It would not have had sufficient mass to be tested on its own, so would have to have been mixed in with another sample. If the two were of the same date, then it would make no difference whether the thread were present or not, and if they were different, then it would not be possible to distinguish them anyway.2) a small piece just in from the edge next to the Raes site. That’s what was finally taken.3) a piece of the charred cloth. Why? Meacham had spent an entire section of his paper explaining why such a sample could be more unreliable than all the rest.4) a piece of the side strip. Again, why? It might determine whether or not the side strip was the same age as the ret of the cloth, but whatever its date, it would not confirm the age of the main body of the cloth.5) a piece of the backing cloth. This was to be used as a control, and as it was three other controls were used instead.To be honest, having decided to carry out the C-14 test, Meacham’s very negative opinions regarding the accuracy of any such test at all hardly makes him a useful advisor.Gove, on the other hand, had suggested 3 20cm (eight inches?) weft threads and 2 or 3 warp threads of 63cm (probably 2 feet – was he working in old units?). It is not clear if he wanted each laboratory to be given these, or if they were to be divided by seven. If the former, then he actually wanted 21 weft and 14-21 warp threads to be extracted for the seven labs then postulated. (If the latter then there wasn’t enough material).It is easy to be wise after the event, but I do understand Gonella’s reluctance to cut dozens of threads out of the shroud, or to bother with pieces of contaminated charred material. It was clear from the science labs that added contaminant such as oils, soot or extraneous fibres was removeable beforehand. In 1977 a few inches of the backing cloth had been tentatively unpicked by nuns, and equally tentatively sewn back up again. To unpick the whole of one end and some distance up one or both sides may have been, as i suggested before, a sacrilege too far.One more thing: nobody at all, that I can find, considered the possibility that undetectable interweaving was a possible source of contamination, neither STURP not anybody else. Incidentally, did anybody else in STURP, apart from Meacham, suggest a sample site, or did they just complain about it afterwards?","date":"August 17, 2013 at 11:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here-is-a-crowdfunding-campaign-we-should-be-able-to-support/","cat":"art","title":"Here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"So why didn’t they do that? Setting aside deliberate dishonesty, I don’t think we can dismiss Gonella, Riggi or the others present as stupid. Gonella, especially, had been in contact with the leading researchers in the field for months. Gove, Meacham and others had indeed been listened to, and their views considered. I think there were two main reasons for not using pieces from under the patches, and although neither of them hold much water today, they were major factors at the time.The most important I think was that at the time they really thought there was a good chance that combustion could skew a C-14 dating. I don’t know whether that was based on evidence or just suspicion, but it does seem to have been a serious consideration, and even before the dating was carried out, would have had proponents of both sides claiming that if the date was not what they wanted, it was because of changes to the C-14 content due to the circumstances of the 1532 fire. Neither Gove nor Meacham could guarantee that this was impossible, or even unlikely.The second reason is that taking pieces from under a patch would have meant unpicking a long section of the backing cloth and folding the shroud back to find suitable spot. By 2002, of course, this wasn’t a problem, but even in 1988 the aura of ‘holiness,’ not just around the shroud but around every religious object – and person for that matter – was much stronger than it is today. It was verging on sacrilege for anyone other than a priest even to touch the cloth, and to pull it about quite so drastically may have seemed a secularisation too far.I always used to enjoy Stephen Jay Gould’s defences of various utterly discredited 19th century scientists because, although they were overtaken by progress, he never dismissed them as idiots but tried to explain what it was that made them think as they did.

The more threads extracted from different areas and mingled, the greater the possibility of an outlier. This too may have been a significant factor in deciding to take the sample from a single area only. (Ironically, therefore, it may have been in order to exclude the possibility of interweaving that the single sample was taken.)You’re right that Otlet didn’t think much of sampling the charred areas, which makes you wonder why Meacham suggested them. It’s no surprise that his suggestion was rejected.I think the only viable alternative to taking the test material from where it came from was to extract a minimum of three 3cm x 1cm samples from different areas of the cloth, and dividing them into three sets of three 1cm x 1cm squares for the three labs to test independently.

The words above do not appear in Schiller’s book, although the illustration does. Schiller, in fact, makes no mention of the Shroud of Turin at all. Nor is she so naive as to say that a large Shroud in art was a sudden appearance of the 11th century, as this is clearly not true.What Schiller does is to trace the first appearance of various scenes leading to the entombment in iconography. The earliest representations, dating from the 9th century, depict the ‘Bearing Of the Body’ (in which the body is invariably shrouded in a long cloth or strips of bandage). Next appears the ‘Entombment’ itself (10th century). Here again, Christ is usually fully shrouded. A century or so later we begin to find the ‘Annointing’ and the ‘Lamentation.’The former, of course, requires an at least partially exposed body, and nearly all the Lamentations I have seen show Christ in a loincoth, lying on a slab or table, which is often covered in a cloth, which may not be a shroud at all.. Schiller says that the origin of this scene, which has no biblical justification, “may derive from funeral customs in east and west.” She is also very conscious of the role that the Easter liturgy, and the paraphernalia associated with it, played in the development of entombment iconography.","date":"February 16, 2015 at 9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I commend your ingenuity, OK, but I think I could do much the same with Rasputin.

I felt that the Shroud Guild’s Facebook selection (not your fault) from your History somewhat exacerbated an impression that Gertrud Schiller, whose eminence in Christian iconography is undisputed, endorsed the idea that its evolution may have been in part derived from the ‘sudden’ appearance of the Shroud after centuries of obscurity, which she didn’t.Schiller did have ideas, but I have to say that she does not express them very clearly and her oeuvre is much more descriptive than explanatory. Essentially I think she sees the expanding liturgy as the prime mover, with the Anointment and Lamentation scenes (scenes particularly associated nowadays with the Shroud) being relatively late comers both liturgically and artistically. The Lamentation in art seems to have begun life at the foot of the Cross, before the body was enshrouded, and the Anointment seems to have begun just outside the tomb, necessitating at least a partial unwrapping. Later the sites of these scenes became both less well defined and more confused with each other, but I think that between them they account for the arrival of the uncovered body without the necessity of the sudden discovery of the Shroud. Sadly Schiller’s Volume 3, which covers the Resurrection and subsequent events, has not been published in English, but as we have examined in some detail on this site, the Three Marys scene, another particularly associated with the Shroud, shows a continuous development, without any surprises, from the 5th century or so onwards.In order to justify an influence on art of the Shroud, we really need to specify a date of revelation and what, precisely, was revealed (just the head? just one body? both bodies?). I don’t think this has been sufficiently defined, but if it ever were, I don’t believe that a comprehensive review of paintings and sculptures before and after that watershed would be sufficiently distinctive to justify it. If the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople in 944 is taken as the start point, then that presupposes that the Mandylion and the Shroud were the same, which is by no means generally accepted.Oh, and by ‘bad argument’, I’m sure Dan was not being rude.

The argument, this time as in the past, follows a well-worn route, and goes like this:1) These two images are identical in so many instances that anyone can see one must be directly derived from the other.2) Tiny detailed congruences are more significant than broadly obvious differences, such as the overall shape of the head and distribution of hair.3) Of course the artist did not copy the Shroud exactly, as he did not want to portray a dead body.4) The image on the Shroud shows such a battered face it is hardly surprising that the artist cleaned it up for his portrait.5) Although we now admit that the two images don’t look anything like each other, we still think it is perfectly obvious that they must be related.Well, it won’t do. Either the two images are an ‘exact match,’ (by some definition of ‘exact’) in which circumstance a case for identity can at least be claimed, or they are not, in which case it can’t. Of course, it’s not impossible that an artist, seeing a rectangular face, vertically falling hair, bushy moustache and prominent lower lip should nevertheless convert this to a triangular face, moulded hair, minimal moustache and prominent upper lip, but such a hypothesis cannot be defended on the strength of the images alone.","date":"August 24, 2014 at 8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","title":"Matching Faces.

I agree that the length under discussion is about 11cm, and that 11cm on the Shroud goes from the end of the phalanx to the wound, and that the 11cm on your hand goes from the end of the phalanx to the wrist. However, your hand is considerably smaller that than that of the Shroud man, as I showed in my own comparison of it. I do not believe that the knuckle of the finger under the ruler is under the 60cm mark (compare it to the knuckle of the thumb as a quick comparison). If, as I showed earlier, I enlarge your hand so that your phalanges match the Shroud’s phalanges, the wound is now more in the metacarpal than the carpal zone.And daveb, everything you have said about the medial and distal phalanges, and the tips of the fingers, is perfectly correct. They are difficult to see, possibly because they were not in contact with the cloth, and maybe the cloth was orthogonal to their plane. They are impossible to measure. That is why is have not mentioned them at all in my comments or calculations until this very moment.And yes, the wound does look as if it is in the wrist. I do not think that the generations of scholars who have supposed it to be in the wrist were blind or stupid. It does look as if the hand narrows at that point, just as hands do narrow at the attachment to the arms. However, the measurements suggest that our perception is faulty at this point. Just above the blood stain is a severe crease, and a deceptive line of blood which appears to define the edge of the arm, but actually doesn’t. This is my take on the actual outline of the arm:http://imgur.com/FaYARPG.And yes, hands do vary in size (which is why they have to be scaled for comparison), and to a certain extent, in proportion, but the metacarpals are invariably considerably longer than their proximal phalanges.","date":"February 25, 2015 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/maybe-the-nails-didnt-go-through-the-wrists/","cat":"art","title":"Maybe the Nails Didn’t Go Through the Wrists"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Here is the link: http://i.imgur.com/FaYARPG.png","date":"February 25, 2015 at 6:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/maybe-the-nails-didnt-go-through-the-wrists/","cat":"art","title":"Maybe the Nails Didn’t Go Through the Wrists"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"If the blood was deliberately added to the shroud to impart verisimilitude, I would say that it had been trickled on with some kind of pipette.

Some appears to have been a flow from a living person, which dried on the body but when remoistened made a contact with the cloth, some may have seeped directly from the dead body onto the cloth from an open wound, and some may have simply been contact stains from moist excoriations or abrasions.

This is on the basis that one sample which did disintegrate was mentioned in the Nature paper, although it is not specifically recorded that the others did not. Suppose is a perfectly valid word to use in this context.The sample that fell apart did so specifically because of its ‘loose weave,’ not because it was glued together with a water soluble glue. If any of the other samples had been held together by water soluble glue, they would have disintegrated as well.“No likelihood” does not mean 100% certainty. If I had meant there was no doubt at all, I would have said so.I have studied Robert Brown’s SEM paper carefully for months. His first (optical) photo appears to show an orange-brown thread with little white patches on it which he says represent the places where warp threads cross over it. However the first white patch appears on the crest of a wave, not in the trough, the second occurs on one side of a trough only, and the last trough shows no white patch at all. In a 3/1 twill weave, the underside of this thread would show the opposite – it would appear to be a white thread (being covered with three adjacent warp threads) little orange brown patches where it was exposed to the air. This is not apparent from the photo. I do not find his paper conclusive.Next, is it not a little disingenuous first to suggest that peer-review is a “starting point” for some degree of reliability, and then dismiss all the papers you disagree with as silly. Is it not a little biased to dismiss a paper published in his own journal by Jull, but not another paper published in his own journal by Rogers?And no, there is no evidence that the cotton fibres identified among the Oxford samples were ‘intertwined.’ Where did that idea come from?Obviously as fundamental to physics, all experiments are ultimately quantum science based, but there is no application of any current understanding of QED that is relevant to the Shroud.I don’t think it was particularly observant of Truzzi to declare that disputing one idea is not the same as proving its opposite. I’m so glad I don’t fall into that trap though!Can you name any of the “numerous articles” published in a peer reviewed journal that demonstrate that the carbon tests were flawed?And finally, can you quote the artifact that carbon dated further into the future than the current date?

They were, and they did. Any Gum Arabic, being soluble in water and destroyed by Sodium Hydroxide, was completely washed away in the cleaning process, and had no effect on the dating process at all, whatever date it was.

The entire ‘splice’ hypothesis and the evidence which supports it is inconsistent, from the relative amount of cotton to linen, to the nature of the ‘splices.’ Some have said that the interpolated threads were an intimate blend of cotton and linen (Fanti), others that separate threads of linen and cotton were twisted together (Benford), and others that two pieces of cotton were glued together end on (Villarreal). Even if some sort of ‘glue’ had been considered necessary to hold the shroud together, gum arabic would have been a silly choice as it goes very sticky under any kind of moisture, such as a bishop’s fingers, which would have ended up covered in shreds of mended shroud!All the labs cleaned their material remarkably thoughoughly. Vacuuming or ultrasound were used to remove loose foreign bodies, ether, ethanol or dertergent for fats, waxes and oils, and then various acid (hydrochoric), alkali (sodium hydroxide) and distilled water washes.

If, however, later “Three Marys” derived from the Pray picture, their artists clearly understood the skewed rectangle as a lid, not a sheet. However I don’t think the iconography of the Three Marys does stem from this picture. Queen Ingeborg’s Psalter is contemporary and shows a very similar scene, including a skewed lid, and there are earlier versions from the 10th century onwards with some of the relevant elements: from Italy, in Met Mus Art (10th Cent – ‘house’ style tomb with shroud, angel sitting on skewed surface), the Pontifical of Westminster (10th Cent – San Baudelio, Spain (no lid or shroud),  San Miguel, Estella, Spain (two angels lifting the lid, shroud in tomb), Aachen (1020, Antependium of Otto II, including skewed platform for angel, but a ‘house’ style tomb with shroud inside), the Bamberg Apocalypse (11th Century – angel sitting on sarcophagus, no lid, shroud in ‘house’ style tomb)  and several others.Thomas’s points are also valid, and I have not failed to address them. My response to the little circles is really “I don’t know.” I agree that they do not seem to be purely decorative, but I disagree that they are anything to do with some accidental chars in the shroud. I do not think that my ignorance should be taken as supportive of any hypothesis, however. On the Pray drawing of the seated Christ an acolyte also has rather clumsily placed little circles on his clothes, and it looks as if the artist started to fill the central strip and then gave up.

However I cannot see anyone insensing a picture of half someone’s naked back. I think the scenario would work just as well if the cloth were folded inwards rather than outwards, so that there was no visible image at all.2) The Pray manuscript has been discussed too many times to warrant it being brought up again. The rectangular blocks are clearly the tomb, not the cloth; the zigzag decoration looks nothing lke herring-bone and the little circles are either mere decoration or some feature of the  construction of the tomb and its lid.3) The pictures of the Manylion are quite specific and show a smallish cloth with fringes round the sides and a diamond pattern of dots connected with lines. This seems to have been a popular pattern – Pam shows a lectern covered with it as well. However it looks nothing like herring-bone, and I do not agree that it is an artistic representation of it. If anything it argues against the Mandilion being the Shroud.4) Pam implicitly wonders if the long purple cloth that accompanies the letter, the Mandilion and its box in various illustrations could be a reference to the Shroud. I think not, as it is found just about everywhere when a functionary carried something important. It is not impossible that the length of cloth used to carry something reflected its importance, which would give some kind of relevance to the term tetradiplon. 5) The ‘Varangian’ guard illustration shows a man, probably an Emperor, being carried by his arms and legs.

I agree that some aspects of the Pray manuscript do not appear to have contemporary parallels. However that does not necessarily relate it to the Shroud. In common with lots of similar scenes, it shows a rectangular box, an awkwardly placed lid, an angel posed on the lid, and a crumpled cloth. There are so many of these that to suppose the Pray manuscript shows something different requires a leap of imagination that I am not prepared to take. Max’s idea that the rectangular shapes are indeed the tomb, but with symbolic representations of its contents, make better sense.I do not think I have seen another picture of a sepulchre covered in crosses, although there are examples of scuptured ones, but it became a decorative feature of Byzantine textiles – specifically priestly garments – in the 11th century. The pattern seems to indicate ‘priestly contents’, as it were, and would apply just as well to a tomb containing a ‘priest.’ It need not indicate the shroud.Most of the similar tomb scenes show one side and one end of the tomb. The end wall mostly angles upwards, but in some cases only the top edge is angled and the bottom edge is as horizontal as the side wall. It’s a bit of an artistic challenge. This painting shows a very similar shape to the Pray picture (http://www.journeywithjesus.net/Essays/20090406JJ.shtml) and I think the diagonal line of crosses on the Pray picture may be meant to indicate the corner of the tomb.","date":"June 17, 2014 at 12:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/12/navy-seals-at-the-battle-of-gettysburg-a-picture-of-the-shroud-in-1036/","cat":"art","title":"Navy Seals at the Battle of Gettysburg?

There is absolutely no tradition of a stiff shroud replacing the oddly placed lid (although either the lid or the shroud or both are occasionally omitted altogether). Jesus himself is an occasional invisible presence (we can see him, though), and guards, either asleep or in panic, are an option.The decoration of the tomb is highly variable, and the decoration of the lid is often different from that of the tomb itself.

There do seem to be some references to the Trinity, which I think have more to do with the letter’s third position in the alphabet rather than the number of points. Pictorially, a delta is far more frequently found as a reference to the Trinity. Overall, it seems to me, the gammadion nearly always refers to an L shape with equal length arms, often four at a time, either with their ends touching, forming a svastika, or with their angles almost meeting at the centre of a cross, which may be upright or diagonal.Ecclesiastically, the chief examples seem to be found in a single church, in Ravenna, where they are found in conjunction with Ns, Zs, Is, Hs, Rs and various other symbols adorning the the togas of holy people. It is not obvious that the gamma has any special significance of its own. In modern times, the gamma as a corner-shape is often found in conjunction with the polystaurion worn by Byzantine clerics, where it may be a fortuitous reference to the Trinity.As for why the ‘poker-holes’ weren’t repaired, was this because there was simply no need, as they have well-defined edges, so not in danger of fraying.

If the image on the shroud was thought of as a painting, then the side wound is on the left and the footprint is a left foot, so the right foot is on top. If the shroud is thought of as a mirror-transfer, then it is the other way round. Post 13th century crucifixes almost invariably (according to OK’s research) have a right side spear-wound and a right foot atop. Contrary to what OK suggests, I think the position of the side-wound should be considered prime, in that it could not have changed between crucifixion and enshroudment. The feet, of course, could have been placed differently after Christ was taken down from the cross. I don’t agree that a miraculous image taken directly from the saviour was considered less truthful than a vague metaphorical Old Testament reference. Not unless the artists knew that the shroud was not a miraculous image but a human painting.However, the uncertainty leads to an interesting dichotomy. If artists followed the 1st century shroud, then they almost uniformly got some major aspects of it wrong (foot and palm nails, for example) – but if the 13th shroud followed earlier artists, then its author worked in distinct opposition to what was to become the norm. As usual, I guess, we’ll all have to keep our own counsel.As I work in a Catholic school, we have a number of crucifixes around the house. Although they all have the wound in the right side, about 25% have left feet atop. I would like to suppose that although earlier crucifixes were not derived from the shroud at all, as most people considered it unlikely to be genuine, the publicity given it since the turn of the 20th century means that increasingly, modern crucifixes have been based on it.

Phoenix dactylifera and Olea europaea, (the date palm and olive tree) are prolific wind-blown pollinators, so it is strange that Frei did not identify any pollen at all from them, nor from either Anthemis bornmuelleri or Matricaria recutita, whose flowers are identified as clustered thickly around the head. Neither of these plants is found near Jerusalem anyway.Spines of Rhamnus lycioides, Gundelia tournefortii and Ziziphus spina-christi are suggested, implying that the crown of thorns was a most elaborate affair carefully composed of strands of three different bushes. Max Frei only identified pollen from Gundelia, although the other two also flower at the same time.Finally, Danin considers Zygophyllum dumosum as a particularly indicative plant (and its pollen was identified by Frei), which would be more convincing if the plant grew in Jerusalem, which it doesn’t.Looked at as a whole, the whole plant identification issue looks more like a cross between pareidolia and simple wishful thinking than any systematic analysis.","date":"January 8, 2014 at 10:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/27/pareidolia-again/","cat":"art","title":"Pareidolia Again"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m told by some people that if you look closely at Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, you can make out what appear to be the faces of 13 people above coloured blobs that, viewed in the correct light, look almost as if they resemble bodies around a dining table.

OK has demonstrated, quite succesfully, that the Pray manuscript is probably unique in many ways; he has not in any way demonstrated that it is derived from the Shroud. Speculations such as the probability of finding wavy lines, or zigzag patterns, or even patterns of dots, mean absolutely nothing unless he can demonstrate that these must indicate some sort of relationship with the Shroud, which, as the previous blog and comments have shown, is far from accepted. Even the nudity, crossed hands and four fingers, which really are present on the Shroud, are not necessarily derived from it.As usual, he does not see the importance of a control. Let’s take the Giovanni Battista della Rovere painting as a comparison. Below the section of the angels holding the Shroud, we have a section showing the Shroud actually being laid on Jesus.1) The Shroud shows a naked man, the Rovere shows a man with a loin cloth.2) The Shroud shows a man with feet crossed, the Rovere shows them straight.3) The Shroud shows each hand with four fingers, the Rovere shows five.4) The Shroud legs are covered in scourge marks, the Rovere has none.5) The Shroud arms are covered in rivulets of blood, the Rovere arms are not.What are the chances that a painting of the dead Jesus which is “wrong” in all these respects owes anything to the Shroud? Astromomically unlikely, I think anyone would agree. And yet there is a painting of the Shroud on the very same canvas!An attempt to list the similarities between the Pray manuscript man and the Shroud is not worthwhile unless a similar attempt is made to list the differences.1) The Shroud man lay on one end of the cloth, the Pray manuscript has the man in the centre.2) The Shroud man has a big beard, the Pray manuscript man does not.3) The Shroud clearly shows wounds, the Pray manuscript man none.And the similarities the Pray manuscript picture has to similar “Three Marys” scenes.1) What proportion of Three Mary’s scenes show a box-like tomb?2) What proportion of Three Mary’s scenes show an angel sitting on an angular slab?3) What proportion of Three Mary’s scenes show a crumpled Shroud?If you see a Three Mary’s scene containing all these elements, what is the chance that in fact none of them correspond to their conventional significance – that the box is not a box but the bottom of a sheet, that the slab is not a slab but the top of the same sheet, and that the crumpled shroud is a repetition of that same sheet, with wavy lines to represent blood?Chesterbelloc says something interesting: “I don’t know how anyone couldn’t at least wonder about these things, instead of dismissing them out of hand.” Well neither do I. I have wondered, tracked down endless versions of the Three Marys, and attempted to explain the anomalies without trying to hide them or explain them away. I have considered the possible significance of the zigzag pattern, the polystaurion pattern, the line of diagonal crosses and the little holes on the top surface. I have wondered about the design of the shroud crumpled on top, the sharp horizontal line that apears to slice it in two, the little Xs that appear all over it and the wiggly lines at the bottom. I have wondered why the figure of Christ is so unconventionally stubble-bearded and why the shroud he is lying on has a little pleat under his buttocks.

Yes.”No. A figure derived from a supposedly genuine image of Jesus must look a bit like him. Specifically, it must have a full beard and a moustache. If it doesn’t have those fundamental identifying characteristics, it cannot be considered the same man, regardless of the pose or the nudity.B) “May 4 fingers, without thumbs on both hands of Jesus on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.”No. Byzantine pictures often show people with no thumbs, but it was not until I studied David Mo’s selection that I realised how many. A third or so of his images show Jesus, and often others, with no thumbs. If the Pray manuscript may derive from the Shroud, then so may all the other Byzantine people with no thumbs, which is absurd.C) “May cropped Jesus legs on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.”No. For a start we don’t even know if the image is cropped, and for a second the fact that both shroud and feet are cropped does not demonstrate any kind of connection between the Shroud and the Pray image. I consider this very far fetched indeed.D) “May zigzag patern on HPM represent herringbone weave on TS? Yes.”No. I’ve explained why not, and do not need to go into it further.E) “May two red smudges on the rectangle on HPM represent blood belt on TS? Yes.”No. The blood belt on the shroud shows interlacing lines, the Pray lines are alongside each other. It is inconceivable that an artist would represent interlacing lines with parallel ones.F) “May the four L shaped circles on the HPM represent poker holes on TS? Yes.”No. They are not on the Shroud but the Tomb.“Can you prove the opposite, to any of the point A-F? No.”No, nor can I prove that Timothy Linick was not a Soviet spy, or that Jesus wasn’t abducted by aliens. OK is confusing probability with proof.“The crucial question is: what is a chance of finding all those elements at random on a single card of a Codex?” Well the answer is: absolute certainty. Because there is such a page. That is not the crucial question at all. The crucial question is: are the two images sufficiently similar, or do the images contain sufficient similar allusions, to make it likely that one derives from the other, and that they do not both derive from a different common source This is not a matter of mathematical calculation, as the weight of each feature is largely subjective. OK and daveb think the matter conclusive one way, Charles and I think their conclusions are wrong. So it goes.“I am not interested what the artist actually wanted to depict.”That is a pity, because I think the intention of the artist is a fascinating question. Does the polystaurion pattern reflect the Jerusalem staircase? Are the radiating zigzagging semicircles depictions of the marble of the Stone of Unction? Why is the Shroud shown as if it were almost transparent? And what are those little holes on the slab?

Even if the Shroud had been omitted from the Gospels, which I think can be explained in terms of secrecy and uncleanness, I don’t think that, if it had any reliquary importance, it would have been omitted from later Three Marys scenes. Indeed, as I said above, one of the major themes of such scenes would have been the discovery of the relic, which must have been shown rather more explicitly than by a couple of wavy lines and some holes. (By the way, are we not making rather a large assumption in supposing these burns to have pre-dated the Pray manuscript. They may well not have occurred until much later!). OK made the point that, even after the Shroud’s incontestable date of existence, Three Marys scenes still do not show it. The reason for this, I fear, is not that artists felt it detracted from the scene, but that they didn’t think it was there in the first place. I think it most unlikely that an artist believing that the image of Christ was left behind in the tomb after the resurrection, would not include it in any depiction of it. In my experience of medieval relics (minimal), what was important to the faithful was not what it looked like – any old sheet would have done – but its provenance, and artistic renderings of its discovery would abound, rather as all those pictures of nails, crowns of thorns, whipping stones and so on tend to resemble a supposed relic rather than any actual archaeological artifact.Or does this defy logic?","date":"July 2, 2014 at 2:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think daveb is right that epitaphioi may play a significant part in the Shroud story.

There are various reasons why the Shroud was not mentioned in the Gospels, which could have been for reasons of uncleanliness, secrecy, or, indeed, because there was no image on it then. However, after the Shroud was known to have an image on it, that’s when I think it unlikely not to have been depicted as such. I think it unlikely that an artist would have assumed that the image was not contemporaneous with the resurrection (how could he have known?), and do not agree that the Byzantines were shy to depict their relics – the Mandylion was widely illustrated.Rabid, now. Another for the thesaurus. I’m sorry that you have decided to class me as rabid. I wonder if you, or OK or Louis, can accept that there could possibly be such a thing as a non-rabid non-authenticist.

The iconography of the Three Marys very rarely has anything that looks as if it was carved out of rock – a cave. The earlier ones show the tomb as a building, sometimes just a big doorway, which I suppose could be interpreted as the built-up entrance to a cave, but mostly they seem to be round temple-like buildings, complete with domed roofs, and seem to me to be derived from the Holy Sepulchre rotunda in Jerusalem. The angel is often sitting on a squarish stone – very rarely a round one – which has sometimes been ‘turned’ to an odd angle. The modern concept of a round millwheel-like stone rolling away from a hole in the hillside is wholly foreign to these pictures. If the stone the angel is sitting on is not the entrance to the tomb, then it is probably modelled, as Carlos suggests, on the Stone of Unction.Later there comes a transition stage in which the building is still there, but a rectangular sarcophagus is also illustrated, and later still the building goes completely and the the angel’s stone becomes the lid of the sarcophagus. This transition and one or two variations of it are very clearly evident if one prints out all David Mo’s, and Carlos’s examples. The architectural elements of the Pray manuscript fit very well into the tradition. The building has gone, the sarcophagus (the polystaurion block) remains, and the skewed ‘lid’ could be either the stone of Unction or the lid of the sarcophagus.

The likes of me can indeed get our heads around the various departures from decorative convention, but there is really very little departure from archaeological convention.Throughout this saga, the sceptics have explained carefully with numerous examples why they do not believe that the Pray drawing demonstrates the pre-existence of the shroud. They have countered with dozens of similar scenes, with discussions of possible alternatives and with thoughtful suggestions as to further possible research. They have demonstrated that a large proportion of Three Marys scenes show a skewed slab over a rectagular sarcophagus, a crumpled shroud and an angel balancing like a surfer on the slab. They have pondered the meaning of the concentric zigzag ‘circles’ and the polystaurion block. They have suggested comparisons with marble and the crusader crosses. They have differed over possible explanations for the various little circles. They have researched possible connections with epitaphioi. They are not immune to the significance of the Shroud as an important Christian icon. They do not insist that authenticists instantly change their minds, but it would be nice if they could at least see some validity to their observations.Is any of this untrue?The response of those who believe that the Pray manuscript does derive from the Shroud, that the Shroud is truly the burial cloth of Christ, has been an unceasing tirade of invective and abuse. They have offered nothing new in the way of evidence, and demanded slavish acceptance of their point of view. Is any of this untrue?You think a series of concentric zigzag semicircles represent herringbone weave. I disagree. I understand your point of view, you think I’m a moron. You think the rectangular slab has sufficiently wavy edges to be considered representative of a cloth rather than a stone. I disagree. I understand your point of view; you think I’m blind.

There are a few of the early “temple-type” Three Marys scenes in which the angel is standing on a very flat slab lying on the floor. In these few I think the slab is being interpreted as the door. In many more he is sitting on a more substantial block, which I think indicates the Stone of Unction which sits outside the sepulchre even today. The later “sarcophagus-type” Three Marys scenes clearly show the angel-slab as the lid of the sarcophagus. In intermediate types the angel-slab is not so clearly a lid (the Pray manuscript being one such), but it is skewed, which I have interpreted either as the lid or the door of the tomb being “rolled away,” but could represent the Stone of Unction being thrown over by an earthquake, as daveb suggests.","date":"July 6, 2014 at 3:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“The gospel records that the tomb was sealed by a rock and there is no mention of a door.” This is, of course, true, but the iconography of the Three Marys scenes does not derive directly from the gospels. The earliest versions, as I have described, do not show a cave sealed by a rock. They show a building, with a doorway. Occasionally the thing the angel is sitting or standing on looks like the door which might have stood in the doorway, and more often it looks like a big stone outside. It is often shown skewed, which may be a reference to the earthquake. The thing the angel sits on, and the thing associated with the tomb (first the temple alone, then the temple and included block or sarcophagus, then the temple with the block or sarcophagus outside, then the block or sarcophagus by itself) are the only two consistent architectural elements of the scene. The other elements are the angel or angels, the women, and the shroud. Very occasionally one or more of these elements is omitted, but where they are included, they are prominent. It is inconceivable that the angel-block would ever be reduced to a couple of lines.

Sadly I’m not persuaded to change my mind, and quoting lists of possible ‘logical faults’ doesn’t help. Over the last few comments, i have outlined the development of the Three Marys icon. The subject is not an individual whim; most religious pictures illustrate particular, often well known gospel incidents, and cannot be considered in isolation from their pictorial forebears. Any picture, or sculpture, of the Crucifixion, the Deposition, the Lamentation, the Anointing, the Resurrection, the Three Marys, the ‘Noli Me Tangere,’ and many others, is to some extent derivative from what has gone before, and the Pray manuscript does not, to me, appear to be an exception.Of course, an image cannot be considered to belong to a class of images unless there are some generalisations which connect it to its genre. These are not sweeping generalisations or logical faults, they are the constituents which determine the nature of the image. We see that the Three Marys (or Quem Quaeritis) image has several fundamental constituents, which are common to the vast majority of the individual members of the class. There are at least three women, and at least one angel, and an angel-block and a tomb-block, and a shroud. Where these can be observed, then that is what they are. Occasionally one or two of the constituents are omitted, but where they are present, they are important parts of the composition. The Pray painting shows all of them. It is not therefore a sweeping generalisation to assume that the artist was depicting them. It would be a bold leap of fancy to suggest that one of the major constituents of the icon had been omitted or marginalised, and then replaced with something very similar which actually represented something else.If these arguments are faulty, then I would be grateful if someone could point out where, with appropriate references, as I have done, rather than simply re-iterate opinions I disagree with.","date":"July 6, 2014 at 9:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Oh dear, this sounds very like the Vignon markings discussion all over again.

In particular, the rectangular element usually placed at a ridiculously odd angle across the sarcophagus may have begun life as the door of a temple, the blocking stone of the tomb or the anointing stone before taking up its familiar job as the lid of the coffin itself. Often it is sufficiently indistinct to suggest several interpretations at once.

Anyone unfamiliar with the gospel narratives could have no idea why it was there.And finally, why is the slab often at such an absurd angle?

The Pray manuscript is an intermediate form, when the precise designations of the two slabs were often indistinct.I’ve no idea what any original rock or stone might have been. The gospels stay “stone” so a stone was drawn. A stone shaped a bit like an altar might actually have been there (many are drawn with a larger surface area on top than at base and trapezoidal sides), and it may have been replaced by the current stone, which is rectangular but I dont know how thick (It seems to be 60cm or so, but it might just be a thin slab lying on somerhing). I have called these slabs the “Stone of Unction” more for ease of nomenclature than because I thought they were actually used for annointing.

Earlier versions’ tombs are always depicted as buildings of some kind, and the angel is usually sitting on a stone outside. Later on, the building becomes a horizontal sarcophagus, and is nearly always clearly outside, not in a building or a cave. There are a few paintings which show both the vertical building and the horizontal sarcophagus, but not many. The angel is usually sitting or standing on or posed by a very oddly angled slab, which I think is artistically and culturally derived from the stone he sat on in the earlier versions. Very rarely, but occasionally, there are angels actually sitting or standing in the sarcophagus.Possibly the key to the odd stone is in the word “revolvere” which is now almost universally translated as “roll.” In fact, any kind of stone that could be rolled is extremely rare in these medieval representations. The big mill-wheel thing that we have become used to is virtually unknown. It would perhaps be better to think of it as meaning “turn away” (there is certainly a turning element to it), which might account for stones swivelled horizontally across the tomb, which occurs quite often, or hinged upwards on end, which also occurs, or just twisted into any weird angle, which is common too.","date":"June 22, 2014 at 5:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hold hard, Skeptic. Stiff upper lip and turn the other cheek and all that. Although you will find that 90% or more of the personal abuse on this site is directed from authenticists to non-authenticists (and sometimes to themselves), we damage our reputation by stooping to their level. I’m certain that OK and Nabber are pillars of their communities, and if they lack the cold unemotional rigour of non-authenticist analysis, perhaps they are more fun to be with at a party.It may be instructive to explore why this one way abuse should be the case. We must remember that most authenticists begin with a belief and work from there to the evidence, whereas most non-authenticists begin with the evidence and work from there to determine the truth. This is not invariably true – Barrie Schwortz and Ray Rogers are shining examples of those who came to their convictions from the evidence, and (beg pardon if I malign him) I think Joe Nickell was convinced the Shroud was a fake long before he investigated it in any depth.But being generally so, I think it the case that authenticists have convictions, whereas non-authenticists have conclusions, and it is more emotionally upsetting to have one’s convictions challenged than one’s conclusions. This is why authenticists are more passionate, less logical, and more abusive. My advice is to forgive them; they know not what they do.Nor must we deny that there are peculiarities in the Pray Codex pictures which we cannot explain. The stepped pyramids (yes, alright, ‘circles’ was an oversimplification) and the polystaurion tomb are reasonably enough derived from Constantine’s Holy Sepulchre, but the three diagonal crosses are anomalous and were clearly not a mistake. They mean something, and so do the little circles which accompany them. Just because we reject their identity with features on the Shroud does not mean that we can ignore them altogether.","date":"March 7, 2015 at 11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think your explanation is ingenious, Thibault, and respect it.

Date 1181.These three are particularly contemporary with the Pray pictures, but then Google variations on Byzantine, Romanesque, Entombment, Resurrection and Three Marys, and you begin to get a feel for what the Pray artist was trying to be part of. In particular, the box-like tomb, with holes or depressions in it, the absurd angle of the lid of the tomb, the perched angel, holding a very thin wand, the abandoned grave-cloths and so on. It then becomes impossible to suppose that the rectilinear features of the Pray pictures are anything other than the tomb, zig-zags, crosses, “poker holes” or whatever.","date":"September 7, 2013 at 2:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I feel the credibility gap increasing here.There are a number of roughly contemporary depictions of the shroud showing large quantities of extra cloth held in the hands of an attendant at the head of the dead Christ. In every single such case that I have seen, similarly large quantities of extra cloth are also held in the hands of another attendant at his feet. As it happens, I don’t think the Pray codex shows this, but if it, as Matthias says “extends up under the halo to the bearded bloke on the left,” then he must agree that it also extends up under the halo of the bearded bloke on the right. In other words, these illustrations place the dead body right in the middle of the shroud.Next, I think the attempt to explain away the absence of pattern on the top shroud, and the concomitant attempt to identify the zig-zag pattern on the sharply cornered rectilinear coffin lid as the weave is becoming more and more desperate. “The two images are entirely different in a stylistic sense, so it makes little sense to compare one with the other,” says Matthias. This is patently untrue. Both images are entirely consistent with dozens of contemporary illustrations of the scenes they depict, and appear, together, in almost exactly the same format, in one of the illustrations I quoted above. Cloth, in both illustrations, looks like cloth, and rigid stuff, in both illustrations, looks like rigid stuff.The two illustrations “might have even been drawn by different artists!” No. Absolutely no.“Is the blood-like spot above the right eye in the Pray Manuscript and similar marks in the hair – reminiscent of the Shroud – just another strange coincidence?” Yes. And not that strange. And it’s not a blood-like spot. If the wiggly lines bordering the cloth underneath are blood, then the spot above the eye should be red. What is strange is that the bushy moustache and prominent bifurcate beard are conspicuously absent.And, no thumb. It has been noticed before that the anointing father also has no thumb, but I ask you to look closely at the angel below. The pointing hand also has no thumb, but it does have five other fingers! And the hand holding the staff only has three fingers. Then there’s the man above with the curly hair, scratching his cheek. How many fingers has he got?However, I grant you, as I did before, the wiggly red lines, the ‘X’s on the wrinkled cloth, and the two groups of holes.

If the cloth follows the contour of the hands, or if the hands and cloth are in the same plane, then the absolute measurements are valid. If the hands are in one plane, and the cloth in another, then either a) The measurements are shorter than real life if the ‘radiation’ is perpendicular to the cloth or b) The measurements are longer than real life if the radiation is perpendicular to the hand.But by how much? To increase any of these measurements by a single millimetre requires that the cloth be in contact at one end and about 10mm higher than the cloth at the other end. This is wholly impracticable.

There are holes in Charles’s arguments, as I have clearly pointed out above, but there are also coherent pieces which cannot be swept aside with the holes. That the Shroud today is not exactly as it always has been is surely not in doubt. Most of each bloodstain has disappeared, leaving only a few flakes jammed in the interstices of the threads, and the entire cloth has yellowed with age, possibly reducing the contrast. That is not to say that it was once a full colour painting of a dead man covered in blood, and I agree that the Lier copy (even though that too has no doubt deteriorated in detail) is probably a fair illustration of the Shroud as it ever was.However, as Charles, points out, engraver after engraver produced images of the shroud which, although very similar to each other, are nothing like the Shroud as we know it. Unless extensive repainting and unpainting is invoked, it is difficult to explain why. The particular aspect that intrigues me is that the feet are usually seen widely separated and pointing outwards, whereas the Shroud has them close together (overlapping) and pointing inwards.In this instance, it does not matter whether the Shroud is authentic or medieval. Here are two styles of copy; they are very different; they both need explaining. I don’t think this is being either cute nor a smart ass.

Charles is certainly correct that most of the pictures of ostentations, of all ages, are clearly defined full length portraits, and his critics are certainly correct that most of the actual copies of the shroud, of all ages, are as faint or nearly so as the Shroud itself. (Carlos’s picture above being a notable exception) The problem is to reconcile these two different styles of representation. There are several approaches, technical and cultural.Firstly, almost all the illustrations of ostentations in Beldon Scott are of engravings or woodcuts or prints, which do not lend themselves to indistinct representations of anything, while the copies in cloth mentioned above are paintings, which can be as faint as you like.Secondly, on those rare occasions when colour appears, it is invariably monochrome. Of course an engraving could hardly be anything else, but the della Rovere paintings show a monochrome image, and a poster for the 1684 exposition, which is mostly engraved but had a woodblock insert just for the images, has that wood block print in sepia.Thirdly, the USP power of the Turin Shroud was that it held the two-fold image of Christ, not that it was just longer than its rivals in France, nor even that it had blood on it. Even if the pilgrims who came to see it never actually got close enough to observe it directly, they could buy a souvenir showing what they would have seen if they had had the chance.Fourthly, as I have argued above, if the Shroud was originally made for a Quem Quaeritis ceremony then it was essential (as OK picked out) that it was not a painting of Christ lying in his shroud, but a representation of what he might have left behind. This makes more sense to me than a forged miracle, when in general the more “miraculous” it looked the better.  Fifthly, by the time the shroud reached Chambery, let alone Turin, it had ceased to have any connotations of ‘realism’, and had become a ‘my relic is more magnificent than your relic’ status symbol, so advertisments, before or after, of ostentations not only showed a more magnificent representation of the shroud image, but also the magnificence of the management of it, with dozens of clerics and soldiers in serried ranks. There is an interesting comparison to be made between the Tempesta engraving of 1613 and the Bolkmann painting of 1686. Both are crammed with the same sort of people, but the impression in the earlier one is of chaotic enthusiasm, with soldiers rather vainly squashed up against the ostentation dais as the populace crush forwards, while in the Bolkmann, there is very clear military order, the crowds being firmly kept in place behind regiments of cavalry. In the first, the image on the Shroud is very visible, in the second, wholly hidden behind a silk cover.I’m interested in Bolckmann. He is wholly unknown to the internet other than for this one painting, which is described by Beldon Scott as “a unique visual document recording with remarkable accuracy the appearance of one of these events.” However, I’m not sure I agree with Beldon Scott’s rationale for his painting “the climactic moment when the attending bishops pull back the red silk covering.” I don’t think it had anything to do with the moment. I think the reason his painting doesn’t show any more than the bottom few inches of the shroud under its red silk covering was because he was honest enough to know that there was actually almost nothing to see, and that from the viewpoint of the painting it would have been a blank white sheet.","date":"January 24, 2015 at 5:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"But Charles does have a point.

I believe nowadays there is a reproduction of the Shroud hanging above the altar in which it lies, for just such people to see. That statue perhaps had all the characteristics we see in the engravings, separates feet, loincloth, crown of thorns or whatever, and the engravers then copied that onto their pictures, even though they knew that the real thing was nothing like it.

I have tried to see both points of view, but cannot help finding the engravings easier to ‘explain away’ than the paintings. Rather like souvenir postcards of Roman ruins, they were created to show what was ‘meant’ to be there rather than what actually was there. I have only heard a couple of arguments the other way – one that the faint paintings were as bright as the Shroud but they too have faded with age, and the other that they were copies of something else. Neither of them ring true with me. Charles is quite correct that we ought to try to imagine what the Shroud was like when it was first created, and no doubt the cloth has yellowed and the blood largely rubbed off, but the earliest Ab Originale copies are too similar to its present appearance for me to think it was very different.However, I do not see that having a fainter appearance detracts from Charles’s Quem Quaeritis hypothesis at all, quite the reverse; it strengthens it, as I have explained above.","date":"January 24, 2015 at 12:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"}],"blood":[{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“This fits the bodily Resurrection of Jesus Christ.” I’m not quite sure what anoxie is saying.

Barbet, I am sure, had he been pressed to say what the cause was of the distinctive colour, would have been happy with a vague hope that under some circumstances blood can stay red for longer than ‘normal.’ Subsequent investigation has yet to demonstrate that that is the case for blood which is hundreds of years old.","date":"May 29, 2013 at 10:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Not bilirubin.

Other ‘scientists’ have suggested Marfan’s Syndrome and multiple endocrine neoplasia, both of which have been discredited by other ‘scientists.’As almost all adults with Klinefelter’s Syndrome look no different from any other adult, it is difficult to say categorically that any historical figure didn’t have it, but the figure on the shroud does not, in my opinion, show the enlarged breasts that occur in a few percent of cases, nor the nipples which would accompany them, and whether, or by how much, his overall proportions differ from those of ordinary people has been the subject of endless inconclusive debate.As for the alleged discoveries of Ron Wyatt, not only do these remain unproven, but there is no evidence at all that he discovered any blood on any ark down any crack under any crucifixion-cross-socket.

The geology of the entire area has been extensively studied and none of it demonstrates any extreme volcanic activity (although a fair amount of seismic activity is clear).

All his photos of “crystals of sulphur” are actually “desert roses” of gypsum. Pure sulphur balls are not exclusive to the Dead Sea but relatively common in similar conditions across the globe and may be caused either microbiologically or due (more likely in this case) to the reduction of gypsum by hydrocarbons.

Notice the steep absorption trough at 700nm, followed by an equally steep rise. This is very different from the Gilberts’ spectrum, which continues to drop towards 750nm.If we compare the Gilberts’ spectrum, from 0nm to 759nm, to the spectrum of methemoglobin over the same range, the conclusion that the two are the same cannot, in my opinion, be sustained, even allowing for convenient hypothesised distortion due to age.I do take Kelly’s point about other old blood. Sadly, although blood seems to have been found on Aztec sacrificial knives, Utzi the Iceman, and on paleolithic stone tools I cannot find a spectral analysis of it.

The first was rubbing with dry powder. This produced a good image with the requisite 3-D and negative characteristics, but was a flop microscopically, as it depended entirely on the powder, which easily washed off, leaving an unmarked cloth. The second was rubbing with a dry powder mixed with 1% sulphuric acid into a paste. The powder washed off, as before, and the acid left a superficial degradation of the cloth which was enhanced by heating. However the marks produced by this method lacked the 3-D and negative quality of the Shroud. It is not clear to me the proportions in which the powder and the acid were combined (pastes can be thick or thin), and think that further investigation of this method, using different thicknesses of paste, would be worth carrying out.Piero, the “bioplastic coating hypothesis” of Leoncio Garza-Valdez was largely discredited when it was recognised that the coating would have to be twice the weight of the shroud itself in order to affect a 1st century cloth so much that it appeared 13th century when carbondated. It suffered more when some supposed filamentous bacteria pointed out by Garza-Valdez were reclassified as ultimate threads from the linen fibrils, and more still when it was realised that bacteria and fungi are heterotrophic and, since all their carbon would be derived from what they ate (the shroud), the radiocarbon date would not be affected by them anyway. However it is not impossible that some bacterial contamination of the shroud may have affected its chemical composition.","date":"December 18, 2013 at 2:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks, Jos.

I simply cannot agree that the absorbance spectrum obtained by the Gilberts correlates to the spectra obtained by Cameron and George (1969), or Afromowitz and Callis (1992), or any of the others one can find on the internet.The spectrum of methemoglobin is characterised by three distinct peaks, at 400nm, 500nm and 630nm. Only two of these are shown on the Cameron and George diagram (500nm and 630nm), and also, albeit oddly shifted, on the Afromowitz and Callis diagram (520nm and 650nm). The Gilberts’ Shroud spectrum not only does not have a peak at 630nm, nor a peak at 500nm, but most importantly of all no peak at all at 400nm. This is wholly characterisitic of all types of hemoglobin, and it’s missing.

No other part of the bloodstain has a visible serum fringe. None of the scourge marks on the dorsal image has a serum fringe, nor the rivulets of blood across the back, and if the marks of the crown of thorns have any, they are very faint indeed. None of the bloodstains on the front of the head (including the famous epsilon) show any fringe at all. The spear wound has a slight border on its top and top left ‘shoulder’ only. The wrist wound has a nice little halo around the upper ‘finger,’ but nowhere else, and the arm rivulets have no halo at all.It is not impossible that this might be explained by the stains of the foot-wound, spear-wound and wrist-wound being derived from reopened injuries, while the rest were derived from the remoistening of dried blood.","date":"April 8, 2013 at 6:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Has anybody read “Age estimation of blood stains by hemoglobin derivative determination using reflectance spectroscopy” by Bremmer et al., in Forensic Science International, Volume 206, Issues 1–3, 20 March 2011, Pages 166–171?I thought not, otherwise it would surely have been mentioned bv someone. An abstract and its diagrams can be found by Googling, and there is a slideshow resume at http://www.slideshare.net/rolfok/ageing-bloodstains.In it we can find four simple reflectance spectra of blood at four different ages (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 63 days), which can be compared to the Gilberts’ reflectance spectra from the shroud, which can be found at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers5faqs.pdf, with the proviso that the Gilbert’s blood spectrum is an average of, I think, four different stains and may not exactly represent any particular one.The “Redness” of a stain appears to be related to a steep rise in reflectance between 500nm and 600nm, the closer to 600nm the better. The Gilberts’ bloodstain spectrum shows the steep rise, but it begins at about 520nm, and would probably be better described by ‘orange’ rather than ‘red.’ Maybe I should give Billy Reuben another chance, although it could be argued that the Gilberts’ spectrum is sufficiently different from any of Bremmers as to suggest that the shroud stains are not in fact blood at all.“Brown-ness” seems to be indicated by a steady and gradual rise in reflectance from about 500nm to about 800nm. This pattern is followed by Bremmer’s 63-day old blood, and also by the Gilberts’ “image” spectrum.All in all the contrast between these two sets of spectra seems to me to warrant all the discussion that has so far appeared on this blog, and probably a great deal more!","date":"April 9, 2013 at 7:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The areas scanned were 6mm x 3mm, so I think were representative of each blood area decided upon. To confirm this, each individual spectrum has roughly the same shape, it is merely higher or lower up the y-axis, indicating that the blood is all the same colour, just lighter or darker according to various factors, such as intensity of application or subsequent erosion. Surprisingly, the foot area tested was the brightest, followed by the forehead and wrist more or less the same, and the lance being the darkest. As I would have said the foot area represents quite a deep stain, this suggests that any particular gross stain area could have quite a variation of intensity.Interestingly, the average spectrum is listed as being taken from: wrist-F3E, side-F6B, forehead-F8C, and back-B3C, while the individual spectra are listed as: wrist-F3E, lance-F6B, forehead-F8C and foot-B1A. Why one diagram includes the foot and the other includes the back is not explained.Since there is overall consistency in the shape of all the individual spectra, we are entitled to ask for an explanation for a distinct spike at about 610nm on all four bloodstains, which does not correspond with any kind of blood. It could be from the addition of a red pigment to touch them up, I guess, although materials such as iron oxide or vermilion don’t have such pronounced peaks in their spectra.","date":"April 10, 2013 at 5:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Sorry, Colin, I should have continued to make it clear.

The type of blood, its brightness, substrate or its age produce variations on the theme, but the general description above appears to apply to it all.The shroud stains, by Pellcori’s own admission, exhibit none of these characteristics except the steep 600nm-700nm slope. And they do have that most uncharacteristic reflectance peak (absorption dip) at 600nm. Neverthless, Pellicori concludes that “there is, however, sufficient correlation in the spectrophotometry to decide that the material on the shroud is blood.” He reinforces his conclusion by saying that “the resemblance to blood as seen in the photomicrography in these areas is strong.” He finally decides that the shroud spectrum “suggests denatured met-hemoglobin” to which all I can say is; not to me, it doesn’t.","date":"April 11, 2013 at 6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’ve been Googling… Enter “Charles I” and “Vest”, and you will be presented with an array of photos of a garment held at the Museum of London, reputedly worn by King Charles I at his execution (1649), and reputedly stained with his blood.

Some have said that the blood looks “fresh” as if the redness were witness to a miracle, or to a pathological state (not as yet demonstrated), and others say that the redness is merely witness to the blood not being blood at all, but paint. Some say that the blood could have been real blood, but given its freshness with a bit of paint on top.Some observers suggest that the blood looks pinker in daylight than it does inside, which may be due to the different spectra of the illumination, or due to fluorescence derived from the sunlight, not achievable using artificial light. Miller and Pellicori’s fluorecence tests do not confirm this suggestion. My own observations on Shroud 2.0 are that the blood does look too pink to be nothing but blood, regardless of any speculations about bilirubin, methemoglobin etc. But then, it also looks too pink to be iron oxide. It does look like red madder.The identification of blood rests largely on Heller and Adler’s positive tests for porphyrins, both chemically and spectroscopically, and also bilidenes, via a conventional test kit. It has been pointed out that porphyrins are present in other materials such as chlorophyll and urine, but the field is definitely narrowed to a fairly small range of possibilities, including actual blood.","date":"May 27, 2015 at 7:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/27/colin-berry-is-not-seeing-red/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Colin Berry is not Seeing Red"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thought for tomorrow.

However, it is directly contradicted by a number of books whose authors claim that the reverse was the case. Jewish coins were only permitted to be of bronze or copper (and were all aniconic), and only silver coins were allowed in the temple. Tyrian coins fitted the bill, as they were not minted by Romans directly, and had a high and stable silver content. The money changers therefore changed Jewish bronze coins into Tyrian silver ones, not the other way round. Curiously, perhaps, Tyrian coins were not aniconic at all, but apparently gave no offence.Similarly, there seems considerable dispute about the archaeological evidence for coins in Jewish burials. Jason’s Tomb (excavated by Prof. Rahmani in 1967), as mentioned by Max above, was indeed littered with coins, and Prof. Rahmani’s categorical statement from 1980: “No coins of the period 50 BC to 70 AD were found in any tomb,” is a curious contradiction.

Remember the ‘burning’ is on the cloth, not the body. Start, as you suggest, with the body on its back enveloped in the shroud. Which image is formed, the one below or the one above? Let’s say the one above, by radiation upwards from the body. The layer below the body is unmarked.Now the body turns over without disturbing the cloth. Which image is formed now? If radiation upwards is still the mechanism, then an image of the back of the body is superimposed on the one of the front which is already there. If the radiation is now downwards, then a second image of the front of the body is formed on the cloth below the body, and we would end with two frontal images, not one frontal and one dorsal.The body lay in the shroud for a maximum time of about 36 hours; “three days” only includes a few hours of Friday afternoon and a few hours of Sunday morning.As for the “surely Jesus could defy science” idea, this is, of course, true.

Do I count as an elder statesman? I’m flattered!Anyway, I do have problems with all these measurements, as in spite of being told that the shroud has a resolution of half a centimetre or so, it is really very difficult to decide where exactly we are measuring from and to. Your own “the middle of the back of the head or probably a bit higher” is as good as one can get, in most cases, and it’s not at all obvious where that is.Even on ones own head, the middle of the back of it is pretty difficult to define, so I’m going for a little bump called the inion, which is different for everybody, but on my head is a well defined little bump on the back of my skull. My other point of reference will be the space between my eyebrows. This distance is about 35cm, although different heads will no doubt vary by a centimetre or two. The question is, where is the inion on the shroud? If I use shroudscope to measure 35cm from the space between the eyebrows I reach aproximately the upper edges of the ring of blood trickles, where, one might suppose, the thorns of the crown jammed against the skull. If I measure to the lower edges of the trickles – another 4cm or so, then I am assuming that the ring of piercings was much higher up the crown of the head, and, perhaps oddly, that no blood flowed down the hair below the inion, which seems odd. That’s why I think the inion was in the former place, and the eyebrow-inion distance does not admit of a substantial extra flap of cloth between the two heads, although, as I have consistently maintained, it does admit of a bit of separation due to cloths, caps or something similar.","date":"March 11, 2014 at 6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Mike, if you have an online image you’d like referenced, then all you have to do is to provide its URL for us to look it up ourselves (it avoids copyright issues as well).

Although blood in bulk can remain liquid for a while after death, it would not be expected to do a lot more than trickle (albeit copiously!) from, say, a spear wound in the side of the chest. In the case of puncture wounds in living people in general (and obviously I’m thinking specifically of a hand or wrist being fixed to a beam with a nail), how good is the implement at preventing blood loss while it is still in the wound? Those people who volunteer to be crucified every Easter in the Philippines or Mexico do not appear to bleed at all while they are being nailed, or while they are on the cross. I have not seen what happens when the nail is removed – being alive, I can imagine there is some blood loss then. But if the victim were dead, nearly all the blood in the arm would drain by gravitation, no? Also, volunteer crucifixees appear to keep quite still – perhaps the pain of being punctured is minimised like that. They certainly do not flail about or jerk or spasm. They are standing on a platform, so a hanging weight is not a problem, but some are nailed to it, so I can imagine there is a lot of pain in the feet as well as the hands.

It is clear from his letters (at holyshroudguild.org) that he was desperately sorry to conclude that the shroud was a fake, and waited over a year before he revealed his findings. Sadly personality differences rather than scientific ones immediately kicked in, and no collaborative discussion between, say, McCrone and Adler, which might have resulted in compromise, ever took place. I don’t excuse him from responsibility for this – his dismissal of Adler’s results was arrogant and his successive resignations from Sturp were petulant – but it may have been possible to work around him with more diplomacy on Sturp’s part, which could have prevented the years of inconclusive disagreement which eventually ensued.

Anyway, back to the Pray codex. I think the rectangular things are definitely parts of the tomb rather than the shroud, but I do find their markings odd, and have spent some time trying to make sense of them. Overall, the sketch owes a lot to the standard “three Marys” and other resurrection iconography of the medieval period, and has much in common with them. It looks to me, however, as if it is a rather amateur copy of another image that was only half-remembered correctly.For a start, most medieval resurrections show Christ’s tomb as box-like rather than cave-like. This is probably thanks to the emperor Constantine I’s excavations, which carved away almost the entire hillside around the opening to the cave, leaving, indeed, a door into a more or less rectangular stone box. As pilgrims kept chipping bits off it, the whole thing was covered in marble, which may explain the swirly patterns found in some paintings, and possibly the zigzag decoration in the Pray drawing.Secondly, there were apertures in this marble edifice, through which pilgrims could peer through to the tomb itself inside. These are sometimes shown as simple squares or circles, and occasionally as quatrefoils, or cross-shaped with rounded corners. These could have provided the inspiration for the little crosses all over the lower shape in the Pray drawing.Finally, just outside Constantine Monomarchus’s marble-covered tomb, according to François de Chateaubriand’s travel journal, “there is a stone which is a foot and a half square, and is raised a foot, which is of the same rock, and which served to support the large stone that closed off the entrance; it was from this rock that the angel spoke to the two Marys.” Of course by de Chateaubriand’s time the whole church had been destroyed and rebuilt several times, but a flat stone is usually shown in paintings, usually at an extraordinarily steep angle, with the angel perched on it somewhat awkwardly like a surfboarder.A detailed account of the development of the Three Marys design can be found in Neil Conwell Brooks, The Sepulchre of Christ in Art and Liturgy, which can be found on archive.org. He called this design the “Western coffer-tomb type.”","date":"August 26, 2013 at 12:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Ron, perhaps they were a mixture.

I don’t think pressure in itself will produce smudges, if the body is not moved. If the scourge marks are not deep cuts, but contusions or grazes (even if some of the skin has been scoured off), then the surfaces would exude not liquid blood, but, as Zugibe describes it “an oozing of bloody material,” which I take to mean the seepage that you find on a healing wound after pulling off a scab. It could be quite viscous, and it may be the clarity of the marks is because of, not in spite of, the pressure. Zugibe’s wound photos are not particularly relevant here, but his upper photo does not show blood flow, only transfer from the wound to paper towel. I don’t think the scourge wounds would have been as bloody myself. His lower photos are of actual holes, and they are the ones oozing blood.2- If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain that there appeared to be no scourge stain that tend to follow the herringbone weave pattern of the cloth?This depends on the viscosity of the liquid, which depends primarily on its water content. Barbet was, I suppose, dripping fresh blood directly onto a cloth. The Lavoies’ experiments on the transfer of blood from plastic to cloth after half an hour showed remarkably that the blood clots did not spread out at all, unless it was specifically moistened beforehand. Having said that, since the plasma part of the blood is invisible to the naked eye, we do not know that it has not spread out along the fibres by capillary action.3- If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain the presence of distinct halos of serum around much of the scourge marks?I wish you could see Miller and Pellicori’s photos. There are NO “distinct haloes of serum” around the scourge marks. There are some indistinct fluorescent bordering areas, which are entirely consistent with some serum seeping out into the fibres by capillary action.4- If Zugibe’s hypothesis is correct, how can you rationally explain the presence of some precise scourge marks at less than 2 cm of an evident post-mortem blood flow, while you know that it was against Jewish law to remove or disturb such a post-mortem blood and while you also know that if there was a washing, it would have been done rapidly (you even mention in a previous post that the washing was most probably “not done very thoroughly”)?Just for you, I have laid a trail of ketchup on my kitchen table, and then smeared more ketchup onto the table close to it. I can confirm that I can remove the entire smear, without disturbing the original trail, with a few pieces of absorbent paper towel. If there happened to scourge marks under the smear, they would have been exposed by my wiping.","date":"July 30, 2013 at 7:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well, I think we’ve come to a bit of an impasse.

He finds it difficult to understand how, from a body literally matted with blood from head to foot, only a few pre-mortem trickles have managed to transfer images of themselves, very neatly and without smudging or smearing in spite of the handling the body received both pre- and post-mortem. Yannick hopes that some very special circumstance arose in which this was exactly the case. It is, I think, precisely this problem which led Barbet and others to suppose that the body was indeed more or less dry until shortly before being enshrouded, when, by another special circumstance, the dried blood was sufficiently moistened to permit exudations to transfer an exact pattern onto the cloth. The supposed serum rings were, to Barbet, a verification of that, although serum exudes from whole blood as well. The only real finding in favour of the exudation hypothesis is the lack of potassium in the minerals of the ‘blood,’ which Adler attributes, not very convincingly, to the retention of erythrocytes in the body.Yannick dismisses the possibility that the post-washing blood may have been allowed to semi-clot again before the body was enshrouded, which I think is fair. It is clear that Zugibe thinks whole blood, not serum clot retraction exudate, is on the shroud. In that case, says, Barbet, the blood would have seeped outwards across the cloth (by capillary action), and not leave those very neat-edged shapes that in fact we see. I don’t think this is necessarily true. The viscosity of blood seems very variable, as evidenced by the different shapes of the wrist-wound (very slow) and the arm-trickles (very runny).Yannick does not seem to notice that Zugibe differentiates between the blood-flows and the scourge-marks, although, to be fair, the point is not really clearly made. Zugibe says that having washed and re-opened the scourge wounds (which are more like contusions than cuts) there would be “an oozing of bloody material” which I think is intended to be different from a liquid blood flow.The whole subject of exudates, while apparently solving some of the problems with the blood images, is mired in complications which neither Barbet nor Yannick clarify at all well. The fact that they clearly contain a good deal more red colour (hemolysed erythrocytes) than serum is a serious objection, the neat way in which even long-dried trickles suddenly produce neat images of themselves, the attempt to keep the wounds moist by bacterial infection – none of these have any basis in reality. Googling “wound dressing removal” shows what real exudates look like!Finally, I see that I “desperately want to defend at all cost Zugibe’s hypothesis.” Not only is this nonsense, but it illustrates Yannick’s mindset much better than it illustrates mine. Scientists do not desperately defend things, not become so convinced of their own hypotheses that they do not admit of any problem with them that needs refinement. As it stands, the serum clot retraction hypothesis, while possibly useful as an explanation for the scourge wounds, makes little or no sense for the blood-trickles, and is directly refuted by the marks over the purported holes in the wrist, chest and feet, which look nothing like clot retractions at all.","date":"July 29, 2013 at 4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Ho hum, good Ol’ Yannick…First, I want to categorically state this:Pellicori and Miller were certainly not “clear about the fact that almost every single scourge mark on the cloth was showing an halo of clear serum around them.” They present seven photos of the shroud, from Dorsal Foot to Ventral Foot, and comment on the features of each one. No reference is made of fluorescence around the scourge marks is made until the third photo (the back), when they say “Many scourges have fluorescing bordering areas.” That’s all.Next, “almost all the scourge marks are showing the same precise dumbbell-like shape, the same presence of halos of serum around them, the same color, etc.” This is another generalisation clearly not borne out by observation. There are at least two different marks that might be described as dumbbell shaped, and a large proportion of the ‘striated’ kind. The presence and extent of the serum haloes is even more various.Next, Yannick finds an irreconcilable difference between “Barbet, Adler, Lavoie and others” who think that the scourge marks were caused by a transfer of exudates from still moist or remoistened blod clots, and Zugibe, who thinks that the clots were dry and were re-activated by washing. I don’t understand the difference. However, Yannick’s main point is that it is impossible to wash a body with an accuracy finer than 2cm. “How in the world does the person who did this rapid washing (remember that it if the Shroud man is Jesus, this would have been an hasty burial) could have dared to wash the immediate region surrounding the post-mortem blood flow (including the area located at less than 2 cm.” Well, I would. In fact, if I wanted to wipe away an overall smear of blood across the entire back (as we see in those photos of Philippine flagellants), but leave a specific mass of blood in place for religious reasons, I think I could do it with an accuracy of about half a centimetre. Would I use a sponge? Probably not. I’d use damp cloths.“Seriously, does that sound credible and rational to you in the context of a Jewish burial that would have been done in a way to prevent any disturbance of the post-mortem blood that was still present on the corpse because it was considered impure by the Jewish Law? One thing’s for sure: Not for me! This idea of a very precise (almost surgical) washing in this zone is quite simply ludicrous to me.” Well, that’s fine for Yannick, but it seems both possible and perfectly normal to me.“I prefer by far my own hypothesis.” Well that’s fine too, but I don’t think it’s credible. Basically you seem to accept that the image was formed from emanation from the body, through a coating of dried blood, without the blood affecting the image formation. You go to the most elaborate details in trying to find a difference between dried blood on the body, the cloth, the hair and so on, without any evidence that the image shows any such difference.Next, the discovery of a few minute fragments of stone in some parts of the shroud is given as evidence that the body wasn’t washed, whereas it could be equally good evidence, given that so little has been found, that in fact it was washed, but not very thoroughly.Overall, the bloodstains are a complex part of the mystery of the shroud, and I think any explanation for them is likely to be fairly complex itself. Even Occam would have had some difficulty in knowing exactly how to wield his razor. For me though, given the choice, Zugibe beats Clement hands down.","date":"July 28, 2013 at 10:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I don’t think that’s fair to Lavoie.

Cahall. I often wonder who “a reader writes” is, and whether they follow up the ballyhoo their innocent inquiry can stir up! The problem with most of the evidence about the shroud is that what is unquestioned is circumstantial, and what is direct is never unquestioned. The similarities of the image on the shroud to Gospel accounts, Roman descriptions of crucifixion, or medieval paintings place one in a chicken and egg situation, and cannot be considered more than suggestive. Similarly, the fact that “nobody knows how it was done” applies equally to a natural 1st century image and a manufactured 13th century one.The main scientific points (at least to me) are whether the blood arrived before or after the image, the provenance of the pollen, and the radiocarbon date. All of these would be extremely good evidence if any of them were universally accepted, but they’re not. Max Frei’s pollen analysis is statistically very questionable, and his slides have disappeared into purdah, and the blood first hypothesis has been thrown into question mostly by the apparent discovery that the image is not part of the original flax but on some kind of coating – itself a highly disputed hypothesis. The failure of the radiocarbon date depends either on deliberate fraud, which very few people adhere to, or to the fact that the date was affected by more recent contamination, by oils, wax, sweat, bacterial plaque or patching. Sadly for me, none of the evidence of contamination bears much examination, which has tipped me in favour of a medieval provenance for the shroud.I have been both challenged and praised about this recently (depending on the stance of my commenter), as if my medievalist stance were in stark opposition to an authenticists one, but as Dan, Barrie and those others who follow the discussions on this and other blogs will know, the balance between the evidence in favour and the evidence against is extremely delicate. A single photo showing anomalous threads could tip me in the other direction, and a single new medieval find could tip somebody else from authenticist to medieval.","date":"October 17, 2013 at 9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/16/holding-the-shroud-to-an-impossible-standard/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Holding the Shroud to an impossible standard?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks Kelly.

The whitish patches are due to the overexposure of the reflective sheen of true shroud material.However, you may have a point if the yellow threads are coloured thanks to “serum” rather than “image.” They just look the same in photographs. I think if the protease tests had been carried out on threads rather than fibrils, and if, indeed, yellow blood threads had turned white, while yellow image threads remained the same colour, I would find Adler’s findings more convincing.

Riggi’s crucifix provided a slightly different, asymmetrical version in which the two arm positions alternated with each other. So reasonable did this seem that as far as I know nobody has actually tried it out. Or, which is not unlikely, it has been tried out and doesn’t work. This is because it relies on quite a ‘reservoir’ of blood along the top of the arm (your longer arrows) to break into smaller rivulets which drop straight off across the arm as it becomes horizontal (your shorter arrows).It’s a good, sensible, naturalistic BPA explanation for the shape of the blood flows as we see them, and it has satisfied a number of eminent pathologists, but I don’t think it works. Not enough blood to fill the ‘reservoir’, blood pressure too low, nail preventing bleeding, blood either too viscous or too fluid, clotting time too rapid, etc. It would be good to be able to discus these points with someone with appropriate experience such as a forensic anthropologist specialising in violent death.

That’s fair enough. However he also says that: “the blood in the arms would not flow backwards because the flow is  governed by one way valves.” I’m not sure what he means here. Is he saying that the blood would not drain down towards the chest? Surely the one-way valves in the veins of the arm prevent the blood from flowing towards the hand, not towards the chest. After all the veins are taking blood back from the extremities to the heart, the valves allow that.

Although these questions sound flippant, they have direct implications for the appearance of the image on the shroud, and cannot be avoided if we follow ChrisB’s line of thinking. Other resurrection experts have assumed the body simply de-materialised, with or without a burst of energy of one kind or another, the shroud collapsing through the void thus created, and some non-believers think the shroud was simply folded back by the Essenes, who lifted Jesus, alive or dead, away, leaving the cloth behind.","date":"February 20, 2013 at 12:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/19/on-the-topic-of-bloodstains-picking-up-threads-of-useful-discussion/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"On the Topic of Bloodstains: Picking up Threads of Useful Discussion"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"On the whole, my view is that the results of the multitudes of tests carried out on the ‘blood’ do indicate that it is real blood.

This dichotomous view of the shroud – that it can only be either an out and out deliberate fake or the inevitable result of a temporarily wrapped corpse – in my view ignores quite a gamut of intermediate alternatives, including the deliberate enhancement of a genuine relic, a largely accidental result of some experimentation, a replacement for a relic destroyed by fire, a backing cloth for something else, and so on.

That is very hard to believe.” To be frank, this doesn’t ring true, but then, time could have made the memory a little hazy. Alan Adler almost certainly knew very well that there is no a priori difference between pre- and post-mortem blood, and that consequently no differentiating test could have been performed. The blood emerging from a man who bleeds to death on a cloth does not change in composition after his heart ceases to beat, and having emerged, both pre- and post-mortem blood are subject to similar changes. As Helmut mentions above, early blood transfusions were successfully done using blood from dead people.However, some differentiation can be made between the shape of pre- and post-mortem bloodflows on the Shroud, based on the pressure with which it was expressed, and this has been recognised and commented on. The trickles down the arms are most unlikely to have been possible from a dead man, and are generally assumed to have arrived in place while Jesus was still hung on the cross, while the zig-zag ooze from the chest wound seems to be from a simple gravitational process, rather than the copious squirt (sometimes depicted in medieval art) that would have been the result of a beating heart. Other bloodmarks are more ambiguous.I think the author’s suggestion that religious convictions may have led to unfounded conclusions is not, in my opinion, supported by any evidence, and is best set aside in favour of more objective observations. One is tempted to wonder whether the author’s affiliations are reflected in his comments as well. A few pathologists have considered it possible that the image and its bloodstains could only have been caused by a living person, and the point about myrrh being more of a healing unguent than an embalming one is well made.

The distinction is subtle, but it leaves room for others to disagree with his findings, and to come to different conclusions. In particular, I was talking to a young surgeon last week who did not believe that the blood-flow from the chest wound could have come from a body which had been dead for any length of time, based on his own recent experience with traumatic deaths.In addition to this, some of Bucklin’s observations are clearly guesses. His estimate of the height of the man, confidently given as 71″, is not substantiated by the measuring tool on Shroud Scope, and his calculations about the angle of the arms appear to be based simply on the angles between the arms and the bloodflows on them, which are not borne out by experimentation such as Garlaschelli’s. He also notices “a square imprint giving the appearance of an object resting on the skin” on the forehead, and “rounded foreign objects can be noted on the imprint in the area of the right and left eyes.”None of this, of course, ‘proves’ that the eminent pathologist was wrong in his conclusions, but the statement “Dr. Robert Bucklin proved from his surface autopsy that the man on the Shroud was most certainly dead” is unjustified.","date":"August 27, 2015 at 3:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

Louis’ ridiculous comment “I can see that you unfortunately have no courage to comment, although you are editor of the BSTS newsletter” is a feeble attempt to goad me into a discussion about Kashmir, which is nothing to do with the Shroud, or the BSTS, and hasn’t worked.Ron Chism’s website has a section entitled “Did Jesus survive the Cricifixion?” and lists 8 pieces of evidence, some of which have sindonological relevance. Readers are invited by Ron (“recommended” in fact) “to examine each of these in more detail.” Points 1, 2 and 3 are biblical, and do not elucidate the Shroud. Point 4 assumes that crucifixion invariably lasted days rather than hours. Such meagre contemporary evidence that we have cannot justify the word ‘invariably’. If the bible is to be believed, in this particular place at this particular time, crucifixion victims were not left alive over the sabbath anyway, even if they could have lasted much longer, but were definitively killed off by crurifragium or percussio. Point 5 claims that while the crurifragium invariably lead to death, the percussio might leave a victim alive. This is where the Shroud (assuming that it is genuine) may be evidence. For a start it seems that if there were any doubt about whether the victim was alive, the crurifragium was used, so the Roman guards were satisfied that Jesus was indeed dead before they lanced him, and secondly, the wound as it appears on the Shroud appears approximately as wide as the width of a Roman lance, implying more than a surface scratch. Some scholars have suggested that as percutio can refer to being stung by an insect or snake, that perhaps the Roman guard was part of a plot to keep Jesus alive and only scratched him. This is not borne out by the blood image on the Shroud.Point 6 looks at the “blood and water.” This has been interpreted in all sorts of ways. It has been the opinion of some pathologists that a living man stabbed in that manner would have produced copious amounts of blood and pleural fluid, squirting out and spattering both body and any adjacent material until he was dead. A dead man would simply leak the liquid contents of the heart and lungs above the wound. Assuming this is true, then the Shroud supports the second version. Other pathologists claim that only a beating heart could have produced the amount of blood blood flow as seen on the Shroud, including not only the chest wound but the streams across the back, and probably including a lot of other blood which did not mark the Shroud, either because it missed or because it was washed off, so that what remains is the result of the rather feeble heartbeat of a man close to death, but revivable. These pathologists claim that the blood of a dead man becomes too viscous to flow at all within a short time of death, and could not have oozed as claimed by the former group.As far as I know, pathologists of both kinds have been or are very rarely challenged about their opinions, or engaged in discussion. I would be a very good thing if they were. Sadly, the most quoted ones of the past – Barbet, Bucklin, Zugibe, etc. – have passed, and there don’t seem to any sufficiently bold today to have their ideas compared to those of the opposite persuasion. From ‘the man in the street”s point of view, this must remain a matter of opinion rather than fact.Point 7 says that Jesus’ body was looked after by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. This certainly seems a mark of considerable respect, but does not necessarily imply that Jesus was alive or dead.Point 8 considers the “hundred pounds” of myrrh and aloes. There is, I think, no doubt that these were used extensively in medicine (for alive people), and no doubt that the Jews, then as now, did not embalm their dead. If Jesus were alive, and his accomplices knew it, then myrrh and aloes would have been helpful in aiding recovery – although the wrapping over the head with a shroud seems a little odd in these circumstances. On the other hand, if Jesus was dead, then a hurried attempt to preserve the body until it could be properly attended to after the sabbath could also explain the myrrh and aloes adequately.I think in general that early Christianity rested on the “fact” of the Resurrection, in whatever form it took, and that therefore something occurred after the crucifixion of Jesus that must be able to be thought of as a Resurrection. A story put about by Peter, John or Mary Magdalen, or invented by St Paul does not seem an adequate explanation for this “fact,” nor a man who seems to have simply recovered after being crucified, but what, exactly, constituted it is currently further than most theologians, let alone historians, and certainly not me, are prepared to speculate.","date":"September 1, 2015 at 4:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

As usual, the “obvious” turns out to be almost the exact opposite. While few (perhaps none) of Stephen Jones’s observations are incontrovertibly incorrect, even fewer (perhaps all) are utterly unchallengeable.Let’s take a few, probably in no particular order.1) The two different angles of flow on the forearms correspond to the two different angles at which they were suspended on the cross. If this is so, then that pattern was maintained after the blood dried, the body was removed from the cross, transported to the tomb and ended up being transferred to the shroud, without being rubbed or washed off…2) unlike the dribbles of blood which would have descended from the spear thrust, which have mysteriously disappeared, to be replaced by the randomly directed dribbles we see today, zigzagging around below the wound and flowing from one side to the other of the shroud. From one side to the other at least twice, or possibly from one side to the other and back again. There is no pooling of blood in the middle, as might be expected from a shroud carrying a body – so how did it dribble across? Presumably it was before the body was placed on top, and dried so quickly that the body did not smudge or distort it all as it was laid down.3) It is easy to find pictures of people who have suffered head traumas. Do they have clean, stain-free hair, with a handful of well defined dribbles placed on the surface, as we see on the shroud? Nothing like. Blood, people seem to forget, starts at the scalp, and oozes its way through. If Jesus’s hair was matted with blood, it did not transfer to the shroud at all. Curious. Some people have suggested that the blood came from the sides of the face when the cloth was wrapped around the head (but nothing was transferred from the hair), and then the shroud was realigned to receive the image of the hair. If it is hair, and not a packing of spices.4) There have been quite convoluted attempts to distinguish between bloodflows that occurred during crucifixion and dried, bloodflows from wounds reopening as the body was taken down, and bloodflows from wounds reopening as the body was laid in the shroud. Also between wet, dry and re-wetted blood, and even venous and arterial. They are not based on the colour or appearance of the blood, but entirely on its position on the shroud, taking it for granted that the flows must be genuine and attempting to explain the inconsistencies. Nothing wrong with that, but the premise is not proved thereby.5) The flogging marks. These are very neat and tidy, as if the body had been washed clean, and then new exudates had seeped from the wounds onto the cloth. But if it wasn’t washed (see above for ‘crucifixion’ flows), then where is all the mess?6) The serum. The bloodstains are certainly not surrounded by neat rings of serum under UV light. One prong of the wrist stain has a kind of halo, the spear wound has a rim, and there is an interesting pattern on the big foot stain.  Much of the blood is completely without serum.7) The Oviedo cloth, to be sure, is not inconsistent with a seriously injured head. In fact it is so heavily marked it is not inconsistent with almost any assembly of serious head wounds. To claim it is a perfect match of blood and fluid stains is wholly unjustified.I could go on, but these will be enough, I hope, to encourage people who might otherwise have swallowed Jones’s article whole at least to go back to a photo of the shroud (not that absurdly miscaptioned image which graces Jones’s posting) and see for themselves whether these inconsistencies don’t need answering.","date":"February 18, 2013 at 10:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/18/stephen-jones-new-posting-on-the-bloodstains/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Stephen Jones’ New Posting on the Bloodstains"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, I thought there’d be repercussions. Daveb is, of course, eminently sensible, but Ron – if my style of argument is wrong, don’t fall into the trap of using it yourself. My figure of 100 000 crucifixions was based on 1 per day (for 200 years), which I think is a fairly mild assumption, plus, according to Josephus, 500 a day during rebellions. Is that unreasonable? Upon what do you base your “Maybe only 5000 were crucified during the whole period, for all we know” come from? That’s only 10 days rebellions’ worth.Next. You “would assume the taking down of the bodies and proper burial were NOT honoured” when Josephus specifically mentions that they were.Next: “Chances are spearing was a rare and unusual practice.” Now I’m guessing, I admit, but it’s a lot harder to smash a wooden beam against somebody’s legs than to run a spear into their heart. If a crucifixion victim were clearly already dead, the token stab with a spear seems an eminently more efficient guarantee of death than going to the trouble of breaking his legs. What makes you think spearing was rare and unusual?Next: “the excessive scourging as testified by the shroud.” The bible is quite specific in saying that the scourging was not excessive. Whatever, was excessive scourging rare? According to wikipedia (yes, I know) flagellation was used as a prelude to crucifixion, and at least four Roman authors refer to victims who died of their floggings.Next: “the crown of thorns.” What crown of thorns? The Shroud shows numerous bleedings from the scalp, not a crown of thorns. Instead of mocking a man who claimed to be king, a wreath, cap or helmet of thorns could have been inflicted on any leader of any riot, or a soldier, or anyone else who wore identifying headgear.Finally. Where are all the crucifixion victims’ skeletons? Why has only one turned up? Perhaps they have been found. Crucifixion, it seems, may well have left no damage to the bones, as the nails slid past them. The one heelbone we have with a nail right through it would be a clumsy exception to the rule. The associated armbones are undamaged (although some archaeologists claim slight abrasions to the inside edges, others don’t).Nope, I don’t think my assumptions are extraordinary at all.","date":"March 5, 2013 at 7:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/05/sturps-rudolf-dichtl-bloodstains-real-and-carbon-14-dating-has-to-be-redone/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"STURP’s Rudolf Dichtl:  Bloodstains Real and Carbon 14 Dating has to be Redone"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Who are you to contest what the experts say?

Without contradicting Heller and Adler’s findings, there is another consideration. The image, it must be remembered, is confined to the topmost fibres of the topmost threads. A random collection of fibres from the image areas of the shroud might consist of 5 per cent with “image” on them. The blood (or at least the serum, as most of the red blood has worn off) covered all the surface, has seeped into the cloth and emerged the other side. A random collection of fibres from a bloodstain might consist of 90 per cent with “blood” on them.Over the years, it is clear from photos that the upper surfaces of the threads (where the image is) have been almost completely denuded of red blood, which is confined to little crystals and concretions mainly in the interstices between threads, and one might speculate that most of the serum from those locations has also been rubbed or crumbled away.It is thus deduced that, in most of the areas where there is “blood,” there never was any “image,” and in most of the areas where there is “image,” the blood, if it was ever there at all, has been eroded away.In short, whether the blood arrived before or after the image, I would expect hardly any sample tested with protease to reveal any image underneath it.

Pellicori’s magazine article (1981) includes the words: “The nose area might also contain dirt or residual skin material.” This is not based on his own researches – his scientific papers contain no reference to dirt – but on speculative observation of Mark Evans’ micrographs. He does not mention the knee.John Klotz’s dependence on Heller is unsatisfactory. Here is a paraphrase of Heller’s account. Roger and Marty Gilbert dealt with reflectance spectroscopy. After measuring the background, they began at the foot and worked their way up the the body to obtain spectra. The heel spectrum was totally different from the others. When the Gilberts reached the knee, Sam Pellicori was called in to look at the foot area under the macroscope and found dirt. Actually, of course, the heel spectra look very little different from any other image spectra except in intensity, as can clearly be seen in their paper, and they never “moved slowly up the leg” or did any spectrographic tests on either knee. As they show, clearly, in their paper.So, back to my initial point. There is no evidence for dirt anywhere than on the foot, and precious little of that.

Jones references Mark Antonacci, who mentions dirt on the knee several times, but I cannot find his primary source. Jones particularly mentions the left knee, and it perhaps significant that no tape samples were taken from either the left knee or the nose.

Of course they must have had some reasons, but I don’t think Max necessarily gets any closer to them than anybody else.Apart from a general cultural awareness by 1950 of the pathological details of the image on the shroud, I agree with Colin that there are no grounds for supposing that de Brito had the Shroud in mind at all when he created his sculptures for Fatima.","date":"February 5, 2015 at 5:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“The Shroud is pathologically flawless.” Well sadly that is one of the opinions I find difficult to share.

If a two dimensional cloth is draped over a three dimensional surface, then it buckles, producing whole ridges of cloth which do not hang, but stick up (like tents?) away from the surface.

It is observed that there is an intensity/distance correlation, and assumed that this implies a distance/effector relationship, where the effector is some kind of radiation or vapour transfer. For this to work, it mst be assumed that the body itself is entirely homogenous in structure, so that there is no variation in effector intensity at its surface, whether it be skin, blood, hair, fingernail or teeth, and whether the underlying structure be fatty, bony, muscly or whatever. If, for example, the image is taken to be a result of some form of heat radiation, if would have to be assumed that the extremities of the body (hands and feet) did not emit less radiation than the core (chest and abdomen), or the distance/intensity relationship would fall down.If, of course, the body were indeed entirely homogenous in structure, such as a bas relief or similar, then heating it, or smearing it with some gas-emitting chemical, would produce minimum surface emittor variation, and a much more regular distance/effector, and thus distance/intensity, correlation.","date":"July 13, 2014 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/13/why-doesnt-the-blood-create-an-image/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Why Doesn’t the Blood Create an Image?"}],"coins":[{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"… or a conspiracy by the Catholic Church to remove marks which clearly demonstrated the more obvious signs of fakery …(Fantastic fraud theories work in both directions, it seems…)","date":"March 10, 2014 at 8:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/10/of-google-doodles-and-other-coincidences/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Of Google Doodles and Other Coincidences"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi, Clublu and welcome to the blog. Many of the aspects of the shroud get discussed quite frequently, and you can find out what’s been going on by hunting through the Categories on the right hand side.The ‘blood first’ theory is one of them. If the image is that of a dead body, then there is an a priori assumption that the blood oozed, seeped or blotted itself onto the shroud first, and the image was formed (by some process as yet unknown) afterwards. If, on the other hand, the image is artificial, then there is an a priori assumption that the image would be applied first, and then the blood.However, actual studies of the shroud are inconclusive. Although most of the bloodstains have eroded away to the point of a few encrustations clinging to the interstices of threads, the material underneath them, even in relatively dark image areas, does not seem noticably paler. Some commenters have claimed that this discolouration is due to blood-serum though, not to pre-existing image.Alan Adler concluded that the image was due to chemical corrosion or degradation of the surface of the fibres, and claimed that the surface of image bearing fibres was corroded, while the surface of non-image bearing fibres and the surface of fibres under bloodstains, was not. However his microscope photos are far from clear, and the evidence is not as conclusive as he may have hoped. Ray Rogers, on the other hand, eventually claimed that the image was not made of degraded fibres at all, but on a thin coating on top, in which case Adler was wrong about the degradation altogether, and the blood fibres should have the same coating as the rest of the shroud, just not discoloured.If the image is artificial, and formed by some sort of contact with a model or bas relief, either covered with a colourant or heated to make a scorch, then it is possible that blood was applied not to the shroud but to the model, in which case the blood would obscure the image making process, so that even artificially made, the blood could have preceded or at least occluded the image.As for the account of the Abbess of Sainte Claire, well, I’m just not sure. The book from which this was taken was written 350 years after the event. I should like to know the source of both this account and the one about the fire itself, with all its details about the blacksmith Guillaume Pussod and the famous drop of silver. And who translated it it, somewhat clumsily, into English? There are a number of anomalies I find difficult to accept as read.What is one to make of the abbess’s very precise description of the marks of the scourging: “the bruises and the scourge blows on the stomach are so thick that a pin-head large zone free from blows could hardly be found.” Strange that she should focus on the stomach (twice), which is almost free of scourge marks, rather than the chest which is covered in them. Then we have: “In the middle of the body, you can notice the signs of the iron chain tying him to the column so tightly that he appears all stained with blood.”Finally, after fifteen days of painstaking effort by four carefully chosen nuns, we were left with a set of the clumsiest and most ill fitting patches it is possible to conceive of, only four of the sixteen large holes being completely covered.","date":"March 10, 2014 at 6:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/10/of-google-doodles-and-other-coincidences/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Of Google Doodles and Other Coincidences"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"1-Adler came to his ‘blood first’ hypothesis by observing the corrosion on the surface of the fibres, which he thought increased in proportion to the darkness of the image, and did not exist on non-image fibres, nor on ‘blood-stain’ fibres. As far as I know Rogers did not independently corroborate this, and indeed, it directly contradicts his own subsequent decision that the fibres themselves were not affected by the image formation, which formed entirely on a purported “surface coating.’ I can’t find a reference to Bollone’s opinion on the subject; can you supply one for me?2-I suppose it depends how much the template is heated. I wasn’t suggesting blood was dripped onto an incandescent sheet. However I agree that a warm statue would take a very long time to make much impact on a cloth. Actually, I was thinking more of a paint in a slightly acidic medium, and blood dripped onto that, and the cloth placed on top.3-I have now found the original 1891 book! It’s very interesting, but will take a while for me to be sure I have correctly translated the French.4-Nuns in general were often renowned for their exquisite sewing – after all they had little else to do – and this team was personally selected to do the job. There is something very odd about what they actually produced.The rigor mortis discussion is another interesting one on philosophical rather than scientific grounds. For most of the shroud’s history the body has been described as perfect in every way, and only when critics began to point out irregularities was it necessary to try to explain them, either in terms of distortion of the body on a flat surface (rigor mortis) or conformity of the body to a contoured surface (such as a pillow of some kind), or the distortion due to the way the shroud was draped over the body, or some combination of all of these. Again, it used to be said that it was impossible for a painter to achieve such stunning anatomical accuracy – now it turns out the body isn’t that anatomically accurate after all, and so maybe a painter got bits of it wrong.For what my unsubstantiated opinion is worth, I am not keen on either the body or the statue, or even the bas relief. I think I’m plumping for a thick acidic paint at the moment, as thick as toothpaste, which would not seep through the cloth but would damage the topmost fibres of the threads. However, I wouldn’t put money myself on this hypothesis yet, so don’t push me for details!","date":"March 11, 2014 at 8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/10/of-google-doodles-and-other-coincidences/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Of Google Doodles and Other Coincidences"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Garlaschelli did indeed use an acidic paint, and his results were interesting but inconclusive.

Some ideas have been quietly dropped in the face of   clearer evidence to the contrary. The “bioplastic film” hypothesis of Garza-Valdez and Mattingly was a good idea for its time, but is generally rejected now, and John Jackson’s CO enrichment hypothesis failed in the face of actual experiment. Benford and Marino’s “patch” hypothesis, in its literal meaning, in which one side of a herringbone spine was 1st century and the other side was 14th century, has been modified to the “interweave” or “reweave” hypothesis, although opinion is still divided as to whether this involves the interweaving of new threads alongside old threads for at least a part of the mending and strengthening process (for which there should be, but is not, visible evidence), or whether the old threads have been unravelled for a small length and new threads spliced into them and glued with terpene, and then the whole section rewoven to be truly invisible. In view of the unrealistic intricacy of this work, and the fact that it would be a unique mend in the history of textile repair, and the generally shoddy nature of all the other repair and maintenance of the Shroud, this is also rejected by many, although Rogers, Heimburger and Fanti’s Vanillin and Cotton findings continue to keep the possibility alive.Jackson is currently wedded to some kind of nuclear enrichment process, and has no need of any interweave or contamination hypothesis, which he rejects on two connected grounds, firstly that photos of the area show uninterrupted threads and groups of threads (bands) extending right through the radiocarbon area, and secondly, that therefore there is no evidence of the 60% or so medieval material necessary to provide the skewed date.One other argument against medieval contamination has also been put forward by various people, which is that the coincidence of having exactly the right amount of contamination to provide a date exactly matching the first undisputed mention of the Shroud’s existence is too great to accept.Now, what was the question? Oh yes…..Good authenticists, like good non-authenticists, do not “just ignore” evidence which goes against their current thinking.

The EIGHT ‘dependent’ dates were combined in FOUR “independent dates.” Arizona seems to have set aside the thinnest piece of the two samples it received, and cut the other one in half. According to Marino and Benford’s patch hypothesis, Figure 2, one of these halves was pure patch, and the other one mostly shroud, with a little bit of patch at the top. One of these halves was set aside (later to be studied by Freer-Waters). The other half was cut into four, and these four samples independently burnt and reduced to little carbon pellets. At least two of these pellets were either pure shroud or pure patch. Each pellet was subjected to two “sputterings.” There were thus eight actual readings from the four samples tested. Each sample had its two readings averaged, to produce the four “independent dates.” Had there been a 16th century patch over a 1st century cloth, as speculated by Benford and Marino, then at lest two of these dates would have been pure 16th century or pure 1st century. This is not borne out by the published dates.Incidentally, it was good of the Arizona crowd to submit both their dates for each sample.

There’s not enough in the picture above to make me think it’s evidence that the painter knew the shroud, and as usual context is all. Taking Max’s list (incidentally, daveb, I think “both” refers to the psalter and the shroud, not to two images in the psalter):– “Both men are stark naked with long flow of hair in the back. Part of the hair tied up like apigtail at the back of the head can be made out.” A quick browse through the psalter shows that this illustrator is not at all afraid of nakedness; there are naked bodies throughout, from various angles and in various details. I do not detect a pigtail. Actually I think Max misses a trick here; what is unusual is not that Christ is naked, but that he has his back turned.– “Both have arm(s) bound/crossed in front. Had both no scourge marks on the inner sidearms? This cannot be checked today any longer.” Scourgings are usually shown with the hands tied in front. Other configurations are not unusual, but the comparison here is rather weak evidence.– “Both have bloodied furrows/scourged marks in conjunction with two whips with lashes each fitted with doubled (metal) pellets implying two executioners.” The two executioners are not merely implied, they are illustrated. However this configuration (Christ between two men) is hardly artistically improbable, and again, I don’t find it evidence. The two whips do have three thongs each, but they are tipped with one pellet each, not two. There is no depiction of crossed wounds (from both sides) on the body.– “Both have almost feminine curved left hip & thigh (to be called later “the Byzantine curve”)” This is wholly subjective, and I disagree with it. – “Both are/were tied at tibiofibural level with left leg in front of right leg (TS man accurateForensic description: left leg in front of right leg with rope-mark in the tibiofibular fleshes).” There is no evidence at all of a rope injury on the calves of the shroud image. On the shroud image the left leg is not in front of the right leg, the left foot is on top of the right foot, almost 90 degrees from the position of the left foot shown on the psalter.– “Both show a most unnatural/awkward feet position.” The psalter is as good as the artist could manage at the time (drawing feet from the back was particularly difficult). The shroud might seem to need the feet to be tied together to stop them falling away from each other, but it is easy to adopt its pose.– “And last but not least, by means of a very curious tailed-Epsilon hand sign each time, theexecutioner on the left seem to point with his left hand index finger to his own head while the executioner on the right does point to Christ’s head with his left hand index finger too. Both left hand signs cryptically echoe the tailed-Epsilon-shaped like small blood rivulet we can observe on TS man’s forehead, just above his left eyebrow.” The fingers of the characters throughout this and many other early psalters are indeed very interesting. In many cases they are drawn quite sensibly, and without distortion, but in many others they exhibit the long, almost snaky appearance we see on this picture. They occur throughout the psalter and are not connected with this one image, let alone the epsilon bloodmark. The index finger is unnaturally long, the little finger has an absurd downward curve, and there are often only four fingers on each hand.","date":"October 20, 2013 at 6:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/20/an-intriguing-9th-century-image-suggestive-of-the-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-max-patrick-hamon/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Intriguing 9th Century Image Suggestive of the Shroud – A Guest Posting by Max Patrick Hamon"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"John Klotz makes a good point above about the origins of artistic convention. How wonderful it would be if we could spot the original behind any particular convention, and observe how its influence spread out both geographically and temporally. Unfortunately, this is very rarely possible, and anybody’s interpretation is open to dispute. The Christ Pantocrator is sometimes supposed to have been modelled on the statue of Zeus at Olympia, which may have moved to Constantinople in the 5th century, and representations of the holy sepulchre as a box rather than a temple may derive from Constantine Monomachus’s rebuilding work in Jerusalem. Although the transitions are gradual, the young beardless Christ and the temple-sepulchre disappear completely, replaced by their substitutes. The same cannot be said of any of the putative shroud-derived iconography. Naked Christs, whip, nail and spear wounds appear sporadically here and there, among various other interpretations, on and off for hundreds of years. Depictions of shrouds themselves are particularly inconsistent.In the paragraph above, I have implied that artistic conventions derive from a particular image, but of course they may also derive from literature, in which case it would be more possible for images unrelated to each other nevertheless to look the same.To take John’s specific iconographical details:1) Nails through the wrists. Whatever the shroud shows, very few artists have copied it. This is not evidence that the shroud was known about before the 13th century.2) The crown of thorns. Barbet was probably the first to suggest that the shroud shows a cap rather than a wreath. It appears that practically no artist agrees with him, before or after the 13th century. This is not evidence that the shroud was known about before the 13th century.3) No whip wounds on the chest. Very few images of the flagellation show any wounds at all. Those that do, show wounds all over the chest. This is not evidence that the shroud was known about before the 13th century.It would be foolish to deny that there are some similarities between some aspects of the shroud and some depictions in medieval images. However, to claim that any of them became “artistic conventions” is, in my view, very far-fetched.","date":"October 20, 2013 at 12:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/20/an-intriguing-9th-century-image-suggestive-of-the-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-max-patrick-hamon/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Intriguing 9th Century Image Suggestive of the Shroud – A Guest Posting by Max Patrick Hamon"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Interesting idea.

I’m detecting considerable inconsistency of thought surrounding this contentious issue. Judging from what I can understand of the ‘patch hypothesis,’ a small section of the shroud had become so threadbare that fewer than one quarter of it survived. Into this was woven, invisibly even under magnification, replacement threads of a different colour. Although the interweaving was invisible, the difference in colour was apparent, so a water soluble pigment, combined with a water soluble plant gum for adhesion, was smeared over the cloth to make the new area match the old perfectly. If this description is incorrect, I hope one of the exponents of the ‘patch hypothesis’ will correct it.As it is, however, I’m surprised that even under close scrutiny, closer perhaps even than that of Flury-Lemburg, no evidence of the interwoven threads can be seen in the area immediately adjacent to the sample excision. I infer that the patching must have been confined to the 7mm or so closest to the side-strip. I consider that curious.Now for the paint. Rogers uses the word dye, which confused me for a while. A dye in its ordinary meaning is deeply absorbed into the structure of its substrate, and does not form a ‘coating’ and does not need a ‘gum.’ It is not affected by water, sweat, etc. A water-soluble paint is rather an odd choice to use to colour a corner of the shroud which is heavily handled. I consider that curious.In a twill cloth, a patch smeared with thick paint has two distinct sides. Every thread is three-quarters painted and one quarter unpainted on one side, and three quarters unpainted and one quarter painted on the other side. Although we cannot see all around Thread No. 7 in John Brown’s photograph, what we can see does not conform easily to this description. I consider that curious.There is a relevant corollary, albeit wholly unconnected to any ‘patch.’ Flury-Lemburg reproduces a photo (MECH16 in http://www.shroud.com/mechthild.htm) which shows the shroud lying image-down, the dorsal foot end, with the image side folded back over it. The difference in colour is staggering; the whole surface of the image side appears to be deeply stained. Even allowing for exaggerated contrast (not a feature of her other photo), there is something to be explained here.","date":"October 3, 2013 at 9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/03/and-then-too-we-have-two-comments-from-daveb-of-wellington/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"And then, too, we have two comments from Daveb of Wellington"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Alternatively, we can visit http://dwb4.unl.edu/Chem/CHEM869Z/CHEM869ZLinks/www.all.mq.edu.au/online/edu/egypt/carbdate.htm, which does all the fiddly stuff for you so you can concentrate on percentages.","date":"October 3, 2013 at 5:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/03/and-then-too-we-have-two-comments-from-daveb-of-wellington/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"And then, too, we have two comments from Daveb of Wellington"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes indeed it is, and to be fair to you I don’t know if the calculator I posted takes that into account.

If invisible patching could be established, it would cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating.2) The ‘bioplastic coating’ has been discredited by Rogers, who thinks it was a mistaken interpretation of some characteristics of the linen, by the radiocarbon scientists, who think it would have been removed by the cleaning procedure, and by simple observation, since there would have to be a huge amount of it to affect the date sufficiently.3) The tensile strength measurements had nothing to do with the alleged bioplastic coating, which had been dismissed long before they were carried out. They were more to do with the gradual disintegration of linen fibres by oxidation through age. Sadly, so many other factors also contribute to the disintegration that the proportion due solely to age is rarely calculable.4) The image may be the result of some painting or natural transfer mechanism which has since been washed off, leaving only degraded fibres behind. Rogers himself finally concluded that the fabric had indeed been ‘sized’, albeit accidentally and with no thought of image-making, as part of the manufacturing process.4) Almost any monochrome painting (or photograph) made full face, with the light from in front and a dark background, shows three dimensional attributes that are at least as good as and often better than those exhibited by the Shroud.

As for your photos, I note that instead of choosing a “monochrome painting (or photograph) made full face, with the light from in front and a dark background” as I suggested, you selected a heavily side-lit picture of Jules Verne to illustrate your point, coloured it in bright greens and blues, and then have the boldness to tell me I’m wrong!

Have a look at the shroud on shroudscope. The top of the head is not represented on the shroud, so it is impossible to say whether the ‘crown’ covered it or not. There are a number of ‘blood flows’ from the top of the brow, and some others around the base of the back of the skull. They could conform to any kind of spiky headgear.“The nailing thru the wrists instead of the hands.” The shroud is far from alone in showing this, and the recently deceased Dr Fred Zugibe thought that the nails may have gone in through the palms and exited at the wrists. Most statues show nails through the palms because of the danger of splitting the wood or plaster at the thinnest part of the arm.“The fact that no contemporary (middle age or Renaissance, supposedly) cultural or plastic archetypes demonstrated by the Shroud are reflected by “relics” that pilgrims could recognize.” I’m not sure what this means, but if you mean that the shroud doesn’t look like what a shroud “ought” to look like then I can only agree with you. If I were compelled to provide a ‘forgery hypothesis’ explanation for a) the fact that the shroud is long and thin instead of like a sheet and b) the fact that the shroud shows two bodies, front and back, then I would suggest that it may have been made to fit a particular space (above an altar, say) which happened to be 4m long and 1m wide. That being so, you could either have one image right in the middle (probably the back view), or both images, which would fill up the space more attractively. Convincing? no, not to me either, but it’s the sort of idea one might come up with.“One thing no one seems to ever mention is the fact that the figure of the Man of the Shroud is significantly longer in back than in front.” Another thing you can check for yourself. Superimpose two pictures, back and front, and using an ‘opacity’ slider, arrange them so that the heads and the tops of the bodies coincide. There turns out to be no great difficulty in registering the two images, except that the dorsal image includes the soles of the feet (if they were roughly at right angles to the legs the cloth could have been folded up over them), while the ventral image doesn’t. That’s why it looks longer.In this connection you might lie in bed one day with your legs bent. You will notice that whereas your ‘image’ on the bottom sheet would be shortened by bending your legs, the top sheet, conforming to the shape of your body, is about the same length as you. In other words the top image of the shroud should be longer than the bottom one, which it clearly isn’t. While pondering on this, you will also notice how little of the back of your legs actually makes contact with the sheet, and wonder how the image of the back of the legs comes to be as clearly defined as the image of the front.","date":"October 8, 2013 at 7:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/03/and-then-too-we-have-two-comments-from-daveb-of-wellington/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"And then, too, we have two comments from Daveb of Wellington"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I don’t think you can simply say “wrong!” Whether one representation of a 3D face looks better than another is a subjective judgement, and to my mind, the modern photograph looks better than the shroud when subjected to similar treatment.You can certainly allege that the shroud image contains more information than the modern photograph, however, and for that you may be correct. If, however, the brightest parts of the shroud face (forehead, nose and beard) were all close to, or in contact with, the shroud, I think that implies that the shroud was definitely draped over the body, so that it made contact with those three features, which it certainly would not have done if it had been horizontal.

(Oh, dear, I hope I’m not turning into Colin!)Rogers did not come up with any method of dating anything. He observed that his samples from the C-14 sample contained vanillin (wholly unquantified) while samples from the rest of the shroud did not. Vanillin decays with time. He therefore claimed, quite correctly if his results were accurate, that the C-14 sample was younger than the rest of the shroud. That was all he wanted to discover, and it was all he claimed. It was not a dating method.Fanti has come up with genuine dating methods, but they are not sufficiently controlled or calibrated to be at all satisfactory in most cases. After gathering about 20 samples for testing, 30% were discarded as unsuitable anyway, although he does not say why.Firstly, he finds that if a piece of linen is left alone over time, it seems to lose structural integrity (measurable by mechanical means) in a rather roughly predictable way, resulting in a possible assessment of the age of a piece of undisturbed cloth. As the shroud has been continuously manipulated since its manufacture, whether for 1000 or 2000 years, and as Fanti’s test samples were, by selection by vacuuming, from the most degraded fibres, his graph is wholly inappropriate for dating the shroud.Fanti has also attempted two spectroscopic methods, in which I am insufficiently versed to be able to declare an opinion. I can say that, when he found that the shroud did not conform to his prejudice about its age using FT-IR, he was compelled to adjust its age to account for the effects of the 1532 fire, a case of special pleading if ever I saw one.Fanti is quoted as saying that four different independent methods reached the same result. This is wholly untrue. Rogers, as I said above, reached no result at all. Fanti’s mechanical result was 400 AD, his FTIR result was 750 BC (before adjustment), and his Raman result 200 BC.

A significant feature is that this gives a spread of +/- 30 years, which is quite satisfactory. If we follow the Nature data, and include the post-1330 bump, and the impossible post-first-appearance 1390, then we get a spread of +/- 65 years, which seems excessive but is an artifact of the calibration curve.To those who don’t really grasp statistics, it seems crazy that if two people count 70 and 80 cows in a field, there is a statisitical probability that there are in fact only 4, but that’s how they work!","date":"January 21, 2015 at 6:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/21/bsts-article-by-hugh-farey/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"BSTS Article by Hugh Farey"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Oops!

The papyrus fragment measures 8cm x 4cm, from which enough material for two separate radiocarbon measurements have been taken. In 1988 it would have required about 10% of the entire artifact. It appears that the shred given to the AMS lab in Arizona was actually too small, and, because it was in danger of being reduced to almost nothing, the cleaning procedure wasn’t completed. Presumably the second attempt at Woods Hole used a bigger sample.Without knowing the provenance of the papyrus, the amount tested, or the procedure carried out by Gregory Hodgins, I wouldn’t place a probability on any particular reason for the anomalous dates, but reasonable scenarios can be suggested. One that comes to mind is the possibility of dissolved limestone in the water in which the papyrus grew, or was manufactured. The carbon atoms in limestone can be millions of years old, and contain no C14 at all. Unless they are carefully removed, the papyrus dates much older than it actually is, and if the acid washing required was curtailed or reduced, that may account for the first, anomalous, date.","date":"April 10, 2014 at 7:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/carbon-dating-problems-with-the-jesus-wife-fragment/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Carbon Dating Problems with the “Jesus’ Wife” Fragment"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Karen King’s own article in the same edition of the Harvard Theological Revue.","date":"April 11, 2014 at 3:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/carbon-dating-problems-with-the-jesus-wife-fragment/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Carbon Dating Problems with the “Jesus’ Wife” Fragment"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Forgive me, Louis, but I feel you are making insinuations.

I’m here, and very willing to give you something concrete to work on.1) For instance, I claim that the Discovery Channel video “Unwrapping the Shroud” is pitifully misleading when it underplays a commentary about a UV photo of one end of the Shroud by displaying a Quad Mosaic photo of the other end.2) For instance, I claim that all the quad mosaic photos taken by the STURP team show substantial areas of blue across the top half, which I deny can represent differences in chemical composition.3) For instance, I claim that three different scientists of unimpeachable integrity have come up with totally different estimates of the amount of cotton to be found in the ventral ‘missing corner’ area of the Shroud which are inconsistent with a single reweaving operation.4) For instance, I claim that the Holland cloth is bright white under the Shroud, but has been stained on its exposed areas in an attempt to match the Shroud more closely.Are those statements concrete enough? Now, here’s a challenge for you. Take my statements one by one (numbered for easy reference) and say whether you agree with me or not, and if not, why not.1) Is the Discovery Channel video misleading or not? Does it show the wrong picture or not?2) Do the quad mosaic pictures have blue areas or not? Do the blue bands represent different chemcal composition or not?3) Do Fanti, Heimburger and Villarreal give different admixtures of cotton in the so-called patch reweaving or not? Are their findings consistent?4) Is the Holland cloth different colours beneath and outside the Shroud or not? Is it painted to match the Shroud or not?There you go, Louis. Concrete. Be bold.

Is this the De Charnay hypothesis? Credit where it’s due; it’s not mine, it’s Colin’s. But I will reply to your specific points, if you like.I, Colin and Thibault Heimburger have spent a lot of time on the scorch hypothesis and there is more to do. At the moment I’ve gone off it, but may be reconverted after further experiment!1) I don’t think anyone suggests trying to ‘paint’ the Shroud with a hot iron! It would be a very clumsy way of doing things, almost certainly burn holes right through, and, as you say, flatten the weave noticeably (although who’s to say it might not have recovered since then?)2) Both Colin and I have demonstrated that a very good 3D effect can be achieved using an appropriate model with which to make contact with the cloth. Although intensity drops off very sharply when contact is lost, considerable variation in intensity can be achieved by variation in pressure. A hot brass face pressed downwards onto a cloth supported by a soft pad gives darker scorches where the nose is in contact than where the cheeks are, for example.The scorching experiments by the STURP team did not address this because they were not designed to.As for teeth and X-ray fingers, I’m sorry but I don’t see them, and don’t believe they are there.3) Eh? I’m not sure whether bodily decomposition is relevant here. There is a hypothesis (described in http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n78part11.pdf) by Giovanni Fazio that the warmth of a dead body might have selectively stimulated chemical reaction on a pre-prepared sheet, but even he does not associate it with biological decomposition.4) The wounds on the Shroud can easily be reproduced by painting, do not necessarily reflect 1st century Roman crucifixion practices accurately, and have no 3-D information or interesting negative quality. I think you are confusing the bloodstains with the image.As for the overall hypothesis, I’m not persuaded either, but I certainly wouldn’t ignore it. Stranger things have happened.","date":"January 24, 2014 at 2:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Ooh, flattery will get you anything.Still,When I say the wounds can be reproduced by painting, I mean they are fairly easy to simulate using paint, blood or a mixture, although until what they were actually made of is established, it will be impossible to replicate their chemistry. It was their shapes I was thinking of.Much to most people’s surprise, we have very little idea of what a Roman flagrum (or flagellum) looked like. None have ever been found, and there are a few illustrations on coins and the like, all different. It was obviously some kind of thonged whip, but how many thongs or tips, and what the tips might have been made of, is anyone’s guess (see Mel Gibson’s Passion film). It may be that the marks on the shroud exactly match a Roman flagrum, or it may be that a painter just came up with a good idea. The two designs of Roman flagrum that copies have often been made of and photographed were based specifically on measurements made of the Shroud itself, and do not even resemble the ancient illustrations.Much to most people’s surprise, we have no idea whether people were nailed through the palms, hands or lower arms. Although elaborate demonstrations with real corpses have shown how a hanging body would be too heavy for a dead weight on the arms, many Roman descriptions mention a sedile or seat, sometimes described as a horn sticking out, on which the victim sat, removing all the weight from his arms altogether. It may be that the nails through the wrists thing exactly match a Roman crucifixion, or it may be that a painter just thought it might be a good idea (perhaps he experimented on corpses too!).Much to people’s surprise, blood does not trickle down the outside of hair. It oozes out from the scalp and mats it into a bloody mass. Google news pictures of terrorists bombs for confirmation. To be fair, some people have supposed that the blood flows down the side of the face were imprinted on the shroud from the cheeks, whereafter the shroud realigned itself horizontally to receive the image of the hair, which was thus out of register with the blood flows. However this does not account for the trickles which appear at the back of the head.Much to people’s surprise, blood does not zigzag out of a stab wound to the chest, it flows straight down. To be fair, some people have surmised that the bloodflow from the chest occurred after the body had been taken down from the cross and the original blood had been washed off, and stained the cloth as the body was wrapped or draped with it. This is quite a reasonable scenario.You mentioned earlier that the wounds could not be “drawn in by any genius artist to match in 3-D information and negative quality.” All the blood flows are now fairly uniform pinkish stains, and do not display any particularly interesting features in terms of any relationship between their colour intensity and distance, which is the basis of the 3D effect, or in terms of their negativity (they just turn green).Delighted to be of assistance!","date":"January 24, 2014 at 6:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Anonymous, thank you so much for your very pertinent comment, which sent me scurrying back to Adler’s papers! Sadly, the second, ‘Further Spectroscopic Investigations of Samples of the Shroud of Turin,’ seems only to be available in his book “The Orphaned Manuscript” which is completely unobtainable. Even more sadly, that particular chapter is not accessible via Google books.The other paper you mention, ‘Updating Recent Studies on the Shroud of Turin,’ is available, at http://www.sindone.info/ADLER.PDF, but makes slightly disappointing reading in that it refers to, but does not explain or describe, various experiments that might be relevant.Adler characterises the radiocarbon area as “in an obviously waterstained area just a few inches from a burn mark.” This is slightly disingenuous, I feel. Benford and Marino rather precisely demonstrate that the edge of the nearest waterstain passes through the ‘riserva’ part of the sample rather than the dated section, and, of course, most of the Shroud is just a few inches from a burn mark. A quick sketch of the area of the Shroud gives precious little choice of where else to take the sample from, and I often wonder where other people would have taken it from if they had found themselves in Giovanni Riggi’s place.The only actual finding described by Adler in this article is summarised by Figure 1, which shows FTIR spectra for various threads. Adler says: ‘The patterns seen in Figure 1 are all distinguishably different from one another clearly indicating differences in their chemical composition.” I’m afraid I disagree with this. The differences between the ‘image,’ ‘non-image,’ and ‘radiocarbon warp’ spectra are qualitative rather than quantitative, and seem well within the limits of experimental variation. Villarreal discusses this very well in his Ohio lecture.Adler goes on to claim that “peak frequency analysis” shows that the radiocarbon and Shroud fibres are different, but without showing any data as evidence, and also mentions the “scanning electron microbrobe data that showed gross enrichment of the inorganic mineral elements in the radiocarbon samples.” I believe he may be referring to his discovery that 2% of the radiocarbon sample was aluminium, but again, he gives no data.Finally he says that “the radiocarbon sample fibres appear to be an exaggerated composite of the waterstain and scorch fibres.” I don’t even know what this means, but it seems to be contradicted by his own Figure 1 (where the radiocarbon sample is more like the non-image sample than either the waterstain or the scorch), and his aluminium finding (which is not present in either the waterstain or the scorch).Of all of this it seems that it is his aluminium finding which is most quoted by those looking for support for the patch hypothesis. Alum, it seems, was a common medieval mordant for madder root dye, and fits in rather better with Rogers’s finding than his own gum arabic, which is a sticky glue which dissolves when wet.All in all, I think that the aluminium finding is relevant to my article, and agree that I should have included it. I would have if I had known about it!However, as has been commented elsewhere, there is no way in which 16th century surface contamination could be responsible for changing a 1st century date into a 13th century one. The proportions of the two must be about 60% medieval to 40% ancient to achieve the mixture, and even the dullest of observers must have noticed that amount, even with a hand lens.","date":"January 24, 2014 at 1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Another idea well worth pursuing. Firstly, although I am certain that what I have previously described as “gunk” (i.e. surface contamination including any wandering cotton fibres, wax, silk, oils, paint and any other debris) would have been removed by the cleaning process, I cannot be sure that a fast dye would be. I have some madder root soaked linen drying in my laboratory as I speak, mordanted with alum. I shall give it a week to dry, then wash it with acids and alkalis as described in the Nature paper to see if it all disappears or not. Watch this space!However, even if I didn’t wash it all away, its tiny mass compared to that of the cloth itself would mean that its effect on the carbon content of the shroud would be trivial and quite possibly not measurable within the experimental accuracy of the dating process.Another idea might be simply to increase the number of C14 atoms within the molecular structure of the linen itself. This is difficult to do just by burying the sample in charcoal, (you could shake it off) but was thought to be possible if carbon atoms from, say, the gas carbon monoxide were to diffuse into the cloth, either reacting with it or simply exchanging carbon atoms by some atomic diffusion process.Good plan, and it was tried out, but didn’t work. See “https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/embed.php?File=shroud.html” for Chrstopher Ramsay’s explanation. What’s more, it was predicted not to work as no such effect has been observed on any other artifact.Nevertheless, one experiment does not constitute a definitive rebuttal, and there is a (pretty faint) possibility that the circumstances uniquely surrounding the Shroud could have led to a C14 enrichment. Ray Roger’s, for example, thought that the thymol with which the Shroud has recently been treated as an antibiotic might interact with the linen (making subsequent radiocarbon dating impossible), and if something similar to that had happened in the past, then it might have distorted the date appropriately. Thymol itself has not been observed to have any effect on radiocarbon dating, as it happens, so all is not lost from a new sampling point of view.Fire is unlikely to have had any effect. For a start many archaeological radiocarbon dates have been satisfactorily established using charcoal from cooking fires, and secondly part of the dating process involves the complete combustion of the sample under test.","date":"January 24, 2014 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Intervening posts have appeared while I was writing the above!I can’t agree that any parts of the linen of the shroud are likely to be sufficiently different in terms in terms of carbon content that any two random threads would date more than 100 years apart, let alone 1000, I’m afraid, and that includes the image and burn hole edges.

The details are in ‘AMS Radiocarbon Dating of Medieval Textile Relics: the Frocks and the Pillow of St Francis of Assisi,’ M. Fedi et al, Science Direct, 2009. (Behind a paywall, I’m afraid).Beginning with “dating of materials connected to faith is always a delicate matter,” which has a famiiar ring to it, the authors discuss where, exactly, they took their radiocarbon samples from.“Samples were taken following the advice of a textile conservator, who examined the manufacture of the relics. No darns or patches were present.” Sounds familiar?“Anyway, [interesting adverb…] we decided to sample several pieces from each frock.”From one ‘frock,’ “supposed to have covered St Francis just in the moment of his death,” the team took seven samples, about 1cm2 each, three from the hem, two from the end of one of the short sleeves, one from the side, and one from slap in the middle of the back. The frock was made of several pieces of wool sewn together, and the samples came from different pieces. The samples were washed in an ultrasound bath, then in hydrochloric acid, but not in sodium hydroxide as it was thought detrimental to wool.One of the hem samples and the one from the side fell to pieces during cleaning and couldn’t be used. The others gave dates of between 1155 and 1225, a 70 year spread which was assumed consistent. This compares with the Shroud findings (12 samples from the same place) of between about 1225 and 1315, a 90 year spread.St Francis died in 1226, which fitted this frock (and the pillow, as it happens) well. The other frock was dated to about 1300, and was therefore considered not a genuine relic, although the authors say, rather charmingly, that “these data are not to be read in a negative way, since the result of its dating can anyway be a valuable element for the reconstruction of the history of religion during Middle Ages.”The circumstances of the two radiocarbon datings make interesting comparison, I feel. One important point is that, even in 2005, a 1cm2 area is considered a minimum sample for accurate dating, whereas in 1988 every laboratory subdivided its sample further and tested each one separately. No wonder their experimental error bars were so much bigger, especially those of Tucson, which dated roughly 0.2cm2 pieces.","date":"January 25, 2014 at 6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Oh dear, what about this?

I won’t go through it in detail, but it does not refute any of my previous arguments. Some of it is transparently wrong as can be confirmed by anybody with an iPad or a few of the 1978 STURP papers. The very opening sentence, for example: “The herringbone weave, that is so consistent throughout the main body of the shroud…” This is nonsense. The herringbone weave is irregular, in some places extremely so, and the thickness of both warp and weft threads varies irregularly throughout the shroud, the thickest threads being up to 5 times thicker than the thinnest.Surely I cannot be the only person in the world who has actually seen French reweaving. It is extremely clever and painstaking work, but pefectly visible under a microscope where the new threads lie alongside the old. It is very well illustrated by the top photos at http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/showthread.php?120259-My-first-go-at-reweaving. In this repair, three or four white threads, perhaps 10 to 20 mm long, have been threaded alongside broken verticals, joining up a break of a few millimetres. It looks as if horizontal blue threads have been added too, but they are less clear. In the video Sue Benford describes the threads as having been twisted together, which would be even more obvious. I have searched hard for this kind of evidence (how I would love to find it!) on Shroud 2.0 without success.Has anybody else whose blind faith in everything that confirms their prejudices and blind rejection of everything that doesn’t even looked?I thought not.Is it just me getting old that I get irritated by people who direct me to look at things they clearly have not really looked at themselves? Why don’t you read this, says John, or look at that, says Annette. Well I have, and in detail, and they don’t say what you think they say. Further on in the video Ray Rogers, in voiceover, describes looking at the ultraviolet photos of the shroud. The photos which accompany this are patently obviously not ultraviolet photos – they are quad mosaic scans – and more absurdly still, they are not even of the radiocarbon corner of the cloth!

Two of them are enlargements of others. Three of the remaining four show exactly the same colouration: namely a pale blue upper, bright yellow middle and orange base, with green lower left-hand corners. The fourth has a blue central smudge which does not extend as far as the other three.In his article “Some Details about the STURP Quad Mosaic Images” (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf) Barrie Schwortz quotes Jean Lorre, as follows:“There was a strong illumination brightness falloff from the centre. This was eliminated by dividing each image by a flat field.”Well it wasn’t, was it? Each of the images is brighter in the centre than it is around the edges. The flat field process may have diminished the brightness falloff, but it didn’t eliminate it, and that’s important. What Lorre is clearly explaining is what was hoped, or expected, not what actually happened. Let’s go on.“We wanted to enhance the colour to reveal subtle colours which might betray spatial variations in chemical composition. […] we greatly exaggerated the colour saturations while preserving the original hues and intensities.”A noble idea, but it didn’t work. Lorre wishes so much that it had, that he loses all touch with his own images in his next sentence.“These colour images should be interpreted as a chemical composition map.”Shall we take him at his word? Shall we agree that the blue bands across the top of three of the quad images really represent different chemicals from the yellow and orange below them? What might these blue bands be? They may be found across the front of the thighs, the head, and the buttocks. Shall we?Or shall we agree that the illumination of the areas of the shroud by the photographic lights are responsible, and the colours have nothing to do with the chemical composition of the shroud at all.Oh, and the image described as “ultraviolet” by Rogers? It’s the shape of the patches which gives it away. It’s the one captioned Quad Mosaic Dorsal Legs, which shows the bloodstained feet at the top, and nearly reaches the buttocks at the bottom.

Listen to the commentary: “When we went back and looked at the ultraviolet photographs…” At this point the video shows the quad mosaic photograph of the back of the legs of the body, as far away from the radiocarbon corner as can be. You can clearly see the bloodstains of the feet at the top of the photo. “Here is this area that is significantly darker – it doesn’t fluoresce as much…” The camera is panning down and across to the bottom left hand corner of the quad mosaic picture of the Dorsal Legs. “It’s just this area around the Raes sample and where the radiocarbon sample was cut.” We have reached a close up on the lower left hand area of deep green, and then cut back to Rogers.Yes there is a green patch over the lower left hand corner of the ventral lower legs (where it appears over the radiocarbon corner), but there is also a green patch on the lower left hand corner of the dorsal lower legs (where it appears just to left of the upper thigh), and a green patch on the lower left hand corner of the ventral torso (where it appears level with the groin) , and a green patch on the lower left hand corner of the dorsal torso (where it appears next to the back of the head). In fact every quad photo has a green patch in its lower left hand corner. The green patch is not abnormal. The green patch appears in the same place on every photo. So does the blue patch. So does the rest of the colouring. The green patch is not peculiar to the radiocarbon corner.

As for the LANL findings, I thoroughly recommend Robert Villarreal’s lecture about them on YouTube, where you will find he is much more uncertain about them than might be expected. He does not find the images at all unequivocal.As to Benford and Marino. Both their Ohio presentation (http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p09.pdf), and their Chemistry Today paper (http://shroud.com/pdfs/benfordmarino2008.pdf) begin with the Quad Mosaic evidence, as if they considered that the most significant. I agree that their 2000 didn’t even mention it though, so you’re probably correct about the chronology.It’s perfectly true that there are no clear photos of the weaving discrepancies observed by the various expert tailors. The same poor quality photo is reproduced in their 2000 and their 2008 papers. It would be good if Joe could confirm or deny that that was the photo used. Now, of course, one would use Shroud 2.0, as I did.By doing so, I believe I have a much better idea of the inconsistency of the thickness of the threads of the shrouds than the tailors consulted. And I can see the same inconsistency all over the shroud, not just in one tiny place. And forgive me for using the term tailor instead of textile experts. I mean no disrespect; certainly not. However, to me a textile expert is a university academic, while a tailor is a practitioner. Joe makes very clear that his experts are tailors, but not that they are academics. I have no doubt that they can be just as knowledgable however, and do not automatically therefore elevate Mechtilde Flury-Lemberg’s opinions above theirs.And yes, I agree. I’m a scientist. Sitting on the fence is what we do best…Can anything be wrong with the impeccable C14 tests? Well yes. The Riani and Atkinson paper is very persuasive, and I find it very odd that nobody from the radiocarbon dating cares to defend themselves against the very serious accusations of incompetence and fraud which have been levelled against them. However the idea that water soluble contaminents are likely to have affected the procedure I think is weak, and the oft-quoted but vague assertion that radiocarbon dating is often wrong is weaker still. There are anomalous radiocarbon dates, to be sure, but they are nearly always easy to explain.

Oh, well, I’m doing it again.However, moving on:The photo in Morgan’s paper shows two adjacent areas of backing cloth coloured in very different ways. The ‘missing corner’ section is brown, but the area which had been covered by the Raes sample is white. Something similar is apparent in Barrie Schwortz’s transmitted light photos too. Seeing as this photo cannot be easily reconciled with Miller and Pellicori’s UV setup and photos in their Biological Photography paper, I surmise that this photo is a visible light photo – albeit somewhat modified.Disappointingly, I cannot find a picture of the radiocarbon corner, including the backing cloth, taken after the sample was cut, but before the Holland cloth was replaced. Can anyone help?Because I predict (dangerous), that the area that had been concealed under the radiocarbon sample area will be as white as the area that had been under the Raes sample area.How to explain this? Was something smeared over that corner, and, for that matter, the burn holes as well, after the shroud had been stitched to the Holland cloth, to try to make the colours more uniform? Did it include a mixture of madder root dye and gum arabic? And was it applied with a cotton pad? Are shreds of cotton, dyed with madder and glued down with gum arabic, found along the edges of the shroud adjacent to the Holland cloth – including the edges of the burn holes?It’s new, it’s revolutionary, and you read it here first, folks!Now, anoxie.1) I don’t think it has been satisfactorily demonstrated that cotton fibres are anywhere an integral part of the spinning of any of the thread in the the shroud, or of the weaving of the cloth.2) As the amount of cotton per thread varies, according to observer, from 2% to 100% in the radiocarbon area, I have no difficulty in supposing that fibres in different proportions can be found anywhere on the shroud.3) Had the cotton been an integral part of the threads being tested, the cleaning process would not have removed it. Being only a surface contaminent, it was picked off, vacuumed off, or shaken off with ultrasound.I agree with the speculative nature of much of my posting.

Progressive contamination of the sample strip seems to me well established. What they did not demonstrate was that the contamination had made a 1st century piece cloth appear to be 13th century.As for the Rossman dating, it appears to be extremely suspect. Apart from Caltech’s own formal denial that Rossman had ever had any dealings with the shroud, or that he had any experience or expertise in dating, or that he had access to FTMS anyway (http://www.shroud.com/late02.htm), it should be noted that FTMS is a hopelessly inadequate method of attempting to quantify a proportion of C14 to C12 atoms, as is even admitted in Benford and Marino’s Textile Evidence paper (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/textevid.pdf). Adler, from whom this information was obtained, claimed that Rossman was “the world’s expert in it [dating], and there’s no arguing with him.” That statement was palpably untrue.Some mention has been made of the ‘fact’ that the different ends of the alleged spliced thread have different twists. This is not obvious from Rogers’s photo, and in fact proves that the splice does not exist, as splicing is only possible if the twists are the same, otherwise the splice would simply unravel as it was being made. (Don’t take my word for it – try it out!)Finally, Max says that Hall, Testore and Villarreal also all thought they could see spliced threads. I don’t believe they did, and I don’t believe they said they did. Can Max give us any reference to their findings to substantiate his claim? Villarreal, in particular, looked at threads he was given by Rogers, Benford and Marino and decided that the two ends were the same material (cotton) and that they hadn’t been spliced but glued together. On the basis of the three cotton threads he was given, he felt that the corner piece was not typical of the rest of the shroud (which appears to be pure linen), but as he wasn’t given a representative sample, he could hardly determine how unrepresentative it was.Apart from the punctuation, I have enjoyed reading Max’s extracts from his Research Paper. However, very little of his information is backed up by sources, which no doubt appear at length at the end of the paper.

It looks more as if the two ends were simply butted together and glued with that “crust” which, surprisingly, is wholly invisible on the picture of the intact thread, and which, in spite of being a completely different colour, Rogers missed.  Whichever it is, however, there is no known method of invisible repair which uses such a splice/join as a way of adding its repair material, and it is difficult to envision any reason why anybody should want to.I understand your point about the discrepancy between the FTIR findings (cotton), and your observations (linen mixed with cotton), but am not convinced that all or even most of the Raes and/or C14 sample was made of these interpolated fibres, of whatever material.

Bucklin is the least sure of himself, but tends to follow Barbet in all his observations, but Zugibe thinks rather little of either of them, for example demolishing Barbet’s ideas about the “space of Destot” quite ruthlessly, calling him confused and making a serious anatomical error. He also rejects asphyxiation as a cause of death.5) Scourging is not uncommon today, and a quick Google for “flagellation” and “Philippines” will show you what it looks like.

Now let’s see.“A KGB agent hacked into the AMS system control console computer at each of the three C-14 labs and inserted a program which … would yield years clustering around AD 1325, just before the Shroud’s appearance in undisputed history in the 1350s.” Response: I consider that any agency capable of doing that was capable of hacking into a great many far more important things than an archaeological dating, and probably extending the cold war far into the 21st century. I think the writing of the ‘fake’ program and its physical replacement in the AMS calculating machine would require a detailed knowledge of the system, and could not be done by somebody popping in one evening. I think the likelihood of this happening three times is, to use a well-worn expression “overwhelmingly” improbable.“You fail to consider what a perceived threat it would be to the Soviet Union if the Shroud was dated to the first or early centuries.” I don’t believe the dating of the Shroud was anything but trivial to the Soviet Union. Not only did the announcement of the 14th century date have absolutely no effect on the Catholic or any other Christian Church, if it did anything to the Soviet Union it simply accelerated its downfall, which occurred very soon afterwards.“You denigrate me personally by calling my proposal a “conspiracy theory” with all its negative connotations.” A plot by the KGB to subvert workers in three different laboratories in three different countries so that they wrote, taped and replaced a minor calculation program in an archaeological laboratory to attempt to discredit Christianity by misdating one of its relics, without any evidence for such a plot whatever, is a conspiracy theory by any standards. Such theories often have negative connotations because, as there is no evidence for them, the evidence cannot be examined or disproved. A conspiracy theory for which there is some evidence has no negative connotations.“My bottom line is that, since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud to convert a 1st century actual date of the Shroud into the too good to be true 1325 ± 65 years date.” Quite. That there is no room for doubt in Stephen’s mind that the shroud is authentic is fair enough, but to claim that a logical consequence of the shroud’s authenticity is that there HAD to be some sort of fraud, is simply non-sense.“My proposal that the labs were duped by a computer hacker fits all the facts.” No, it doesn’t. The facts, about the staff at the laboratories, the nature of the calculator program, the plans of the KGB, how the KGB communicated to its agents, the means of replacing the old program with the new and how such a replacement went undetected have not been considered or presented. Your proposal is not contradicted by the very few facts to hand, which is a very different thing. Such facts as have been discovered, by people who have tried to examine the facts supporting your theories rather more than you have yourself, have wholly discredited the ‘single computer hacker’ theory.“Yes, slogans like “conspiracy theory” are excuses not to think about the problem.” How I wish that were true. Unlike, I suspect, its author, I have thought about it in detail since it was proposed. I wrote to the laboratories involved for evidence, I considered the effect the successful execution of this theory actually had on Christianity and on the Soviet Union. Did he?“I made NO ‘Satanic allegations about Pope Francis’. All I wrote … was:“But if the Shroud is a deliberate fraud, then it would almost certainly be a work of Satan, and no Church that calls itself Christian should be promoting a deliberate fraud (much less a work of Satan)!” This is disingenuous. the rest of your quote is: “But if the Shroud is authentic (as the evidence is overwhelming that it is), then Jesus whose image would then be on the Shroud, who commanded His followers: ‘Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil.” (Mt 5:37) would presumably not be pleased with the Roman Catholic Church’s duplicitous official position on His burial shroud.” As the church refuses to say ‘Yes’ or ‘No,’ then your own quotation declares the church’s attitude to ‘come from evil.’“And even if my proposal that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker turns out to be wrong, that does not make my other ‘convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud … utterly worthless.’” Sadly, it does. And I agree that that’s very unfair. But that’s the trouble with extremism. However, toning things down a little may help to re-establish credibility. “I am PERSUADED BY THE EVIDENCE that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Jesus Christ and bears His crucified and resurrected image.” That’s a very good start. “Since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud.” That’s extremism.“I note that no one has responded to the points I made above, but instead they have repeated ad hominems and/or changed the subject.” Well I hope that’s all sorted out now.Best wishes in Christ.","date":"March 11, 2014 at 5:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Stepen, this is absurd.

I’m afraid I believe that this simply means that the shroud was actually manufactured at about that time, in which case, of course, it’s not amazing at all. Even if it were genuine, however, and the C-14 date represents an admixture of contamination, a 14th century date would not be very astonishing.

The photograph, unchanged, is reproduced in the paper as Figure 1. It is in varying shades of brown, with a very bright area from the backing cloth where the Raes sample was cut. Now I have Miller and Pellicori’s 1981 paper published in the journal of Biological Photography, which includes a detailed description of the set up for the UV photographs, and six well reproduced photographs. Neither the set up nor the photographs are at all consistent with the photograph which claims to be one of their photographs in Morgan’s paper. Their photographs are grey-blue rather than brown, and do not extend to the edges of the shroud. They exclude the radiocarbon corner altogether. In view of these comments I dispute that the photograph analysed by Morgan is a UV-F photograph at all. Can you clarify that?The paper goes on to increasingly elaborate methods to demonstrate that the colour of the radiocarbon area is different from the rest of the shroud, but does not even mention, let alone discuss, that that the area around the burn holes is exactly the same colour. It is a major argument against Morgan’s hypothesis that difference in colour represents difference in chemical composition, but he doesn’t even notice it.By far the biggest anomaly in the picture is the difference between the adjacent areas of Holland cloth, the area of the ‘missing corner’ and the area which once backed the Raes sample. If difference in colour represents difference in chemical composition, this is extremely significant.

Members of STURP could no doubt have suggested a better area, so could any of the radiocarbon scientists, and so could you or me, but really anybody could have guessed that where it was finally taken was more or less inevitable.As for the radiocarbon date being wholly discredited, I fear wishful thinking is coming into play here. Challenged, I grant you, and quite respectably, but without a little more information about where Rogers got his evidence about “other medieval linen” and “other very old linens” it can hardly be said to be seriously threatened. Vanillin has been extracted from coal, so is not necessarily destroyed by age. It may be that it was present on the 1988 samples, but not detected, or is only present as a contaminent on the Raes and radiocarbon sample.

To be fair to Thibault, he does not claim (unlike yourself, above) that they are. All the white scratchmarks on his negative are clearly visible as non-fluorescent (and therefore non-serum) dark marks on the positive of the UV photo. The marks are less visible in ordinary light because blood inhibits fluorescence, increasing the contrast in a UV photo, but all Thibault’s marks are present on Durante’s photo. They are not easy to identify in Thibault’s paper because of the different scales of the two images, but they’re there if you look.And Mike, try reading the ‘experts’ such as Bucklin, Barbet and Zugibe carefully. They were surgeons, treating the Shroud as a photograph of a dead body. They had no experience of forgery, and were not in a position to decide whether a forger could recreate the wounds or not. Well aware of this, neither Bucklin nor Zugibe commented on whether such a reproduction was possible or not. Barbet thought it impossible, and said so, but Zugibe, in particular, was almost contemptuous of Barbet’s incompetence in a way that even some of his adherents think was extreme.I’m not sure what you mean by “back to square one,” but blandly putting one’s faith in ‘experts,’ however comforting, is no guarantee of the truth.","date":"June 10, 2014 at 4:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/08/conspiracy-theory-part-4/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Conspiracy Theory Part 4"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No, they are not only seen in X-Ray fluorescence, as I explained.

In terms of the standard deviation from the mean, he could be referring to three (99.73% confidence) or even four (99.99%), which in no way contradicts the conclusion of the Nature paper.Stephen goes on to say that the discrepancy between Oxford’s and Arizona’s average dates is inexplicable by normal AMS procedure, but is consistent with his theory that the dates were randomly generated (to cluster around 1325) in all three laboratories. Well no. If the dates were all randomly generated then they would cluster more evenly around the average than they do. It was precisely the non-random distribution of the dates that alerted Remi van Haelst and later Riani & Atkinson to attempt an explanation.Stephen is fascinated by the astonishing accuracy of the Arizona date about 1350, and claims that because the scientists were all nuclear physicists they probably didn’t realise how difficult it is to harvest flax and make it into a sheet in only five years.

Does a nail through the wrist damage the median nerve or not? I don’t know if Bucklin thought the image could be replicated by an artist or not. The words ‘art,’ ‘paint,’ ‘forge’ and all their derivatives do not occur at all in his ‘An Autopsy on the Man of the Shroud.’  Did he ever deny that the shroud could be a forgery? Did Zugibe?If I can take you back to your first comments (back to Square 1, that’s me):a) “Some of the scourge marks (type 3 in Faccini’s paper) have no blood, only serum.” Your evidence for this was Thibault’s paper, which quite clearly shows the opposite.b) “I’d rather follow the expert advice of [Drs Bucklin, Zugibe and Barbet]” But Dr Zugibe and Dr Barbet offer entirely contradictory observations. You cannot follow the expert advice of them both.c) From Barbet: “to describe these imprints as the work of a forger is an attitude which is absurd.” This comment was not repeated by either Bucklin nor Zugibe.d) “I like to respect expert opinion when it’s beyond my scope of practice.” and “Barbet, Zugibe and Buckiln may have differed on some details as do all experts in any field. But they all agreed that this was a crucified man.” The thing they agree on is not at all beyond the scope of anyone’s practice. What is beyond our scope of practice is something they did not all agree to.e) “Art work can easily be pointed out due to the style of the artist.” This may or may not be true, but neither Bucklin nor Zugibe did, in fact, point it out.f) “The shroud looks like a crime scene picture.” It does, doesn’t it, and the only time I have seen similar realistic ‘crime scene pictures’ have been in modern reconstructions of the passion on film. I am fortunate that the nearest I can get to ‘the real thing’ are the scourging and crucifixions regularly carried out every Easter in Mexico and the Philippines, which bear no resemblance to the Shroud at all, in that the scourging seems to produce far more blood than we find on the shroud, and the crucifixion much less.The other details you mention are again, oft quoted but little justified. The ring of bloodstains around the back of the head does not justify a cap of thorns. There is little or no blood between them and the rivulets at the front of the head, perhaps because the Shroud was not in contact with the body there (there is a distinct image gap) or perhaps because the top of the head was not, in fact bleeding at all. Anyway the ringlet of bloodstains looks more as if it was applied on the outer surface of the hair rather than having to seep through from inside. The bloodflow down the arms looks as if it is realistic but probably isn’t, in terms both of the quantity of blood available and the angle of flow as has been interestingly demonstrated by Borrini and Garlaschelli quite recently.There is evidence. There is lots of evidence in favour of a real crucified man leaving his blood and an image on a cloth. But none of it is indisputable, none of it is conclusive and much of it is directly contradictory. That’s fine by me; it is what makes the shroud such a fascinating object.

The bottom line is that in order to achieve a radiocarbon date of 1350 you either have to have material of 1350, or a blend of materials that together give 1350 (barring exotics like nuclear bombardment). If you stipulate that some of that material must be 1st century, then the proportion of material from after 1350 can be easily calculated, and comes to about two-thirds.As I understand it most authenticists accept that this cannot be achieved by Rogers’s gums and dyes, or any kind of cotton fibre contamination floating in from above, but must imply a substantial replacement of the linen threads by new threads. The suggestion is that the new threads were also linen, but can be distinguished from the older ones by a) their vanillin content, b) their cotton intermixture content, and c) their coating of dye. This last has now been discounted as a factor in C14 dating.The problem authenticists have now is to demonstrate how these new threads can be totally invisible to the naked eye, when every thread can be fairly easily followed across various photographs from one side to the other. Invisible mending is obvious under these magnifications, as the new threads lie alongside the old threads for some distance in order for them to have any grip, and there is no sign of it. So we are left with the bizarre “splice” hypothesis, in which old threads and new are unravelled and twisted together (and maybe glued in place), so that when the threads are rewoven there really are no overlapping ends. I say bizarre because this is postulated to have occurred over a length of only a few millimetres, in order to produce a thread which is only a few millimetres longer. The only observed instance of it was by Robert Villarreal, whose thread of only a few millimetres fell apart neatly into two pieces which weren’t ‘spliced’ at all, but simply glued together.","date":"March 24, 2015 at 3:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/22/do-the-blue-quad-mosaics-tell-a-different-story-than-we-think/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Do the Blue Quad Mosaics tell a different story than we think?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“Your calculation of percentages, Hugh, is incorrect.” Dangerous words.

In his lecture at St Louis, Ray Schnieder, with a picture on the screen of the Quad Mosaic, the non-UV-F photo used by Morgan, and one of Morgan’s manipulations, said, “…99.9% for the average date and the UV fluorescence. That’s such a high correlation it strongly suggests that the date was produced by contamination that fluoresced.” Now he seems to be denying that the correlation means anything at all. Now he says: “No conclusion can be drawn from the C14 data with any reliability” and “I think all the data shows the sample to be totally anomalous based on objective data.” Why has he changed his mind? From a 99.9% correlation to no correlation at all. From a “strong” suggestion that “the date was produced by contamination that fluoresced” to no such suggestion at all.And why does he think that “it’s rather funny to then try to spin that into a narrative that the shroud is even younger than it dated. Whatever that is, it isn’t science.” Really? All I did was extract a rigorously logical conclusion from the extraordinary precision of Morgan’s correlation and the detail of his photographic manipulations.  No “try”. No “spin.” No “narrative.” And that is Science.And I’m afraid I disagree with the new conclusion too. The radiocarbon data, including the Nature paper, and Remi van Haelst’s analysis, and Riani and Atkinson’s chronological gradient discovery, are far from meaningless. Statistics is a very adaptable set of tools, as all the statisticians well know.

The two main foundations for my cogitations on the date of the Shroud and in particular the C14 corner are the famous ‘Nature’ paper and Riani & Atkinson’s statistical analysis which appears to demonstrate a chronological gradient across the shroud sample. There is thus room for some variation across the C14 area, which could be caused by the addition of an extraneous substance. To adjust the date from 1st to 13th century requires that most of the C14 sample was from the last few centuries, for which there is no visible evidence even under very high magnification, and very incoherent microscopic evidence. However to establish a chronological gradient over a hundred years or so requires rather less contamination. Any paint, bioplastic coating, surface layer or water soluble contamination (Rogers’s gum) would be removed by the ultrasound, detergent, acic-base-acid cleaning procedure, but I think perhaps Rogers’s dye discovery, adhering rather more integrally to the material, and smeared irregularly across the sample area, could provide the contamination I’m looking for. As I currently reject the reweave idea, I was looking for another reason for a dye being applied to the area when I read comments about the 2002 restoration, where the brightness of the new backing is widely criticised for not fitting the colour of the shroud well enough. I surmised that where the Holland cloth was visible, it might have been smeared with dye shortly after being attached, precisely to mitigate the same problem, and found, in the photograph mentioned above, that the Holland cloth is indeed darker where it is visible than where it is not.","date":"May 22, 2014 at 3:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/documented-pieces-removed-from-the-shroud/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Documented Pieces Removed from the Shroud"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"If the prelates spread their hands out evenly, of course, they would hold it at eight points, and the weight each hand would hold would be even less.","date":"May 21, 2014 at 3:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/documented-pieces-removed-from-the-shroud/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Documented Pieces Removed from the Shroud"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"All good points.As I said above, the textile experts worked from a single not terribly clear photo of a tiny portion of the shroud.

The Holland cloth appears fairly uniformly discoloured where it is exposed, and there is a sharp cut-off between the exposed and the unexposed areas. I would expect sweat-stains to be less uniform. Light, on the other hand, I would expect to bleach the cloth paler, not darker, unless there was a high proportion of lignin in it (like old newspapers). You may remember, however, that I first speculated about this possible dying of the Holland cloth with reference to the high contrast Enrie photos, which seem to show darker areas on the Shroud around the margins of those parts adjoining the Holland cloth.8:59          A repeat of the above.9:04         See my answer above.9:10         Yes, I’m as English as it’s possible to be.9:18         It is indeed my humble opinion, supported only by the evidence I display before you. Scienctists aren’t keen on ‘conclusive scientific facts.’ Non-scientists, on the other hand, often use the term, often as a synonym for ‘guesses.’9:27         “Re ‘threadbareness’, Hugh what you make of (sharp) fingernail pressure per cm2? NOTHING.” You’re quite correct there. I do not consider ‘sharp fingernail pressure’ an avenue worth pursuing. 9:39         I’m certainly not 100% sure there was no repair and no reweaving at all in the C14 sample. However the weave of the shroud can be studied in some detail on Shroud 2.0, the X-ray photos from 1978, and on detailed photos of one of the radiocarbon pieces retained by the Tucson laboratory. No interweaving is detectable, and the continuousness of many of the threads deeply into the body of the Shroud can easily be observed. After examining all the evidence, for and against, I am of the opinion that there is insufficent evidence for a 60% modern intervention to be sustained.                 “Do you seriously think there is not the slightest/foggiest body of evidence to the contrary?” Not at all, and have repeately and publicly said so. There is a lot of interesting but so far inconclusive evidence for reweaving – just not, in my opinion (which I have to say is getting less humble by ther minute), enough to change my mind. Perhaps if the various cotton observers could regularise their ideas into a coherent opinion, I might change my mind.                “Charité bien ordonnée commence par soi-même.” No, you’ve foxed me completely with this one…9:45        “THE other FACT.” “The Shroud was repeatedly sharply bent at both ends each [time] it was stretched for display.” A perfect example of what I suggested in my answer to 9:18 above. Wholly unsubstantiated.10:15      Ray Rogers’s Thermochimica Acta paper describes evidence for madder root dye and some kind of water soluble gum. That’s as close to a “FACT” as you’re likely to come. If the dye was applied to the Shroud, to conceal some invisible weaving, then there wouldn’t be any on the backing coth unless it was attached to the Shroud before the dying process. If the dye was applied to the backing coth to make it look more like the Shroud, then it would have stained the adjacent areas of the Shroud as well. Interestingly, Rogers claims that there was none of his observed coating on his samples of the Holland coth. However, he does not say from where his samples came. Even by my hypothesis, most of the cloth was, of course, completely dye-free.","date":"May 21, 2014 at 10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/documented-pieces-removed-from-the-shroud/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Documented Pieces Removed from the Shroud"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No. As I understand it they based their replies on the difference between the uniformly thick threads on one side of one of the herringbone ‘spines’ and the variably thick threads on the other side.

The first diagram shows, as Rogers captioned it: “A mass spectrum obtained from the pyrolysis of a shroud-image fiber,” and the second ” A mass spectrum from the low-temperature pyrolysis of fibers from a Raes sample.” I do not know why Rogers omitted a temperature qualification from the first diagram. Nevertheless, some comments are valuable.– The first diagram shows an small amount of furfural (Mass 96, about 5 on the y-scale), and a significant amount of hydroxymethylfurfural (Mass 126, about 20 on the y-scale). The presence of both these compounds is attributed to the decomposition of cellulose.– The second diagram shows a significant amount of furfural (Mass 96, about 10 on the y-scale), and no hydroxymethylfurfural (0 on the y-scale). This he attributes to the presence of a significant amount of pentosan.– The implication is that the second diagram shows the composition of the sample at a lower temperature than the sample shown in the first diagram, as it shows no products from the decomposition of cellulose. It would have been better to show the two diagrams as at the same temperature.– The first diagram shows an enormous peak of Mass 131 (Over 100 on the y-scale). The second diagram shows a rather smaller peak (about 35 on the y-scale). Rogers’s only mention of Mass 131 is to say “Incidentally, the pyrolysis/ms spectra of samples from apparent blood spots showed hydroxyproline peaks at mass 131, a pyrolysis product of animal proteins.” Marco Bella is thus surely justified is saying the Rogers “identifies the peak at mass=131 as hydroxyproline, a hypothesized pyrolysis product of animal proteins.” Unless there is another reason for the peak at 131, Thibault’s announcement “It is simply FALSE. Rogers never said that for good reasons” cannot be justified. Perhaps Rogers admitted of a ‘blood spot’ even on an ‘image’ fibre.– The first diagram shows significant peaks (>30 on the y-scale) at Mass 69 and 181. It is a pity that Rogers does not discuss these. The second diagram a succession of decreasing peaks at 56/58, 69/71, 83, and 97 (but note that the x-scale does not go further than 150 on this diagram), which Marco Bello shows is consistent with the decomposition of a hydrocarbon. If these peaks are removed from the second diagram, there is indeed little to distinguish it significantly from diagram one.– It is important to recognise that this article only addresses Rogers’ spectrographical comments, not his chemical tests, and I think Rogers’s supporters are correct to feel that Marco Bello’s final conclusion (“The work of the late Dr. Rogers has been exploited to support a pseudoscientific hypothesis which is in no way confirmed by the reported data.”) is unjustified except in this particular aspect.Moving on a little, OK asks, with some justification “What about cotton? What about dye? What about vanillin?” I have been thinking about the vanillin, and in particular Rogers’s comment regarding its decay: “However, some reasonable storage temperatures can be considered to give a range of predicted ages. If the shroud had been stored at a constant 25°C, it would have taken about 1319 years to lose a conservative 95% of its vanillin. At 23°C, it would have taken about 1845 years. At 20 ◦C, it would take about 3095 years.” These figures were derived by direct extrapolation of his version of the Arrhenius equation as it applies to vanillin. By an exactly similar extrapolation, we find that if the temperature was 140°C it would have taken 2 minutes. This means that if the Shroud were ever in a box which became heated to extent that silver melted, there would be no vanillin present, regardless of how recently it had been made. Even if the Raes sample was actually from a piece of modern cloth, the vanillin evidence from the rest of the Shroud does not permit the conclusion that “the cloth must be quite old.” (Whatever that means!).","date":"September 5, 2015 at 4:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thank you, Carlos. that at least makes sense, although it implies that proteinaceous derivatives should be found all over the body, which Heller and Adler were at at pains to refute.

Uric acid, urea and hydroxyproline are distinct chemicals, and the presence of one does not necessarily imply the presence of the others. Identifying hydroxyproline at any particular point on the Shroud does not demonstrate that it was derived from sweat. It is a breakdown product of many proteins, including blood and collagen. Rogers specifically referred to it possibly deriving from “apparent blood spots.”So although you may be correct that the presence of morbid sweat implies the presence of hydroxyproline, it cannot be said that the presence of hydroxyproline demonstrates the presence of sweat.

He claims he found vanillin in Raes samples and no vanillin in main Shroud samples. As I have explained above, I do not believe that the lack of vanillin demonstrates that the Shroud is older than 1532, but if his Raes threads were genuine (as Thibault has researched), and his Shroud fibres were genuine, and his tests were accurate, then there is something anomalous which needs to be explained. You yourselves might have pointed out that a mass spectrograph for vanillin shows a large peak at Mass 151 and Mass 152 (see: http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C121335&Mask=200), and also that although Rogers showed a full spectrum for his “Shroud” samples, he carefully cut short his “Raes” spectrum at Mass 150.  That would have helped confirm your conclusion, unless perhaps vanillin requires a higher temperature spectrograph than these diagrams show.Another interesting thing is that these two diagrams are also reproduced in “Pyrolysis/Mass Spectrometry Applied to the Shroud of Turin” (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers4.pdf), where both are labelled “low temperature”.","date":"September 6, 2015 at 10:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m not sure what this is about, OK, if you’ll forgive me.

Silver melts at about 900°C. Even though the thermal conductivity of linen is poor, I think the possibility of any part of the Shroud not achieving 140°C for a couple of minutes is remote. Had it done so, all its vanillin would have been destroyed. On the other hand, if the Shroud were not in a box, and not in a fire, but still had a lump of hot silver collapsed onto it, then it would be much more likely to have remained cold in the middle.

Nitowski’s Slide 1BF, referenced above, appears to consist of a single piece of sticky tape cut in two and then reassembled, covered with a coverslip which is itself taped down at the edges.

This suggests that Slide 1BF is one of the “half-tapes” produced by McCrone, further subdivided but then reassembled. Heller and Adler said their tapes were “about 5cm2 in area” (500mm2) which is consistent with their having half an original.Slide 1AB (the second slide referenced above) is a bit of a mystery. It is captioned “Galss [sic – glass?] slide which held original tape sample, removed for testing” but it is important to recognise that the “original tape samples” were not on glass slides, and were cut in two before mounting. (Or were they? Who wrote “1AD (1)” and who else – in red – wrote “McCrone” “E” and “W” and what in this context do East and West mean?).Weird. Did McCrone stick the tapes onto slides first, then label them E and W, and then cut them up and put them on different slides? If 1BF is one of these, why is it not labelled E or W itself? And why was it cut in two and then reassembled?These are tiny details, of the kind daveb usually thinks I make too much of, but they call into question the integrity of almost everything everyone has ever thought they discovered on the surface of the Shroud, given the possibility of contamination as tapes were cut up, stuck down, peeled off and reassembled somewhat at random and without proper record.Did Rogers ever explain to anyone what his numbers meant, and why there were so many missing? The first number seems to refer roughly to areas of the Shroud (although there are some anomalies), and the last to the Back and Front images, but the middle sequences are incomplete.

These last, as someone pointed out, may have been ‘withdrawn’ either before or after testing, after John Jackson’s altercation with Max Frei.I realise this post is both long and somewhat disjointed, but a whole new can of worms is wriggling about, and it’ll be a while before I can make much sense of them!","date":"September 6, 2015 at 4:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Giorgio, I’m not sure I understand this, and hope you will help.

From your comment above, am I right in thinking that it was Dr Kohlbeck who made Slides 37 to 53, and Slides 417 to 434, from Rogers’s two slides 1EB and 6BF respectively? 1EB seems to have been taken from the back of the calf, and is described as image, but it seems that Dr Kohlbeck was able to extract at least two possible ‘blood spots’ from it.However, Dr Nitowski’s paper, as of 1986, lists the possessors of the original Slides as follows: “Rogers has 3 slides, Adler has 22, Levi-Setti has 18, and I have 21, which totals 64. This matches the original 32 which Rogers says he took from the Shroud, which McCrone divided in two.” But this doesn’t make sense, as the slides are never described as, for example, 1EBa and 1EBb, which they might be if there were two (McCrone cut) samples from each original tape. Furthermore, the three slides sent to Rogers were, according to Nitowski, 3BF, 3EF, and 6AF. Is that three original tape samples (six slides) or three of the half samples prepared by McCrone?Anyway, what happened next? How did Rogers get hold of Slides (or half-sample slides) 1EB and 6BF, and what was left of them after Kohlbeck had removed all their contents onto 30 or so new slides?And how did Kohlbeck remove his samples for remounting? Did he peel the tape of the glass and pluck off the fibres, or did he cut through the tape (as, we are told, Frei did with his pollen tapes). If the former, then the chance of new contamination was surely quite high, and if the latter, then what on earth did the original look like after 15 samples had been cut from it?Even more extraordinary is Dr Nitowski, writing years before Rogers claimed to have carried out his observations on his Raes sample, finding, with Dr Kohlbeck, lots of starch and a heavy coating which came away from the fibres beneath. These findings are exactly what Rogers found eight years later, and were communicated to him, but he makes no mention of that at all in his Thermochimica Acta paper, nor of the fact that this thread had been soundly denounced as a fake.I had not read “Criteria for Authentication” until a few moments ago, but it throws a new and murky light on almost all the research carried out on the 1978 Mylar tapes, except possibly the experiments carried out by Heller and Adler – and Walter McCrone who, clumsy though he might have been, at least told everybody what he had done. Even Heller and Adler do not appear to know that the tapes had been cut in two before they received them; they simply say that 36 samples were taken and that they received 22 of them, each about 5cm2 in area. As they were not present at Turin, they might not have known what McCrone had done, and judging by Heller’s comments about Rogers giving away the entire collection to McCrone in the first place, they were no great respecters of Rogers’s competence in material data handling.Can anybody shed any light on all this?","date":"September 5, 2015 at 3:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“it is unjust that “Shroudies” in general will have to pay the price for a blunder committed by a few.” I have no idea what this means.

Neither the paper nor my comments had anything to do with whether a sample is representative or not, except perhaps in the context of the ‘old wood’ effect.So, of course a sample has to be chronologically representative of the object to be dated. Astounding though it seems to authenticists, even non-authenticists can ‘get their heads around’ that. Furthermore, the most detailed examination of the evidence suggesting that the radiocarbon sample was not representative was carried out by myself. Who was the first person to notice that the quad mosaic images have a broad blue band covering the image which demonstrates that the green corners cannot be considered definitive evidence of chemical inconsistency? Who was the first person to notice a video featuring Ray Rogers talking about UV fluorescence, while the camera zoomed meaningfully into a close-up of Jesus’s buttocks, apparently thinking it was the radiocarbon corner? Who was the first person to show that Ray Schneider’s pronouncement at St Louis, saying that there was 99.9% correlation between an alleged UV colour discrepancy and the alleged contamination of the Shroud in fact demonstrated that the contamination made the Shroud appear older, not younger, than it really is? Who was the first person to tabulate the various proportions of cotton found in various threads from the Shroud by various microscopists and show that they were inconsistent? Who was the first person to notice that Jeffrey Skurka’s image purporting to show evidence of a radiocarbon discrepancy was actually taken from a leaflet simply illustrating the procedure? Who is the only person to have suggested that Ray Rogers’s discovery of madder and water-soluble plant gum could be interpreted as anything other than an attempt to make interpolated threads look the same as the original? Who? Yup, moi, from start to finish.And how have I ignored any contradictory evidence? What have I said about Rogers’s vanillin findings? What have I said about Fanti’s mechanical findings? What have I said about the ‘invisible mending’ hypothesis? Right. Now what do we make of all this? There is evidence both in favour of, and against, the possibility that the radiocarbon sample was not representative of the Shroud as a whole. All I have ever declared is that to my mind, the evidence suggesting this is not as compelling as the evidence denying it. There have been, it is true, persistent attempts to change my mind, but they have never produced any other evidence than what I have analysed myself.

This paper raises some interesting questions regarding minor discrepancies in some ancient radiocarbon dating with minimal relevance to Medieval Europe. It is well known that atmospheric C14 varies over time, which is why experimentally derived dates “before present” have to be calibrated against a zig-zag line, derived mostly from tree-ring dating, to produce a calendar date. The authors find that even this does not match radiocarbon findings with accurately known dates in some circumstances, particularly connected with ancient Egyptology, and explore some reasons why. Local variations in atmospheric C14, cause by volcanic eruptions or marine upwelling, for example, and the ‘old wood’ effect, which, by relating the radiocarbon date of part of a long lived tree to the site where it was used for construction, leads to an older than accurate date for an event such as the site’s construction or destruction.However, the thrust of Zerbst and van der Veen’s paper, as exemplified by their last example, that of the discrepancy of 200 years between the radiocarbon and historically accepted dates of the destruction of Nineveh, is not that the radiocarbon date is wrong, but that a serious review of the of the accepted historical date is required.Finally, the last nail in the ‘the carbon dating must be wrong’ aspiration, is that the radiocarbon date discrepancy invariably makes the radiocarbon date older than the calendar date. Although this paper has no relevance whatsoever to the Shroud, if it had, it would demonstrate that the date of manufacture must later than the radiocarbon date, not earlier, and lend credence to the da Vinci hypothesis.","date":"August 23, 2015 at 4:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/22/food-for-thought-an-important-paper-on-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Food for Thought: An Important Paper on Radiocarbon Dating"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I may be wrong, but I don’t think it was the “Jesus was married” bit that Dan was agreeing with; it was the “Of course priests should marry” bit.

It’s a bore, but someone has to do it.– Linick was an extreme anti-authenticist. Jones puts forward no evidence for this. He is looking for a refusal to accept authenticity, even if the shroud were proved 1st century. His quote from Linick does not support this. Linick says that proving the shroud to be first century “leaves room for argument” and “it would be the right age, but is it the real thing?” This is not a refusal to accept authenticity – it could very well be a rhetorical question posed by an authenticist, who might then go on to demonstrate that the answer is yes.– Linick was probably aware of McCrone’s prediction that the Shroud’s carbon date would be “about 1355.” Jones puts forward no evidence for this. His comparison of Jones’s rhetorical question with McCrone’s assumption that a 1st century shroud would be accepted as genuine by nearly everyone is specious. But so what? Dozens of people could have read McCrone’s predictions, as they were published years previously. Even if he hadn’t read McCrone’s work, the range of likely dates, either 1st century or 13th-14th century, was obvious to everybody.– Linick was the leaker of Arizona’s “1350” first date of the Shroud. Jones puts forward no evidence for this. He claims that for Sox simply to quote’s Linick’s rhetorical question above is “proof beyond reasonable doubt that Linick was the leaker.” Well, it isn’t, is it?– Linick was found dead of suspected suicide on 4 June 1989. Jones puts forward no evidence for this. His death, according to the obituary by Timothy Jull, was “untimely,” and according to Bruno Bonnet Eymard, was “in unclear circumstances.” This is not evidence of suicide, nor of murder. A Vatican insider article in 2013 claims suicide, but gives no reference. This is an unwarranted escalation of suggestion; it is not evidence. Jones is unable to find published information on Linick’s death in Arizona (a ‘closed record’ state). Had he tried a common genealogy program he would have found trhat Linick’s death was registered in California, not Arizona.Jones’s next three points are less controversial: Linick was a measurement scientist, the AMS apparatus required a program to assess its results, and there were six weeks between the cutting of the sampels and the radiocarbon dating in Arizona. None of it, of course, is evidence for any Soviet plot.After that, we discover that Jones’s allegations were sent, by me, without his permission, to Timothy Jull and Christopher Ramsey, who lied in their responses. For what it’s worth I also sent the Arizona laboratory a large chunk of Part 1 of Jones’s allegations, and have now sent them and Prof. Ramsey a substantial part of these latest libels. I do not need a libeller’s permission to report his libels to the people he is libelling, nor does his pitiful plea of copyright cut any ice with me.","date":"July 5, 2014 at 2:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/05/stephen-jones-continues-his-computer-hacking-conspiracy-theory/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","title":"Stephen Jones  Continues his Computer Hacking Conspiracy Theory"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’ve asked the AMS lab at Arizona University if they’d like to comment. Meanwhile, can I look at Stephen’s often mentioned statistic from Harry Gove: “The other question that has been asked is: if the statistical probability that the shroud dates between 1260 and 1390 is 95%, what is the probability that it could date to the first century? The answer is about one in a thousand trillion, i.e. vanishingly small.” I don’t think Stephen understands how this was calculated, or why it is not applicable the other way round. It is a purely statistical calculation, relating to the variability of the results of the radiocarbon measurement, and is meaningless if taken literally. Harry Gove meant it as an esoteric joke.Suppose, for the sake of example, that five people count a flock of sheep. They return with the figures 63, 67, 61, 65 and 64. What, asks a statistician, is the probability that there are in fact only 4 sheep in the field? To anybody (even a statistician) the answer is none whatever, but statistically the answer is not zero, and is calculable. The Standard Deviation of the figures is 2.24, and 4 sheep is about 27 Standard Deviations (SD) from the Mean. The chances of a number being less than 1SD is about 16%, less than 2SD is about 2.3%, and less than 3SD is about 0.2%. I can’t find a table that lists the probability of a number less than 27SD; it is both “vanishingly small” and also, significantly, not zero.This was Harry Gove’s calculation for the Turin Shroud. The Mean and Standard Deviation for the radiocarbon dates was known, and the first century was sufficient Standard Deviations away for the statistical probability to be one in a thousand trillion or so. Of course, years, like sheep, are discrete objects, and not infinitely divisible like numbers, so the number is meaningless; Gove meant it as a joke, of course. Stephen seems to take it seriously, ignoring the fact that any year selected randomly between 4 billion BC and the present has a quarter of a million times better chance of being correct than one in a thousand trillion.","date":"May 24, 2014 at 1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/24/stephen-jones-the-kgb-allegedly-executed-both-shroud-of-turin-hackers/","cat":"hacking","title":"Stephen Jones: The KGB allegedly executed both Shroud of Turin Hackers"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Ah!

But as I have said before; if this stuff is not discussed, then it can be taken as approved of, which I don’t. Stephen’s chart showing the non-overlapping ranges of the averages of the laboratories’ dates is wrong. He has blithely assumed that BP dates can be converted into AD dates simply by subtracting them from 1950, which is wrong to start with, but also he has not taken into account a particular anomaly in the calibration curve during the 13th century, whereby, for example, a BP date of 650 can indicate an AD date of either 1300 or 1375, but not 1325-1350. Properly calibrated, all three labs’ dates overlap, although it is true that Oxford’s overlaps the other two the least. The Arizona and Zurich samples overlap considerably more than indicated by Jones’s simplistic treatment.Although Riani & Atkinson have demonstrated a statistical chronological gradient across the sample, which may be due to minor contamination to an increased degree, but in no way invalidates the radiocarbon dates, and provides good evidence that the 12 BP dates produced by the labs were not randomly variant about 1325 as Jones suggests, and thus not randomly generated by a computer program. As it happens 1325AD corresponds to a BP date of almost exactly 600, so one would expect random numbers to cluster around that figure.Paradoxically, just as there is only a 5% chance that the Oxford and Arizona dates represent exactly the same age of cloth, so there is only a 5% chance of achieving the same result using a random number generator. If Jones is wedded to his spy theory, then he must accept that there is no discrepancy between the radiocarbon dates, in which case there is no need to explain their innacuracy by means of a random number generator!","date":"June 13, 2014 at 11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/13/the-beat-goes-on/","cat":"hacking","title":"The Beat Goes On"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Where are Dr Nitowski and Dr Levi-Setti’s collection of Shroud sample tapes now?","date":"September 6, 2015 at 10:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Stop Press: A little while ago Stephen either read this blog, or someone told him of the post above, and he inserted a comment into his latest posting to the effect that he realised his dates and chart with its non-overlapping bands were based on BP dates and needed calibrating. This he has now done, and amended his blog to show a new set of dates and a new chart which, curiously, still shows that the Oxford dates do not overlap either of the others. By using the tiny calibration diagram published in the Nature paper rather than an established calibration program, he has enabled himself to reinforce his convictions. This cannot be allowed to go uncriticised.It is not clear that Stephen really understands the calibrating process, particularly when it comes to how to deal with quoted errors. Actually anybody can do it by using OxCal, which is online, easy to access, easy to use, and free. Stephen tried to do it using the tiny published calibration chart in the Nature paper, deriving his dates simply by adding and subtracting the error from the mean as published in the Nature paper, and attempting to read off the calendar date.His results, and those from OxCal (to 95.4% probability) are as follows:Arizona BP dates:     646 ± 31Stephen’s calibration:     1290 – 1317OxCal’s calibration:     1281 – 1396Oxford BP dates:     750 ± 30Stephen’s calibration:     1214 – 1266OxCal’s calibration:     1222 – 1287Zurich BP dates:     676 ± 24Stephen’s calibration:     1286 – 1293OxCal’s calibration:     1275 – 1388Well, it’s only a few years here and there, what does it matter?

Bruno Bonnet-Eymard, of course, does think that the samples were deliberately switched, but his evidence is tenuous and circumstantial.That takes us to Benford, Marino and Rogers, who without doubting the genuineness of the samples or the integrity of the tests, have to establish that between 70% and 90% of the tested material was interpolated into the shroud, in such a way as to be invisible to the naked eye. This is far from established on a number of counts, of which I will address two.1) In their “Evidence for the skewing of the C14 Dating” paper (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf), Benford and Marino present a diagram of where they think a patch was attached.However, this would only produce the required dates if the 12 sub-samples actually tested were cut in ribbons from top to bottom of the original same strip. If the samples were cut ‘horizontally,’ then one would expect some dates to be entirely 16th century, some to be entirely 1st century, and only, possibly, a middle one to be a mixture of the two. As we know, a substantial portion of the Tucson sample was not dated at all, but retained. The dated fractions would therefore be almost entirely 16th or 1st, with no intermediates. We also know that the Zurich sample was first cut horizontally into two pieces, and then these two further divided. The dates obtained by the Zurich labs do not match a “patch” scenario.A refinement of the “patch” scenario is the “interweaving” scenario. In this case the repair is not hypothesised to be a patch replacing a hole, but a replacement of up to 90% worn out threads across the entire sample area, leaving only a few (between 3 in ten and 1 in ten) of the original threads behind. It is not clear what the extent of this interweaving beyond the sample area might be.2) It must be noted that the huge amount of 16th century or later material cannot be from additions (paint, glue, bacteria) to the cloth, as this was thoroughly disposed of by the cleaning procedure; it must come from the replacement threads themselves. There are various theories about these threads: they are all made of 16th century cotton, they are made of 16th century cotton interspersed with 16th century linen, or they are 16th century cotton interspersed with 1st century linen. Sadly, nobody has been able to study more than a handful of these threads, and what they have found is inconclusive. Rogers (http://www.shroud.it/ROGERS-3.PDF), Heimburger (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part1.pdf) and Fanti (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/fantir7appendix.pdf) all found cotton mixed with linen. The question is, whether the proportion of cotton to linen is sufficiently different between the C-14 area threads and the rest to show that the two are different. Rogers doesn’t say what the proportion of cotton to linen was in his selection. Heimburger studied a 1cm Raes length of thread extensively, and concluded: “R7 [the thread he studied] is definitely some kind of blended thread: cotton (10%-20%)/linen (80%-90%).” Fanti studied about 0.5mm of a thread extracted from the C-14 area and concluded: “The relatively small percentage of cotton fibres of (4/188=) 2.1% is in agreement with the hypothesis that cotton was a contaminant in the ambient where linen threads were prerared.” Mysteriously, Villarreal (http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm) conducted FTIR experiments on three similar threads, one of which was purported made of two ends stuck together with glue (for some reason sometimes referred to as a splice), and found they were all cotton. These three conclusions appear inconsistent. The main body of the cloth appears to contain traces of cotton, noticed by McCrone, Maloney and even Rogers, but as far as I know no-one has quantified it.I agree wholeheartedly that the unconditional acceptance of the C-14 date is not the mark of a ‘true scientist,’ but submit that the unconditional rejection of it is even less so.","date":"August 9, 2013 at 9:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/08/how-can-any-true-scientist-unconditionally-defend-the-c14-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"How can any true scientist unconditionally defend the C14 dating?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks, OK, for your analysis.Aa) The average weight of the shroud. I can’t find when this was established. When was the shroud weighed – and how? Presumably it was during the 2002 restoration, after the patches and backing cloth were removed. Was it rolled up and weighed then? Or is the rather precise mg/cm2 number an over-precise conversion of what was originally not much more than a guess, based on the overall weight and size of the whole thing?Ab) Never mind. Accepting the average weight of the shroud for a moment, the C-14 sample is supposed to be of more than 50% heavier material than the rest of it. What does this mean in terms of an invisible reweave? That the threads are much closer together – no, because this would be clearly visible. That the threads are much thicker – no, because this would be clearly visible (and anyway Benford & Marino specifically point to what they think are thinner interpolations on the Zurich sample). That the admixture of cotton significantly increases the density of the thread – no, because flax fibres have a density of about 1.45g/cm3 while cotton fibres have a density of about 1.55g/cm3.Ac) My explanation for the anomaly is the inaccuracy of the quoted mass of the whole shroud, coupled to local variations in weave density. Can you account for the increased density of the C-14 area?1) I don’t know what visual difference there would be between 16th and 1st century thread. I was arbitrarily assuming that there was some! Does that sound unscientific? Let’s have another try. Rogers thought he had discovered that the interpolated material had been dyed in order to match the colour of the shroud. I think it unlikely that the two colours would match so perfectly as to be indistinguishable, even under a microscope. Apart from that, new thread might be visibly thicker/thinner, looser/denser or even rougher/smoother. A demonstration that 15 of the Schwortz sample threads look different from the rest would be convincing, but I don’t find that.2) The banding seems clear right the way across the photos. Are you suggesting a patch over, say, 20cm wide and high? Only that would account for the uninterrupted stripes that are clearly observable.3) No again. Remi van Haelst and Riani & Atkinson demonstrate inconsistencies in the statistical analyses which are perfectly valid. However, to suggest that that means that no information at all can be derived from the radiocarbon results is absurd. Assuming that the raw data is acceptable, and at no point do our statisticians dispute that, a collection of 12 independent dates between 1200 and 1400 cannot be rejected with a simple, “It could be from the 1st century, it could be from the 11th century.” Statistically, that’s an imprecision vastly more unlikely than the precision quoted by the Nature paper.4) In this case, you don’t have to distinguish between threads of different ages; you simply have to show a bit of anomalous weaving, where two threads run alongside each other for a few millimetres, as the new thread is woven into the pattern. As I say, there must be hundreds of places where that happens.","date":"August 11, 2013 at 5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/08/how-can-any-true-scientist-unconditionally-defend-the-c14-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"How can any true scientist unconditionally defend the C14 dating?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"That’s interesting. Gilbert Raes’s measurement comes from his tiny fraction of the shroud which he extrapolated to the whole thing and which, according to the patch hypothesis, was only partly composed of original shroud anyway. Verginio Timossi’s measurement comes from a copy of the shroud, not the original at all. RA Morris estimated the density of the Shroud from Compton scatter, again not by actually weighing the shroud, and gave a combined shroud/backing density of 30-40mg/cm2. Dividing this proportionately between the measured thickness for the backing and shroud (270/345) gave  about 20mg/cm2 for the shroud and 15mg/cm2 for the backing, although Schwalbe & Rogers considered the shroud value too low, considering “the comparatively open weave structure of the backing cloth.” I can’t find where Riggi gets his estimate from. The fact remains that nobody at all has ever actually weighed the shroud, with or without its backing cloth. Freer-Waters & Jull examined a fragment of the C-14 sample weighing 12.39mg. Their piece was photographed, with a scale, by Barrie Schwortz, and can be accurately measured as about 56 square millimetres. That makes a C-14 density of 22mg/cm2. That corresponds well with the overall calculated density in the paragraph above, but is in distinct disagreement with your 36.89mg/cm2, or even the Paris 1989 reported measurements (8.1 x 1.6 cm, weight 0.497g; density : 38.3mg/cm2). However, Brian Walsh disputes these measurements. Riani and Atkinson, using Walsh’s figures, give an original size of 8.1 x 2.1 cm, which would give a density of 29.2mg/cm2, and a trimmed size of 8.1 x 1.6 cm, which would give a C-14 density of 23.1 mg/cm2. All in all I do not find any of these figures sufficiently well established to agree that the C-14 sample has a different density from the rest of the shroud.Finally, I suspect that shroud cloth has local density variations all over. They are artefacts of the properties of the original hanks of thread of which it is made, and do not indicate patches of interweaving.","date":"August 11, 2013 at 1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/08/how-can-any-true-scientist-unconditionally-defend-the-c14-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"How can any true scientist unconditionally defend the C14 dating?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, I follow your reasoning. 70% of the Carbon dating area must be 16th century or later. That’s all the weft and nearly half the warp threads, or maybe 7/10 of both.So, 1) Try examining Barrie Schwortz’s photos at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/arizona.pdf. The piece photographed contains about 45 threads. If the interweave theory is correct, around 30 are new and 15 old. Can you identify which are which? Can invisible weaving really be that invisible?2) The next photo that needs examining closely is the x-ray of the foot of the cloth in http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf. (Figure 7). It is poorly reproduced here, but very clearly in Schwalbe & Rogers, Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin. There is continuous warp and weft banding right through the C-14 area, and no evidence of interpolated threads, although Benford and Marino, using a very poor copy in their paper, think they see one ‘break’ in one ‘intensity’ line.3) Next, the actual dates of the Damon Nature paper have never been queried by statisticians, let alone massacred. The best analysis of the data is by Riani, Atkkinson et al, who do demonstrate, using the data which they do not query, that there is indeed a clear chronological progression along the sample area. This accounts very well for the anomalous chi-squared value and its 5% significance, and does indeed suggest contamination, but it does nothing to suggest that any part of the sample area is from the 1st century.4) Finally, however invisible mending is carried out, it results in the new threads running alongside the old threads for some distance as they merge. Sadly I don’t have the much touted Shroud App, as I don’t have an iPad, but if the HD image is as clear as they say, it will surely be possible to examine the area around the C-14 excision and post a screen grab showing these parallel weavings.

I think Pam has argued her case as well as possible, and I like the reconstructions of the radiocarbon corner (so similar to my own, dear reader, as you will recall…)However, among the throwaway remarks upon which some of the rest of the paper depends is this, in the second paragraph of page 2: “The Holland cloth at A was covered by a patch (see detail) which had been removed before this photograph was taken.” I don’t believe this is true. I have never heard that a patch was sewn on over the Holland cloth between 1978 and 1988, and the X-Ray photos of 1978 most definitely show no patch, so where did that idea come from?The second paragraph of page 4, and an accompanying illustration, drags in the Quad Mosaics again. “There is a density of colour in the fabric taken for radiocarbon date in Barrie Schwortz’s image and the unusual dark green in the corner of the Quad Mosaic is not seen elsewhere on the Shroud.” Actually the unusual dark green is seen in almost every corner of each of the four mosaics, or at least a colour so similar that a picture of the dorsal torso was mistaken for the picture of the ventral legs in a documentary devoted to that very subject.Part of the point of the paper is that a dye was rubbed onto the ‘mended’ Shroud in order to match the colours. Well it was a pretty poor shot, wasn’t it, since the dye is, according to both Rogers and Pam, so conspicuously different from the cloth it was supposed to emulate.At the top of page 6 Rogers is quoted as saying, “17) The colored encrustation does not seem to stick to linen as well as cotton. Some linen fibers appear to be nearly clean, but the cotton fibrils can be heavily encrusted in the same thread sample. This suggests that the cotton was added to the Raes threads to make dyeing possible. The cotton in the threads would have made color matching easier. Linen is difficult to dye or stain.” I think this last sentence is naive. Dyed linen is perfectly common. Linen may be more difficult to dye than cotton, but that’s a relative term. Furthermore, ‘encrustations’ are not evidence of dye. Dye, as Teresinha Roberts points out on page  10, is irrevocably bonded to the fibres of the material being dyed. Encrustations are easily removed.The bottom of page 6 shows one of the Raes threads, which, it is claimed “is a splice of linen and cotton held together with a terpene crust.” I don’t think this is the same thread which Villarreal claimed was that. Either way, it is not a splice but an end-to-end joint, which has no structural strength whatever. “One end of the yarn is a different colour to the other.” I disagree. I think the colour here is an artefact of the lighting.On page 2 and page 7 Pam notices that the dye has penetrated both the radiocarbon corner and the Holland cloth adjacent and underneath it. This is in contradiction of Rogers’ Thermochimica Acta paper, page 191, “There was absolutely no coating with these characteristics on either the Holland cloth or the main part of the shroud.” It was this observation that led me to abandon a hypothesis I put forward almost two years ago, on this site (Cat among the Pigeons, 14 Jan 2014): “Disappointingly, I cannot find a picture of the radiocarbon corner, including the backing cloth, taken after the sample was cut, but before the Holland cloth was replaced. Can anyone help? [I found one later – the ones Pam uses.]Because I predict (dangerous), that the area that had been concealed under the radiocarbon sample area will be as white as the area that had been under the Raes sample area.How to explain this? Was something smeared over that corner, and, for that matter, the burn holes as well, after the shroud had been stitched to the Holland cloth, to try to make the colours more uniform? Did it include a mixture of madder root dye and gum arabic? And was it applied with a cotton pad? Are shreds of cotton, dyed with madder and glued down with gum arabic, found along the edges of the shroud adjacent to the Holland cloth – including the edges of the burn holes?It’s new, it’s revolutionary, and you read it here first, folks!”Later on page 10, Rogers is quoted as saying that: “Ray Roger’s experiments with fibres from the Raes sample showed that the dye was removed with 6N HCl and the gum with concentrated HCl. The processes from Arizona, Oxford and Zurich are reproduced below and none of the laboratories used sufficient concentration of HCl to remove the dye or the gum.” While the above is perfectly true, Rogers also said that the gum was soluble in water, and all the cleaning processes used by the three laboratories were certainly capable of doing that.Finally, it is implied that the dye could have substantially affected the radiocarbon date. (e.g. page 1: “The dye which was not removed by the pre-cleaning of the samples invalidates the carbon date results.” Well, no it doesn’t. It may slightly affect the radiocarbon results (and according to Ray Schneider’s St Louis presentation it makes the Shroud appear older than it actually is), but it certainly doesn’t invalidate them.All this from a rather quick first reading of the paper.

Once dyed, the dye is part of the cloth and cannot be removed. Any encrustations, including undissolved bits of dye, mordant or whatever, are not bound to the cloth and are easily removed by theradiocarbon cleaning regime.

However, I would still like a couple to be addressed, especially the one about Rogers insisting that there was no dye or gum on the Holland cloth. As you know, I originally attributed Rogers’s ‘dye’ not to any attempt to match new Shroud fibres with old, but to match the Holland cloth to the Shroud, just in the corners where pieces of the Shroud had been cut off, and possibly, although I don’t know how to check this, where it was visible through various unpatched holes. The dye, I thought, might have been smeared on, and some of it smeared onto the Shroud itself. But Rogers was quite positive that there was no dye on the Holland cloth. Pam’s paper suggests that she disagrees with this. It may be that Rogers only looked at Holland cloth threads from underneath the Shroud (the Raes corner in particular), where no dye had made contact.The other point is that although the gum was hydrolysed by concentrated HCl, it did not require hydrolysis to remove it; water was entirely sufficient, as the gum dissolved in water.Another point that occurs to me is the contradistinction found in this paragraph:17) The colored encrustation does not seem to stick to linen as well as cotton. Some linen fibres appear to be nearly clean, and the cotton fibrils can be heavily encrusted in the same thread sample. This suggests that cotton was added to the Raes threads to make dyeing possible. The cotton in the threads would have made color matching easier. Linen is difficult to dye or stain.”Surely this is evidence that the linen had actually absorbed the dye into it, while the cotton still had lumps of it sticking on the top, not penetrating the fibrils, and easy to remove.

This is the viewpoint of “Whips and Angels, Painting on Cloth in the Medieval Period” by Linnet Kestrel, and “Medieval Painted Flags, A Study” by Rebecca Robynson, both of whom think that gesso was omitted altogether in these circumstances. Cennino Cennini himself, the earliest source of medieval techniques, discusses movable cloth in Chapters 163 (curtains), 165 (flags) and 173 (including skirts) of “Il Libro dell’ Arte o Tratato della Pittura” and is a little less clear, but it is certainly not obvious that gesso was involved. In his advice for preparation of linen generally, however, he suggests applying gesso and them immediately scraping it all off again, as if to leave particulate gesso glued among the threads of the cloth, and that might have resulted in a flexible ground, and is probably the technique you are thinking of. I do not know how crumbly this would be when rolled or folded. If there is, or was gesso, on the Shroud, and if that gesso was made of calcium carbonate (it should be remembered that ‘gesso’ is simply Italian for ‘gypsum’, which is calcium sulphate as used by the Italians, so was somewhat inexactly used by non-Italians to describe a treatment for cloth using calcium carbonate), then it could be in any crushed form of limestone (calcite or aragonite), marble, or more probably chalk.","date":"December 14, 2015 at 5:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/09/important-new-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-samples/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Important New Paper on the Carbon Dating Samples"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think the piece Charles is referring to is linen, made probably in Italy, about 1350-1400, Museum number: 8615-1863.","date":"December 14, 2015 at 9:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/09/important-new-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-samples/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Important New Paper on the Carbon Dating Samples"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Sorry, I think I misunderstood your question.

If the different colours represent different chemical compositons, then the entire shroud is divided into seveal bands of very different composition, without considering the green corners.2) If the disputed UV photo is genuine, then the Holland cloth under the shroud (and which was under the Raes sample before being cut off) fluoresces brightly. The exposed bits of the Holland cloth (the missing corners and the burn holes at the end of the cloth) do not fluoresce at all. Their fluorescence has been effectively smothered – by what?3) The cotton question is significant, but without some agreement as to how much there is and whether it is spun into the threads, woven into the cloth or merely surface contamination it doesn’t lead anywhere.4) I think the exposed Holland cloth and other holes were dyed to match the shroud, which dye accounts for the difference in colour on the shroud around these areas. I do not think the dye significantly affects the radiocarbon dating.5) There is insufficient evidence about the vanillin to determine whether it is significant or not.6) The radiocarbon corner was heavily attached onto the Holland cloth. The holes for the sewing are still clearly visible.

However, as in this case I had only recently proposed my claim, I hoped it would not be necessary to re-quote all my observations in detail.Claim: “We can say with authority than any contamination of the radiocarbon corner of the shroud made it appear older, not younger, than it really is.” This is based on John M. Morgan III’s paper ‘Digital image processing techniques demonstrating the anomalous nature of the radiocarbon dating sample area of the Shroud of Turin’ at http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380798975_Morgan.pdf, where he shows that the radiocarbon samples are increasingly contaminated the closer they are to the corner, and on Ray Schneider’s St Louis paper, ‘Dating The Shroud Of Turin: Weighing All The Evidence’ at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlschneiderpaper.pdf, where he shows a 99.93% correlation between the radiocarbon dates and the UV-fluorescence.Claim: “There is no visible evidence, at any magnification, either of the enormous contamination or the enormous interweaving which would be necessary to discredit the radiocarbon date.” I don’t believe anyone disputes that massive contamination would be necessary to convert a 1st century date into a medieval one. None of Donna Campbell’s investigation in to the Oxford samples, or of Freer-Waters’s investigation into a reserved piece of the Tucson sample, show anything like the contamination required. Campbell’s conclusion is a model of professional restraint, and the closest she can get to evidence for the massive contamination required is a mention of the discrepancy in the spacing of the threads, which “could suggest the use of different yarns.” And of course I noted the discovery of cotton fibres by the Oxford lab. I’ve no doubt all the labs discovered all sorts of things covering their samples; that’s why they examined them microscopically and cleaned them with ultra-sound and vacuum-pipettes. Similarly, nothing in Rogers of any of the LANL scientists’ finding comes even remotely close to the 65/35 modern/ancient proportions required for the job.If there has ever been any serious photographic evidence that more than 60% of the radiocarbon corner or any other part of the shroud was not original material, I have yet to see it, and I’m afraid you have too.","date":"March 21, 2015 at 6:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/20/john-klotz-delivers-the-knockout/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"John Klotz Delivers the Knockout"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No. Apart from getting your first max and min muddled, you have ignored the error bars and the calibrations.For the Shroud:The earliest Arizona date works out at 1259 AD, and the latest 1412 AD, a difference of 153 years.The earliest Oxford date works out at 1044 AD, and the latest 1388 AD, a difference of 344 years.The earliest Zurich date works out at 1167 AD, and the latest 1412 AD, a difference of 245 years.I won’t bother to check the control samples, but the range may not be as suspicious as you think!","date":"October 23, 2013 at 2:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/23/jones-none-of-the-three-laboratories-dated-its-sample-to-between-1260-and-1390/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Jones:  “none of the three laboratories dated its sample to between 1260 and 1390”"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Oh, I agree with that.

However, the STuRP team did not extract any threads, only fibres, on their sticky tapes, which must obviously have come from the surfaces of the threads. Maloney does not say how he knows about the the inside of the ‘main body’ threads.2) I found it very interesting that “all of the implications” were that the position from which the radiocarbon sample was to come was the Raes corner as early as November 1987. I wonder what Riggi and Gonella argued about on the morning of the cutting!3) Another interesting point concerns the attaching of new threads when old ones run out, particularly with reference to the Egyptian cloth (Figure 7, Page 25, and the diagram on Page 26). There is no way that the photos on Pages 12 (Figure 7) and 15 can be ‘splices’ in any recognised sense of the world. Any attempt to unravel the ends of two submillimetre threads by a few mm and then to reravel them together in such a way that they do not come apart (which is what a splice is) would be wholly fruitless, and in this case I do not even believe they are two ends of different threads anyway.","date":"December 21, 2014 at 6:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/19/just-published-what-went-wrong-with-the-radiocarbon-date/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Just Published:  What Went Wrong with the Radiocarbon Date?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Why?

The authors find that their radiocarbon dating of old peat bogs was improved by treating their macrofossils in glycerine-thymol-ethyl alcohol mixture, and then rinsing them with alcohol. They say: “The interesting fact is that most of the dates from the Skaliska Basin carried out from macrofossils treated by a mixture of glycerine, thymol and ethyl alcohol (but pretreated by rinsing them in alcohol) reflected a reliable age in comparison with that deduced from palynological analysis. The aforementioned observations give a far-reaching possibility of dating profiles investigated in the past, from which macrofossils have already been identified and collected (and thus preserved in glycerine-thymol-ethyl alcohol mixture).” They clearly do not think that even ancient (3000 BC) material is likely to be ruined from a radiocarbon dating point of view by preserving it in thymol, so 2000 year old material would be even less so.

It is a piece of imaging software which self-organises areas of similar data into areas of the same colour. In this case gradually increasing density of colour has been organised into stripes, rather like coloured contours on relief maps. Wikipedia explains k-means clustering quite well.Furthermore, I dispute that the density of colour is directly related to contamination density. It is at least partly, and perhaps mainly, related to the intensity of the light shining on that area, and probably also to the angle at which the light is reflecting.Finally, if these photos do in fact indicate contamination, then the more the contamination, the older the Shroud appears. This could perhaps be due to a mineral oil being an important part of it: mineral oil has a C14 content of zero, and I understand is particularly difficult to remove from radiocarbon samples. If Rogers’s dye, which I think was actually smeared onto the Holland cloth and only incidentally spread over onto the Shroud, contained a mineral oil component, that might explain the anomaly. Although it might explain the chronological gradient across the samples, it can have had no significant effect on measurement of the date of the Shroud.","date":"March 27, 2015 at 5:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"What a terrible mistake. I am no more nor less committed to non-authenticity than before, and anyway for me, the question of authenticity or not is not very important. The Church is littered with relics which may or not be authentic, such as the nails, the thorns or the robes, and it makes no difference to her whether or not they are genuine, or whether they are as the Pope so eloquently put it ‘icons’ which encourage deeper involvement with the life of Christ.So why have I suddenly come across all aggressive? It is because although I have a great respect for real evidence for authenticity, it does the authenticist case no good when they promote evidence which is clearly wrong, or says the opposite of that intended. Ray says the observed contamination in Morgan’s paper affects the age of the Shroud. Well, if that’s true then the contamination makes the Shroud older, not younger. Max says all his contamination does not amount to twice the mass of the substrate. Well if that’s true then the medieval date is correct. Fortunately, Ray has now rephrased his remark ideas, and Max will come up with some explanation soon, I’ve no doubt.If you read my comment above you will find that I am not rejecting the possibility of the radiocarbon date being wrong, but trying to find a way in which it might be so. I have even tried to explain how the surface contamination might have been responsible for the age/contamination gradient being the “wrong way round.” Nobody else has. The Quad Mosaics, UV-F photos and surface contamination all being rejected, what are you left with? Substantial replacement of material. Now I must try to find evidence for that, since it is clear that few actual authenticists (Thibault perhaps being a notable exception) will.

I have examined the Quad Mosaic photographs, the alleged UV-F photographs, the Morris manipulations of the alleged UV-F photographs, Barrie Schwortz’s transmitted light photographs and his close-ups of the retained Arizona sample, the Oxford Accelerator Unit’s photographs of their sample before it was destroyed, Morris’s X-Ray photographs, Shroud Scope, Shroud 2.0, and the black-and-white enlargement of the Raes sample. I have read everything Sue Benford, Joe Marino, Ray Rogers, Robert Villarreal, Remi van Haelst, Thibault Heinburger, Riani et al. and Uncle Tim Cobbley have written on the subject.

Nor, as far as I know, has anybody else.Now for the (long-awaited) answers to your questions, which, if you’ll allow me, I shall rephrase to make them more sensible, 1) Did anybody examine the radiocarbon sample at high magnification, before or after it was cut? As far as I know, only the scientists at the radiocarbon laboratories themselves, although the photos of the reserved Arizona sample taken by Barrie and the photos of the tested sample taken by the Oxford laboratories are now available to anybody.2) Did Mechthild Flury-Lemberg examine the radiocarbon sample at all? Not as far as I know.3) Have I examined the radiocarbon sample at all? Only from the published photos referred to above.3) Is there any evidence of substantial interweaving outside the radiocarbon sample? No.4) Is there any evidence of substantial interweaving within the radiocarbon sample? Not on the photographs described above.5) Could substantial interweaving be present but invisible on the photographs described above? No. Every thread is easily followed from one side to the other.6) Could truly invisible interpolation have occurred on the Shroud? Yes.

I agree I am being generous, However, I’m not clear that anybody studied the radiocarbon area with a microscope while it was still part of the cloth. Perhaps Thibault can tell us more about “In 1988, the textile experts looked at this area with binocular microscopes.” When did they do that? Was it during the hours of argument between Gonella and Riggi leading up to the actual cutting? And Flury-Lemberg, as far as I know, did not have microscopic access to the Shroud until 2002, long after the sample itself had gone.As for invisible mending, I agree that to my knowledge nobody has ever carried out the procedure I described, namely the unravelling of individual threads, merging them by bringing the unravelled threads together, and then twisting them back up together again to produce a true spliced extended thread. I also think that this would need an unravelling of at least 1-2cm of each thread, which is why it would be impossible to produce such a splice wholly within the radiocarbon sample area. However, I believe that if anybody actually did that, then it could be invisible even under a microscope. In fact, of course, all the “invisible mending” techniques currently used actually rely simply on lying new threads alongside old ones, which is clearly visible under a microscope, or by simply twisting two threads together (illustrated in one of Sue Benford’s papers), without unravelling them, which is also visible under a microscope.What I am doing here is bending over backwards to help those who think the radiocarbon dating is wrong to find an area of investigation which might help them justify their case, all other possibilities having been found wanting, either by consisting of insufficient contamination or by not having evidence of their existence at all.“I’m sorry but your usual prudence has abandoned you in this occasion.” Not at all; my prudence has excelled itself!","date":"April 3, 2015 at 3:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi Louis; I’ve been able to access your link now.

There are many on this blog who think that the radiocarbon dating is correct. We will not defend this conclusion in the face of any convincing evidence to the contrary, but so far, such evidence had not been forthcoming.“Professor Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place.” He did indeed. And he removed them, in case they were contaminants.“The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin.” Possibly. Quite so. And possibly not.“It may have been used for repairs.” Possibly. Although the greater the probability that it was used for repairs, the smaller the probability that it was of Egyptian origin.“Or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.’ Yes, indeed, it may be contemporaneous with the weaving of the Shroud, medieval or first century.” [Gilbert Raes] deduced that this was a strong indication of Middle Eastern manufacture.” Did he? What did he actually say? ‘In view of these observations, one can say that we have no precise indication permitting us to affirm with certainty that the fabric does not date from the time of Christ. It is, however,equally true that there is nothing that would permit us to state that the manufacture of this fabric was effected in that period.’ Equally true, note. That’s not a strong indication in either direction.” [Pam Moon] had to bring an English equivalent of a FOIA demand (Freedom of Information Act) to get the photographs from Oxford. Fact is that US and British taxpayers footed a good chunk of the bill for the carbon dating.” The British taxpayer also funded the retrieval of the old records.

Interweaving, certainly, and possibly the twisting together of threads, but not splicing of the kind I described above.

The two pieces were not spliced but simply glued together, and could not have had any structural integrity. Furthermore, the two pieces were both found to have been made of cotton, not linen.Now for all I know, as I said before, you may be correct, but so far there is insufficient evidence to assume that.

He also mentions that contaminants may have been washed in with the water used to put out a fire, without imagining the possibility that they may have been washed out again by the water used to clean the sample.Secondly, he ponders the possibilities of superheated steam at temperatures of 900°C. “Any contaminants on, or embedded in, the fabric structure would be dissolved by this steam and forced into the weave and yarn construction, and would react chemically with the molecular structure of the fibres of the flax.” This is pure guesswork. My guess is that any flax in contact with steam at 900°C would immediately be reduced to ashes. The difference between my guess and Tyrer’s? Well, I’ve put linen into an oven at 350°C, and seen it char to ashes in a very short time. I have no doubt that at 900°C there would be nothing left. What experiments has Tyler carried out?But above all, even if all this steam pressure had contaminated the Shroud – there still wouldn’t be three-quarters modern and one quarter old.Over the last few days both OK (authenticist) and I (non-authenticist) have come to an agreement regarding the massive amount of contamination required to make a 1st century date appear 14th century. Anybody who thinks any form of contamination such as black or yellow threads of cotton, insect remains or superheated steam pressure has to explain this quantitively rather than qualitatively, or airy dismissals such as John’s above are nothing but head-in-the-sand ostrich-posing.Authenticists who claim that the basic linen of the radiocarbon samples is different from that of the rest of the Shroud have at least got the proportion problem solved. However they still have to demonstrate how such massive interpolation is so wholly invisible, which, especially since we seem to have discredited the Quad Mosaics and the Morgan’s alleged UV-F manipulation as irrelevant surface contamination only, has become considerably more difficult.","date":"March 25, 2015 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The main problem with Wilson’s assessment is its qualitative insecurity. He mentions all he usual suspects, from wax to cigarette ash, without seriously wondering if it could amount to enough contamination to have any serious effect on the radiocarbon date.Wilson says, of the radiocarbon scientists: “Where, in all the hype put out by the AMS scientists in 1988 about ‘astronomical’ odds was there even the slightest word of caution that contamination might have affected the dating result?” and “But surely the radiocarbon dating laboratories would have made some preliminary check of their samples to make sure that no contamination of any kind was present? The straight answer is no.” Is this fair. This is what the Nature paper says: “Because it was not known to what degree dirt, smoke or other contaminants might affect the linen samples, all three laboratories subdivided the samples, and subjected the pieces to several different mechanical and chemical cleaning procedures.All laboratories examined the textile samples microscopically to identify and remove any foreign material.” And this before the paper goes on to list the various procedures carried out.He also, remarkably, dismisses the interweaving theory, which I think is the only route now open to authenticists. However he does put some credence in the bioplastic coating hypothesis, saying that some sample pieces which had been reserved by Riggi could be seen to be contaminated by a microbiological coating in 1994, and that Prof. Mattingly had sent Harry Gove some samples of such contamination to show that even a 60% contamination was invisible. I find all this rather difficult to accept at face value. If the bioplastic coating was evident to the scientists in 1994, then why should it not have been spotted by the radiocarbon labs in 1988, and how could Mattingly could make it invisible when he sent a sample to Gove?A fibre evenly coated with something twice its mass becomes twice as thick.

As Guerreschi has shown, the outer two arrows point to waterstains that are not associated with the fire at all. The middle arrow shows how very little water actually penetrated the shroud as a result of the fire. Either way, even the big stain almost completely misses the C14 cut-off corner. The other cut-off corner does largely coincide with a larger and more diffuse stain (still not associated with the 1532 fire though), but then so do four other areas along that edge of the shroud, none of which show substantial mould or bacterial damage.2) Garza-Valdez’s bacteria. Those who examined the shroud in 1978 think this is vastly overplayed. To me, it is true, those little purple wiggles look like bacteria, but others claim they are no more than microfibres stripped off the fibres themselves. It is clear that even if they exist these bacteria have had little or no effect on the integrity of the cloth, and do not need (and did not need) to be cut away.3) Terpene and cotton contamination. Pam has confused two separate pieces of research here, which cannot be eaily reconciled. The photo of an alleged piece of intertwined threads of cotton on end and flax the other – and not stuck together with anything – is a different thread from the one examined by Villarreal, where the two pieces were butt-joined, not intertwined, both cotton, and stuck together with gum. Given this contradiction, it is obvious that neither of these observations can be considered representative of the radiocarbon area as a whole.4) The weave pattern. The first photo is the somewhat indistinct one used by Benford and Marino to show that one side of a herringbone ‘spine’ is more irregular than the other, which some textile ‘experts’ agreed may be evidence that the two were not of consistent manufacture. Actually an enlargement of any randomly selected part of the shroud on Shroud 2.0 shows similar irregularities. The second set of pictures does not show the C14 dating sample, or in fact any sample of the shroud at all. Caspar von Uffhofen, from whose work is was taken, says it is an ilustration put together entirely for illustrative purposes by Mssrs Castaldi and Bara.I do not consider that the mouldy corner cut-away hypothesis has been established at all.However, I don’t think the wiping of the cloth with a slightly sticky cotton cloth is unlikely. I suggested it a while ago when I first noticed that the Holland backing cloth under the shroud was considerably lighter than the exposed areas, and thought some stain might have been applied on the more visible areas to try to make them less conspicuous. Such a stain would have almost no effect on the radiocarbon date, but could perhaps account for the chronological gradient observed by Riani and Atkinson.","date":"April 23, 2014 at 10:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/23/new-paper-the-missing-corners-and-the-radiocarbon-date/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Paper: The Missing Corners and the Radiocarbon Date"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I don’t think any UV photography was done on the C14 samples specifically, and they are now mostly not in existence.

The aforementioned observations give a far-reaching possibility of dating profiles investigated in the past, from which macrofossils have already been identified and collected (and thus preserved in glycerine-thymol-ethyl alcohol mixture).” They clearly do not think that even ancient (3000 BC) material is likely to be ruined from a radiocarbon dating point of view by preserving it in thymol, so 2000 year old material would be even less so.","date":"November 8, 2013 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/05/overheard-behind-us-during-barries-talk-thats-only-listerine/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Overheard behind us during Barrie’s Talk: “That’s only Listerine”"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"It’s an interesting artifact and may well be connected to the Templars, the Mandylion and the crusades.

We begin with 32 unique or unusual features. Unique compared to what, I ask myself? In what way is a lack of foreign materials or particulates unique? Or a non-diffuse image with sharp boundaries? Or a reduction of the cloth’s fluorescence? We are not told. Some of the 32 are generally thought of as descriptions of the image on the shroud, some are highly contentious, and some are literally meaningless (e.g. the shroud lacks two dimensional directionality). We are then told that all these features can only be explained by some form of collimated radiation.From this inauspicious beginning we are taken through an increasingly speculative discussion which, as it depends entirely on the shroud falling through a suddenly dematerialised body, is literally untestable. In spite of being told 48 times what “would” have happened, no evidence at all can be adduced to suggest that any of it actually did happen.Again, much of the discussion makes no scientific sense. It is supposed that the body disintegrates in a burst of radiation, and the cloth then falls vertically through it. Before it starts to drop, the initial radiation affects the cloth in direct proportion to the distance of the cloth from the body. This relies on two assumptions that are not considered – firstly that the same amount of radiation is emitted from all parts of the body, and secondly that it travels vertically from the body. No justification for this is offered at all. Be that as it may, what happens next? We are told that the shroud begins to fall vertically through the body cavity. We are not told what the surrounding air would do. Does it rush into the cavity created by the suddenly disintegrated body, swooshing the cloth with it? If not, why not? Well never mind, let’s suppose the shroud falls uniformly downwards. After a very short time those parts that were in direct contact with the body are now within the body cavity, while those parts that were not are still falling through the air separating them from it. At that point, what is the difference between the radiation affecting the area still in the air, and the radiation affecting the part within the cavity? Does it make any sense to speculate? Well never mind, let’s keep going. Radiation consists of particles or energy going from somewhere to somewhere else. It does not consist of a vacuum “containing a small amount of some basic particles of matter such as protons, neutrons and perhaps electrons and gamma rays.” We must surely suppose that all these particles are moving fantastically fast. In which direction are they going? Surely they are shooting outwards from where they come from in all directions. In which case they will destroy the collimation we were hoping to achieve by the shroud dropping vertically through them.And so it goes.

However, one piece of research seems to have closed the issue of its authenticity conclusively. In 1988 the results of radiocarbon dating of fibres from the Shroud were announced, seemingly pinning the origin of the cloth to between 1260 and 1390. Place this information alongside other pieces of evidence, such as a memorandum to the Pope from Bishop d’Arcis of Troyes c. 1389 in which he claimed to be aware of the artist who had faked the Shroud and that it was ‘cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed’, and the argument for the Shroud being a fake is quite convincingly made. …One might have thought that straightforward physical analysis of the cloth would be sufficient to distinguish between a painting and an image produced in some manner by physical contact with a body. Unfortunately, almost every single point made by a scientist, with an established reputation in a relevant field, concerning the image on the Shroud has been contested by an equally reputable scientist with a different point of view. The fact that scientists disagree, and often disagree vehemently, should be a matter brought to the attention of students of all ages. …There have been many attempts to simulate the image on the Turin Shroud, including a painting being impressed onto a cloth in a manner similar to a brass rubbing. A judgment of success can only be subjective, but to date no reproduction has been able to produce the 3D nature of the image with the level of detail in negative!

There is a lot of good scientific and historical evidence for authenticity, but if it comes in a package with this nonsense it is hardly surprising that Jerry Coyne, Joe Nickell and other critics regard the whole case for authenticity with contempt. With friends like these, as I said yesterday, who needs enemies?As usual Stephen’s basic axiom is that the shroud is genuine. Given that premise as indisputable, it would indeed be surprising that a randomly incorrect radiocarbon age would match the date when the shroud is first mentioned historically. However, in logic, the more improbable a corollary, the less sound is the axiom upon which it depends, and Stephen’s own incredulity actually forces a reconsideration of his basic premise as much as it does an expanation of the corollary.Be that as it may, he quotes the unlikeliness of the radiocarbon date matching the historical date as “one in a thousand trillion.” This comes from Harry Gove’s book where it is thrown in at the end of the book with no explanation. It’s nonsense of course. If there is no C-14 in a sample at all, it cannot be dated as older than about a hundred thousand years, and if it contains more C-14 than there is in the atmosphere, it cannot be dated, obviously, to a time in the future. Consequently even if a wholly random date was derived from radiocarbon dating, it would have a one in a hundred thousand chance of being correct. This is ten billion times more likely than Gove’s probability! If a range of a hundred years were acceptable, then the probability that a wholly random C-14 date was co-incidentally correct becomes one in a thousand.Still, one in a thousand is pretty unlikely, which is why the 1350 date cannot be dismissed as random, nor, because it conflicts with Stephen’s axiom, can it be dismissed “out of hand.” If it is wrong, it is wrong for a reason.

Unless deliberate fraud was involved, such as a Vatican plot deliberately to discredit the Shroud or some such, which I do not entertain, the science begins at the laboratories. It is generally not disputed that the protocols carried out there were rigorous, although there were minor, albeit documented, variations in order to prevent too much loss of material during the cleaning process. I do not dispute that some evidence implying contamination has been found, and that it casts doubt on the radiocarbon date, but it is insufficiently consistent to refute it absolutely. Specifically, I do not agree that any form of “invisible” interweaving would actually be undetectable on the radiocarbon sample still held by Tucson and recently photographed by Barrie Schwortz; I do not find the inconsistency between the different proportions of cotton found by various examiners conclusive, and I do not believe that Rogers’s water soluble gum/starch coating would not have been washed off during the cleaning process. I have already demonstrated that the purported irregularities in the reflectivity of the shroud which occur in various photographs owe far more to the way the shroud was lit than to anything intrinsic. Daveb is perfectly correct in my insistence on scientific rigour, and I doubt if anyone has examined these objections to the radiocarbon dating more rigorously than myself.

The short answer is that nobody has yet shown that such a mechanism exists. The Oxford laboratory tried with CO and failed, and charcoal particles created under all sorts of conditions are frequently dated successfully. Given that the Shroud was supposedly stored in a silver casket, the principal, if not the only source of carbon atoms was, of course, the Shroud itself, which would not skew its date. Similarly, unless the shroud was covered in photosynthetic bacteria, and therefore green, the carbon content of any bioplastic coating would be made from the Shroud’s own carbon, and therefore date to the same time. Hypotheses using neutron flux currently belong to “miracle science” which is not amenable to rational investigation.  2) Was the sample area representative of the original whole cloth? This, of course, has been examined exhaustively without achieving consensus. The overriding consideration for me has been the sheer quantity of contamination required to achieve a date adjustment of over a thousand years. The different proportions worked out by scientists relate to the type of contamination, ie what mass of C14 atoms should be added, or what mass of carbon, or what mass of organic material such as thread. Unless black bits of carbon can be identified on the shroud, the contamination is normally supposed to be interpolated thread, in which case two thirds of the sample would consist of contamination, and one third original. I do not accept that any of the evidence put forward to support this argument is sufficiently strong to refute the 13th century date.3)  Radiocarbon dating is often just wrong. I consider this a very weak argument. Had the Shroud dated to the 1st century and anybody dared to put it forward, they would have been considered to be grasping at the feeblest of straws to discredit the date. The same applies here. Radiocarbon dating is never “just wrong.” It is wrong for a number of possible reasons, such as contamination from groundwater, or a marine or terrestrial, rather than an atmospheric, source of the carbon under examination. These reasons can be investigated, but often aren’t, usually because the C14 tests are expensive and the results were only confirmatory anyway. Where they are repeated, the reason for the anomaly is easily found. In the case of the Shroud the Tucson labs have sufficient material to redo the tests.Finally, however, I agree with Marinelli’s conclusion. The Shroud cannot be definitively dated to the middle of the fourteenth century (actually I consider the end of the thirteenth more likely), and there is certainly evidence to the contrary. I do not consider it strong enough to refute the labs’ conclusions; others do. That’s OK. Just as I do not consider them a bunch of bigoted religio-fanatics blinded by stardust and mumbo-jumbo, I hope I will not collect my usual attribution as a sad, desperate moron out only to destroy Christianity and promote the triumph of Beelzebub.","date":"August 4, 2014 at 12:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/04/photo-rich-wonderful-presentation-by-emanuela-marinelli/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Photo Rich, Wonderful Presentation by Emanuela Marinelli"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with believing that the Shroud image may have formed wholly or partly supernaturally.

Although they have a personal interest in the Shroud, both Carpinteri and Fanti have research interests well beyond that specific, which may or may not be worth funding. Carpinteri wants to research piezonuclear emission, whose very existence is hotly disputed, while Fanti has been working on an alternative to radiocarbon dating, by the mechanical testing of very small fibres. This may turn out to be worthwhile for some archaeological artifacts, although almost certainly the Shroud will not be one of them.One wonders what Anonymous would say about the funding of a chemist instead of a physicist trying to investigate an alternative to radiocarbon dating, say by quantifying vanillin loss in aging textiles.

It is mostly about the proportion of cotton which may have been included within the threads of the shroud, and I’m afraid is riddled with inconsistencies.I agree that the difference between cotton and linen fibres cannot be detected by the naked eye, and has to be determined microscopically. This could have been done by those who examined the sticky tape samples of Frei or the STURP team, by Gilbert Raes (and those who used his sample), and the C14 dating teams (or anyone who had access to their sample). It seems that everybody who has done this has identified cotton fibres among the flax. The question is – how much is there?Giulio Fanti (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/fantir7appendix.pdf) reckons that a fibre taken from the C14 sample area contained about 2% cotton.Thibault Heimberger (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part3.pdf) reckons that a fibre taken from the Raes sample is about 15% cotton.Roberto Villarreal (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf) says that of his Raes thread “cotton was a major constituent.”Elsewhere Robert Villarrealo (http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm) says both ends of a ‘spliced’ thread were “definitely cotton and not linen (flax).”Now this simply won’t do.

In practice, materials are always dried thoroughly specifically to exclude any variable water content before weighing.I’m not surprised that a (more-or-less) hydrocarbon such as wax contains a great deal more carbon than a carbohydrate such as cellulose, but as you have calculated, there would still have to be a substantial amount of it to skew the carbon dating appropriately.The sizes and masses of the samples are relatively easy to assess. from Barrie’s photos and the various diagrams and measurements (inconsistent though they be) you can find on the web.

However, it still is not perfectly clear to me where his diagram came from. Mark Oxley (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf) reproduces two diagrams from Riggi (one crossed out). Both, however, show the masses of the cut out sections, from the end of the cloth, as 52.8, 52.0, 39.6, 14.2 mg. In other words the two smallest pieces are side by side. In every subsequent drawing, such as in the Walsh paper, the two smallest pieces are separated from each other by the other two carbon dating pieces.This is significant.Donahue (in his letter to de Cointet – https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/donahue.jpg) says that the Arizona pieces were cut into four subsamples of 13.86, 12.39, 14.27, 11.63 mg (though the last two figures have been amended by de Cointet). If Arizona received the two smallest pieces of the four, these masses must include the 14.2mg sliver. If Jull retained the 12.39mg piece, then Arizona could only have tested three pieces. This is in contradiction of the Nature report, which shows results for four pieces. Walsh does not appear to notice this.De Cointet’s amendment to Donahue’s diagram – which he justifies by claiming Donahue wrote to him again – makes the total of the four pieces add up to 52.8mg. By luck or design, this is the same weight as the piece of carbon dating material furthest away from the sliver, according to Riggi’s diagram. I think de Cointet is trying to suggest that Arizona got one piece from either end of the four sample strip, the 52.8mg piece and the 14.2mg piece, and I think he is doing it to reconcile the fact that Arizona claim to have had five subsamples, four for testing and one for Jull.But he forgets that this means that either Oxford or Zurich must have ended up with the 39.6g piece, which is incorrect.The whole thing is riddled with inconsistencies.","date":"May 1, 2013 at 5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/30/special-request-from-hugh-farey/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Special Request from Hugh Farey"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"To the best of my knowledge the only objection to the image being a scorch/burn is that burns fluoresce under UV light but the Shroud image doesn’t. I have done many experiments myself to confirm this. When linen is heated at a range of different temperatures it invariably produces bright fluorescence even before any mark is clearly visible by ordinary light. At increasing temperatures the linen turns yellow, but without inhibiting the fluorescence, and then brown, when it stops, although the burns still have a bright fluorescent border. My earlier experiments were based on over-contrasty photos of the Shroud: I heated my linen till it went brown, and sure enough the brown areas did not fluoresce, and I thought the image could therefore be a scorch. When I realised that the image was actually yellow, and therefore equivalent to a lower temperature, fluorescence producing heat, I realised that some other mechanism than simple scorching must be involved, hence my further concentration on chemical rather than thermal degradation of the surface of the linen.There are, however, reasonable objections to claiming that modern experiments disprove the burn hypothesis. For a start, the whole shroud fluoresces quite brightly, even in places where there is neither scorch nor image, and it could be that whatever produced the image inhibited, rather than enhanced this background fluorescence, producing the UV image we see today.

Among my pursuits is that of amateur actor..I suppose by my own values I ought simply to chuckle tolerantly and move on, but, as Thomas More points out in ‘A Man For All Seasons,’ “Qui tacet consentire” so I fear it behoves me to reply to Stephen’s comments.From the top:1) Actually, from revisiting the radiocarbon dates, I am increasingly inclined towards a late 13th century date for the Shroud. It’s to do with the kink in the calibration curve that occurs between about 1325 and 1375, and will be further explored in the next Newsletter.2) By “accidentally,” an adverb which has already caused much hilarity in authenticist circles, I do not mean that the image appeared as fortuitously as it has on pieces of toast, pizzas and so on. I think that the image we see now is the inadvertent result of some other intention, not a deliberate attempt to produce the very vague, superficial, scorch-like appearance it has now. Perhaps along the lines of an epitaphios, altar cloth, reredos, or simple object of devotion rather than a deliberate fraud, and the original principle medium has disappeared, leaving what we have now. As to what this medium might have been, I agree that the non-authenticists are no nearer confirming that than the authenticists are with their radiation or vapour hypotheses.3) Is it petty of me not to like Stephen’s term ‘anti-authenticist’? It implies an antagonism towards ‘authenticists’ which I simply don’t feel. Although there are extremists on both sides of the debate, I feel that most of the commenters here are respectful of all the evidence for and against, and their convictions one way or the other do not prevent them from admitting that there are objections to them which have not been decisively refuted.4) I did not know that Stephen had helped put all the early BSTS Newsletters online as well as the ongoing Shroud Spectrum project. Regardless of his views, this is a tedious and time consuming job which has produced the most enormous benefit to Shroud researchers and will continue to do so as long as the internet exists. I have no hesitation whatever in thanking him sincerely for his achievement.5) Stephen denies that he thinks the Shroud is “incontrovertibly authentic” (my words), although he has also claimed that the evidence in favour of it is so “overwhelming” that anyone, including the Catholic Church, who does not accept it is under Satanic influence.“If the Shroud is a deliberate fraud, then it would almost certainly be a work of Satan, and no Church that calls itself Christian should be promoting a deliberate fraud (much less a work of Satan)!” (October 2013, quoted without permission). I stand by my statement.6) I say Stephen discourages comments. He says he only discourages comments which are off-topic, offensive, sub-standard, interminable, time-wasting, getting nowhere or debating. I stand by my statement.7) Stephen re-iterates his misunderstanding of Harry Gove’s statistical statement about astronomical odds, and again misapplies his misinterpretation to the inverse of its meaning. I have discussed this in detail elsewhere.The rest of his post is a re-iteration of his hacking ideas which need not concern us until he produces rather more than the loosest of circumstantial evidence.","date":"August 13, 2014 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi anoxie.

It was the opinion of the radiocarbon team that it would be so improbable for extra neutron radiation to have given a 1st century cloth exactly the date proposed by the forgery hypothesis by chance that the idea could be effectively discounted, and it was much more likely that the Shroud was, in fact, datable to the time they dertermined. Jones, blithely assuming an incontrovertible 1st century date, uses this statement to mean that, since the probability of producing a 13th century date by chance was discountable, it must have been produced deliberately. He has ignored the fact that the radiocarbon scientists were referring specifically to random neutron radiation as the cause of the discrepancy, and implies that no process at all could result in a 13th century date by chance. In saying this he ignores the work of Benford, Marino, Rogers, Villarreal and Brown, all of whom have demonstrated that interpolated weaving could have produced a 13th century date entirely fortuitously.De Wesselow is quoted as making a similar argument: “If the carbon-dating error was accidental, then it is a remarkable coincidence that the result tallies so well with the date always claimed by sceptics as the Shroud’s historical debut.” But this is only one half of an opinion. The other half says: “If the carbon-dating was accurate, then it is no coincidence at all that it tallies perfectly with the first known accounts of the Shroud’s appearance.”Jones finds a 1st century provenance for the Shroud “overwhelming.” I, on the other hand, do not. However, even if it were, in fact even if it were proved, that would not of itself be evidence of fraudulent radiocarbon dating.I have no doubt that Jones will quote Harry Gove and Emanuela Marinelli at length, as they detail any amount of clumsiness, miscommunication and irregularity over the taking of the radiocarbon sample, none of which I dispute.

You are correct that no mathematical answer can be found to vaguely generalised premises, but words like astronomical and miraculous imply that even with the little data we have, some estimate of the probability can be made, and that it would be staggeringly unlikely. Neither you nor I like that kind of “plucking from the air,” so I set myself a very specific question, with clearly calculable answers.1) The shroud was made in 25AD. Shortly before the crucifixion. I could have meandered around between 10AD and 33AD, but lets stick to 25AD. A material made in 25AD contains 78.70% of its original C14.2) The contamination was made in 1535. I could have picked a later date, but I chose just after the fire. If there was some reweaving, it must have been at some time, and the exact date is, as it happens, irrelevant. Material from 1535 contains 96.44% of its original C14.3) The ‘target’ date. Between 1260 and 1390. As given in the Nature paper. A material from 1260 contains 91.0% of its C14, and a material from 1390 contains 92.77%.4) Pick a random percentage between 0 and 100. If there was between 0 and 70% of contamination, the resultant date would be too old to amaze Stephen with its uncanny accuracy. If there was between 80 and 100% the resultant date would be too young. That leaves a range of between 70% and 80% which would produce the ‘astronomically unlikely figure’ given by the Nature paper. That’s about 10% of the possible random selections, or 1 in 10. This answer is not plucked from the air or thrown to the wind.The heterogeneity of the sample is irrelevant in this context, as the date of any sample is from the whole sample, whether the new and old threads were neatly separated or intricately blended makes no difference. Neither we, nor Jones, are talking about the whole shroud here. He cannot accept that the Nature dates are achievable by chance, which is the whole basis of his conspiracy theory. Actually they are.Incidentally, as long as the contamination was between about 1500 and 1900, it doesn’t even matter if we don’t know what date it was from. If I rephrased my question as follows: “What is the probability that a random percentage of cloth, from a random year between 1500 and 1900, added to a cloth made in 25AD, could result in a radiocarbon date of between 1260 and 1390?” the answer is still about 1 in 10.I simply can do the math, and so can anybody else. Dan is perfectly correct that to that extent, Sue and Joe’s contamination hypothesis is more probable than it may previously have appeared – although there does have to be an awful lot of it.","date":"May 29, 2014 at 1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/29/the-challenge-for-stephen-now/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Challenge for Stephen Now"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“The Midwest Center for Mass Spectrometry (MCMS) at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, made dozens of scans on different samples in 1981.

Two possible scenarios seem equally valid here, although I don’t in fact think either of them true. One is that the thin sliver of C14 sample retained by Douglas Donahue (Tucson) has been dated, and, coming out 1st century, the news was quietly suppressed by the nasty atheistic scientists, and the other is that the Church has carried out its own dating, and coming out 13th century, has quietly suppressed the results so as not to bring about the end of Christianity. My skepticism of authenticity is not rooted on that premise. It is based on the irrefutability, so far, of the C14 results we have, and the inability of the authenticists to decide how the man and the cloth were posed in the tomb in order to produce the image. There is some evidence against the C14 date, but not enough for me, and some evidence concerning possible 1st century image-making, but again, just not enough for me. I have no grudge whatever against those who feel the opposite, although I draw the line at people who shout FACT when they mean opinion, and people who, having been overwhelmed by the evidence on one side or the other, are no longer able to see that there are valid contradictory viewpoints.","date":"June 2, 2014 at 1:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/30/the-collapse-of-the-fraud-theory/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Collapse of the Fraud Theory"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi Helmut.There are several things a little awry with your comment above, which need to be untangled. Firstly, you’re correct that a flat denial is a dogma rather than a conclusion, but the evidence you were asking for has been explored in considerable detail on this sight, so Dan’s denial should be seen in that light. The fact that “there seems no convincing explanation” for the 13th century date cuts little ice with the people who think that the Shroud does, in fact, date from the 13th century, and even those who think it genuine have come up with a number of more convincing ideas than a Soviet plot.You ask: Why have all free existing pieces of the shroud been confiscated shortly after the results have been proclaimed and any new carbon-dating strictly forbidden? Well there are certainly two pieces of the C14 sample which are still in the possession of the Tucson Lab, and any number of threads and fibres owned by the Whangers, and several others with access to Riggi and Gonella’s various hooverings. They have not been confiscated and as far as I know, nobody has been forbidden to carry out a test on those pieces. The most obvious reason for not wanting a further test on the actual Shroud is that the Church thinks the results will not, however carefully carried out, decide the matter one way or another, and so would simply be a waste of a precious relic, but why might the Church not want a reliable testing of the remaining Tucson pieces (which were, it must be remembered, retained specifically for just such a purpose).What are the alternatives?a) The Church knows the Shroud is medieval and does not want it confirmed?b) The Church knows the Shroud is ancient and does not want it confirmed?c) The Church thinks the Shroud is medieval and does not want its antiquity proved?d) The Church thinks the Shroud is ancient and does not want its modernity proved?Only (a) and (d) make sense, suggesting the Church either knows or at least thinks that the Shroud is medieval, and does not want that fact convincingly confirmed.","date":"June 1, 2014 at 2:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/30/the-collapse-of-the-fraud-theory/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Collapse of the Fraud Theory"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Nevertheless, it is good that we examine all the theories put forward, however outré they first appear, on their merits.

If you believe that the different colours on the quad photos represent different materials, then you must believe that the wide blue bands across three of the photos represent a different material from the orangy-yellow field, and that the dark green corners on all four photos represent another, and that the deep pinky-red area of the dorsal legs represents yet another. This is absurd. The similarity between the colour distortions on all four photos suggests that they are due to the similar way each photo was lit, and nothing to do with the composition of the cloth.John, I read the quotation entirely accurately the first time, thank you, and believe that the ‘darning’ referred to by Delorenzi was that of the repairs to the burn holes, and not to anywhere else. It is apparent from the clumsiness of the patching, and the fact that extra patches of a different material were added to the original ones, and the black stitching that used to be easy to see which was always used by Sebastian Valfré, that several hands, at several different times, contributed to these repairs. As I explained above, anybody today can examine the Shroud more closely than Delorenzi could, simply by looking at Shroud 2.0, and I challenge anybody to find any evidence of any mending anywhere other than in the areas of the burn holes, where the stitch holes from the patches are still evident.In what sense is my argument uninformed?

(http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerppt.pdf)2) Because he said so.3) No.4) From examination of photographs.5) No.(Five questions…)A bit of elaboration though. I am not in favour of accusing anybody of fraud without very good reason to do so, and the fact that I disagree with their findings is not a good reason. People do make mistakes, and it is possible that the threads Rogers received from Gonella were misattributed, but again, simply disagreeing with conclusions is not not evidence for such misattribution. If McCrone shows me a slide covered in red dots he calls iron oxide, or Max Frei shows me a slide of a pollen grain he calls Prunus arabica, then I assume that the dots do look like iron oxide, and the grain looks like Prunus arabica, unless somebody can show me that they don’t. I may think that the dots are actually something else similar, or that the pollen grain looks like dozens of similar species, but I do not doubt that the scientists made their identifications in good faith. Naive of me, perhaps, but once you start accusing people of fraud, where can you stop, and why should you have any credibility yourself?The answers to the first two questions, then, are not, to mind, evidence that Rogers did not, in fact, examine fibres from the Shroud.The second two, however, raise corollaries. The photo of a fragment of the radiocarbon sample sent to Thomas Ferguson, David Pearson, Louis Harner and  was not very clear. I do not know what else Benford and Marino asked these experts, or what other information they were given.Thomas Ferguson was non-committal – the right hand side may have been ” “touched up to prevent unraveling”.David Pearson was more positive: “there is no question that there is different material on each side… It is definitely a patch.” This, of course, was in the days when Benford and Marino assumed that each radiocarbon piece was dated as a whole, and that the date of the piece reflected the proportions of the two materials. Actually, this piece was cut into five, and if Pearson was correct, some dates would have been all 1st century, some dates would have been 16th or 17th century, and only where the materials merged would the 14th century, mixed, date have been found. That this did not happen is evidence that Pearson was quite simply completely wrong. He also said that “medieval European weavers would … hand-stitch approximately ½ inch of new material into the old, such that it was invisible to all but the trained eye.” This half inch of blended threads is not visible at all to any eye, which suggests that it isn’t there.Louis Harmer said “the float is different on either side of the sample.” It is not clear to me if he was making the same mistake as Pearson.It is interesting that a second set of photos – from the Oxford sample this time – has been sent to Thomas Ferguson, and reported on in detail by Donna Campbell. Her comments are considerably more circumspect. “There are signs in the Shroud sample that direct the notion of mending or reweaving of the actual woven fabric.” Directing a notion is hardly a ringing endorsement. (http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Home_files/Updated_report_on_the_Consideration_to_the_Uniformity_and_Effects_of_the_Fabric_in_the_Shroud_of_Turin-5-1.pdf)Finally, nobody has refuted Flury-Lemberg’s insistence that “invisible mending” is not invisible. This has become something of an impasse. Devotees insist that there is a style of mending which is completely invisible even under a microscope. The fact that it cannot be seen just shows how invisible it is. They point to French Reweaving, the Frenway Method or Invisible Mending, all of which are commercially available, as evidence that mending can be invisible, but they’re wrong. No actual invisible mender is so foolish as to claim that his mend is actually invisible, even under a microscope. Indeed, as  Flury-Lemberg humourously pointed out, how could you see what you were doing if your work disappeared in front of your eyes! The last resort of the invisible mending faction is to claim that it was carried out in a style since lost to us. So not only is the invisible mending itself invisible, but so is the invisible mending technique!","date":"November 22, 2015 at 9:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I find it strange that so many people focus on the colour anomaly which occurs in the bottom left hand corner of all four photos, but completely ignore – and I do mean ignore; to my knowledge no one has commented on it in spite of my continuously pointing it out – the much larger colour differences which cross the entire photos.

Of course there are objections to this hypothesis, which many people, including myself, give some weight to, but at the moment I do not find them sufficiently cogent to persuade me of the Shroud’s authenticity. Thibault Heimburger’s paper, https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibault-lg.pdf, examines what Garlaschelli actually produced and makes good observations about their failings even while admitting that they are the best artificial versions so far. I think there is certainly more to be done, but if Garlaschelli could be bothered to take Thibault’s objections to heart and make appropriate modifications, I think a more acceptable fac simile is far from improbable.I do not reject an ‘unscientific miracle’ out of hand – just there’s nothing to be investigated if that’s how it was done – but I do not find any of the ‘scientific miracles’ at all convincing, be they of mysterious emanations of cadaverine, ammonia, neutrons, electrons, electromagnetic radiation or whatever.

I agree with this: “It certainly seems curious that if the Shroud is a sample of the Quem Quaeritis cloths, that it should be the only one to survive.” I believe this to be a major objection to the Quem Quaeritis hypothesis, and there are several others, many of which I have clearly set out on this site. There are objections to the stability of the C14 dating, and there is some evidence in favour of both a 1st century date and a Middle Eastern provenance, which I have also acknowledged in detail.On balance, as I have said and explained why, before, I believe that the Shroud is medieval, and for this conclusion I have been personally abused by most of the authenticists who comment on this site. I, on the other hand, quite understand why they have come to a contrary opinion, and sincerely wish them well in their efforts to substantiate their view.

To take a couple:1) (from daveb above) “Effect of 1532 fire on paint products: Hematite expected, heating tests had shown that hematite was reduced to magnetite, no such effect observed on Shroud.” Rogers’s experiments, and the accompanying photos, show a piece of linen sandwiched between two steel plates and heated at the centre. I would like to know whereabouts, on the cloth, the hematite was reduced to magnetite, and whether there were concomittant effects on the cloth at the same point. Presumably there was some gradient. Rogers says that, “all paints were changed by heat and/or the chemically reducing and reactive pyrolysis products (formaldehyde, furfural, organic acids, CO, etc.). Some Medieval painting materials become water soluble and they would have moved with the water that diffused through parts of the cloth at the time of the AD 1532 fire. Observations of the Shroud in 1978 showed that nothing in the image moved with the water.” But he does not say what temperatures are needed to achieve these effects, and whether those temperatures also cause any discolouration of linen fibres. The temperature gradient is very important. Either there was one, in which case we would expect different effects on different parts of he Shroud, or there wasn’t, in which case we would observe uniform effects.2) (from Rogers’ paper) Compare Figures 3 and 18. They are both claimed to be UV images but are completely different. Figure 18 shows that the Holland cloth fluoresces (if it is fluorescence) intensely at the place from which the Raes sample was taken, but not elsewhere, but Rogers does not account for this. Being covered with the Shroud would have had minimal effect on the oxygenation or temperature of that area compared to the rest.3) (from Rogers’ paper)  “Diane Soran (deceased) of Los Alamos, tested hemolysis on Saponaria-washed cloth before we went to Turin. The blood is still red on those 25-year-old samples. Controls are black.” I have grown Saponaria, produced soap from it and soaked cloths in it. It has had no effect on the preservation of blood colour. It is a pity that in a heavily illustrated paper Diane Soran’s experiments could not be shown.I mention these not to prove that Rogers was a poor scientist, agenda driven (neither of which I believe) or even wrong, but merely to show that even the most careful of papers can have inconsistencies and anomalies which it is not rude or arrogant to want cleared up before being accepted as gospel.","date":"March 17, 2015 at 3:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"But Thomas is perfectly correct.

As such, it does not demonstrate where McCrone went wrong, which would have been helpful, and demonstrates an unscientific partiality.For instance, McCrone examined 10 more slides than Heller and Adler, and found red ochre adhering to fibres on 18 of them, all those which corresponded to image or blood areas, and none on non-image areas. He illustrates his findings on page 105 of ‘Judgment Day for the Turin Shroud.’ This was the foundation of his ‘painting’ hypothesis.Well, did he or didn’t he? Are the photos falsified fabrications? Are all those red particles not iron oxide at all? If they are related to the retting procedure, they would be found on non-image as well as image fibres, and if they are related to the blood, they would be found on blood areas but not image areas.McCrone may have been completely wrong, and he was certainly somewhat abrasive, but simply to ignore his work does not enhance the credibility of authenticist commenters.","date":"October 29, 2015 at 10:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/29/battle-of-the-chemists/","cat":"presentation","title":"Battle of the Chemists"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Many people read more of their own ideas into STuRP’s formal conclusion than is justified. Di Lazzaro says that the conclusion denies the possibility of a scorch, when in fact it does exactly the opposite, if, as Colin suggests we interpret “something which resulted in oxidation, dehydration and conjugation of the polysaccharide structure of the microfibrils of the linen” and “a similar type of change in linen can be obtained by sulfuric acid or heat” as, indeed, forms of scorch.Similarly, the STuRP conclusion’s reference to the 3D quality of the image very carefully omits any mention of any form of transfer of information across a “cloth-body distance” although it comes down quite firmly in favour of a contact transfer. It is a subtle point, but the fact that the image seems to relate to a possible cloth-body distance does not mean that some kind of transfer of information across that distance actually caused it. A charcoal copy of the shroud would also imply some form cloth-body-distance/intensity relationship, but would obviously not be made by it.Finally Nabber finds a quotation which almost exactly parallels Colin’s statement about UV above, but seems to think it means the opposite. Bern Kohler’s mention of ‘photochemical havoc’ refers specifically to the damage caused by UV radiation to human cells; as Colin says “one is right to flag up the dangers of excessive uv exposure where humans and their crops are concerned.” Kohler, like Colin, is well aware that most materials are unaffected by UV radiation.Colin’s criticism of these specific points in di Lazzaro’s interpretation of the STuRP conclusion is entirely justified.

I believe, for example, that there is a consensus among climate scientists that global CO2 levels are increasing. There are many scientists who disagree, but the consensus is… etc. etc.It is in this context that I believe that, if there is any consensus at all, the consensus among those interested in the shroud is that it is not the burial cloth of Jesus. That doesn’t mean it’s true, it’s just what most of them believe, I think.As to people who claimed to be king of the Jews, the ever-useful Wikipedia lists eight others from around the time of Jesus, from Simon of Perea (c. 4BC) to Lukuas (115AD), and they were just the leaders of the main revolts against the Romans. Any of them, or any of their officers might have merited some form of mock-helmet. The identification of the injuries made by a cap of spikes with a royal crown is very much a post hoc propter hoc argument.As far as Ron has read, he says, crucifixions did not normally include a severe flogging beforehand. I would be interested to know of any first or second century sources for that statement, and whether they applied across the Roman empire, or locally to the area from which they come. My own reading suggests that we simply do not know.Similarly, I do not believe there is any evidence that Jewish crucifixion victims were ‘normally’ thrown into common graves, and even if they were, I do not believe the graves were then likely to have been excavated by wild animals. As I have mentioned, the only crucifixion victim whose remains have been identified as such was in a family ossuary. Daveb suggests, sensibly, that there may be no way of identifying crucifixion victims from their bones anyway, except in the case of the poor chap whose execution was bungled.Ron concludes his latest comment by saying that there is no doubt that the shroud is Jesus – “or a depiction of him.” While I agree that if the image is a depiction, it is most likely that it is a depiction of Jesus (not a certainly, as there are a few other candidates, but a strong probability), I think that if it is not a “depiction,” then the probability that it comes from the body of Jesus is considerably less.As to the consensus being “ridiculous” then for all I know Ron might be right; lots of consensuses are. That doesn’t stop them from being consensuses, however.Finally, although I have said that I think estimates of probability are naive, I think that of behalf of the ridiculous consensusees, I’ll try to make one. I’m going to claim (and I challenge anyone to produce archaeological or historical evidence against these), that 25% of all crucifixion victims did not have their legs broken but were stabbed as a confirmation of death, that 5% were mercilessly flogged before being crucified, and that 1% were treated to a spiked helmet or crown. Assuming these three treatments were independent, then 1 in every 8000 crucifixions had injuries similar to those on the shroud. Let us suppose that the Romans crucified Jews for about 400 years, at a rate of 1 a day except during rebellions when the number rose to 500 a day according to Josephus. Let’s go for a total of 160 000. That means that 20 were crucified in the same way as Jesus. Of those, one left a shroud that remains to this day. I wonder which one…(daveb, I’m sure, will counter this argument very reasonably, but I make it just to show that wild claims of billions to one owe more to hopeful faith than to statistics)","date":"January 27, 2013 at 7:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/25/eric-j-jumper-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"event","title":"Eric J.

Suffice it to say that until the statue of Zeus from Olympia was removed to Byzantium in about 420AD, most (all?) pictures of Christ had short frizzy hair and a stubbly beard. When pictures of Christ with long beard and hair appeared, some people deplored the fact that he resembled the statue of Zeus, and Theodoros Anagnostes claims that the first painter to produce one suffered a withered arm in consequence, although the church’s rapid acceptance of the style is demonstrated by the painter’s recovery after the intercession of Archbishop Gennadios. The Image of Edessa appears about a hundred years later, although legend has since given it earlier, spurious, provenance.Back to Ron. Nowhere in the bible does it appear that Jesus’s scourging was ‘excessive.’ Only John even mentions scourging, and Luke implies that Jesus was given more of a token punishment – a chastisement, as some translations have it. Matthew and Mark refer more to a general beating-up than a judicial punishment.A list of Jewish Messiahs can be found by typing in ‘Jewish Messiahs’ in Google, and Josephus’s mentions of crucifixion by typing in ‘Josephus Crucifixion.’ I should be interested if Ron can find a link to a single one of his ‘most archaeologists’ who think mass open graves were a feature of first century Palestine. Either way he seems to disagree with them himself by quoting Josephus, who says that Jews took particular care of their dead and buried them before nightfall.[and how about this for a frivolous coincidence? Look at the left hand of the statue of Zeus preserved in Leningrad, and then at the right hand of almost any pantocrator.

Almost all the scientific papers on shroud.com do not, in fact, come down on one side or the other. Their thrust is more towards whether the shroud image occurred naturally or artificially. Naturally, in this case, usually includes supernaturally. On this subject, I believe the consensus is that the shroud image is natural.These two consensuses are, of course, difficult to reconcile, and therein, I believe, lies the enduring fascination of the shroud. Attempts have been made to use probability to settle the matter one way or another, but they have been somewhat naive.I’m not sure I follow Jean L Gabriel’s question. Our knowledge of particular first century crucifixion victims is vanishingly small. Our knowledge of crucifixion at all is pretty slight. Archaeology has given us two scribbled drawings and a heel bone with a nail in it. In modern forensics, we might make a list of all the characteristics on the shroud and compare them with a list of possible victims, to see which one fitted the evidence best. The trouble with the shroud is that we only know one of the possible victims, and we don’t know if he was typical of hundreds, or unique.

He then considers what his correspondent calls the ‘path-length dependent attenuation of the concentration,’ but without, I feel, much enthusiasm, considering various surface factors to be more important.

I think Nickell’s conclusions are summed up in his article, “Claims of Invalid “Shroud” Radiocarbon Date Cut from Whole Cloth”, on the http://www.csicop.org website, although he has restated them in various other articles since then.Before I address Nickell, there is something a bit worrying about your own post, if I may be so brave. Atheists are directing Christians to Nickell? This casts so many aspersions it is difficult to know where to begin. Atheists are all duplicitous? Christians are all stupid? The Shroud constitutes a watershed between atheism and Christianity? I’m not sure what to make of it myself.Anyway, back to Nickell, whose 2005 article began as a rebuttal of Rogers’s Thermochimica Acta paper.“Ray Rogers, a retired research chemist, now admits there is the equivalent of a watercolor paint on the alleged burial cloth of Jesus.” This is deliberately provocative, of course. Nickell knows perfectly well that Rogers insisted that the material with the dye and water-soluble gum on was not part of the original cloth, and that even if it was, the radiocarbon sample is nowhere near where there would be any ‘watercolor paint’ anyway.This attitude continues throughout the article, and I don’t want to pursue it here. I would advise readers (especially all those gullible Christians who do what atheists tell them) to look up the primary sources (there we go again) and decide for themselves, but not to fall into the trap which Nickell appears to have fallen into himself, that of thinking that simply by discrediting one’s opponent’s evidence for their hypothesis, one somehow provides evidence for one’s own. Much of what NIckell says is not necessarily incorrect.i don’t think it wise to disparage Walter McCrone too much. In some ways he was not unlike Ray Rogers, and their characters were such that it is not surprising that they first became friends, nor that they later fell out. Both were scrupulous scientists widely respected in their fields, both founded ongoing successful scientific journals, and both sporadically drove people mad by their attitudes and practices. Which of them was the more correct in their conclusions regarding the Shroud is still an open question.","date":"September 10, 2015 at 4:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/08/new-youtuibe-presentation-is-the-shroud-of-medieval-forgery/","cat":"presentation","title":"New YouTube Presentation:  Is the Shroud a Medieval Forgery?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Professor Marinelli’s paper is an an excellent review of the evidence, but does not comment or evaluate it very thoroughly. She does have the advantage of Max Frei’s articles in Italian, which seem to have been more comprehensive than his account in Shroud Spectrum International, but I do not think they clarify the case.To review a little of what Frei is quoted as having said:“The tapes are put in contact with a light pressure, and, due to their stickiness, when they are detached, they remove all the microtraces without damaging or altering the support in any way.” —  If Frei changed his tactics between 1973 and 1978, when he applied the tapes with such force the STuRP team were horrified, then there should be a big difference between the amount of debris on them. If a light pressure was all that was needed in 1973, why did he change his modus operandi in 1978?“The advantage of this method, widely used in criminology, is that – once the tape is folded on itself – loss of material or secondary contamination are completely excluded.” — Fine, but he didn’t fold the tapes in on themselves; he stuck them to microscope slides, as in the photos at http://llanoestacado.org/freeinquiry//skeptic/shroud/as/schafersman.html.“In subsequent analyses of dust samples it was possible to find and classify a large number of pollen grains which, properly treated, have allowed the precise determination of the family, genus and species of the plant itself.” — It is not true that pollen is classifiable at species level even today, and was even less so 40 years ago.“Each identification result was checked on herbarium material and in botanical gardens worldwide renowned for their collections, as well as documented in photomicrographic surveys.” — I’m afraid that without proper documentation I simply don’t believe this. In the absence of adequate comparison material Frei went to places he thought were relevant and collected his own. Whether he made a micrographical survey is open to doubt.And so on. Antero’s last comment reads “… Professors Danin and Baruch who confirmed many of Frei’s taxonomical pollen classification at least at genus level.”Really? Prof. Danin has changed his mind about the validity of any of Frei’s findings.. In 1998 he wrote (http://www.shroud.com/danin2.htm):“Dr. Uri Baruch, palynologist with the Israel Antiquities Authority who made his M.SC. and Ph.D. dissertations on the flora of Israel, analyzed most of Frei’s 1973 sticky tape pollen specimens and ten of the twenty-five 1978 sticky tapes. He examined 165 pollen grains, of which 45 (27.3%) were Gundelia tournefortii.”But in 2011, he wrote (http://flora.org.il/en/books/plant-stories-2/chapter-o/useful_plants_06/):“The sample we used in our previous publications is the grain presented on the left side of Fig. 15.2.2. [a single ‘Shroud’ pollen previously identified as Gundelia tournefortii]. At first sight one can say that it has “thorns” similar to those on the right side of Fig. 15.2.2. [a group of modern pollen identified as Gundelia tournefortii]. However, looking more thoroughly, one can see that the “thorns” of the right photograph are more pointed and denser compared to the “thorns” in the left photograph. The right photograph is of grains taken from a Gundelia tournefortii flowers. It is not the same as the grain on the left.”and“Prof. Litt concluded that none of the pollen grains he saw could be named at a species level. Hence, all the conclusions drawn from previous palynological investigations of Dr. Frei’s material should be suspended until a new collection of pollen grains can be carried out and the grains thus obtained can be studied with modern equipment and by an expert of pollen of this area.”and finally“Since writing [Prof. Litt’s] conclusions in 2001 no pollen grains have been collected and investigated as he suggested, so the data concerning pollen grains should not be used in Shroud research.”Matthew L., may I offer a word of advice? In researching your article, although you may want to use Charles’s, my own or Antero’s suggestions as gateways, always go right back to primary sources wherever you can, and make your own decisions based on them, rather than merely quoting the opinions of others. Charles, and ‘his’ author, do not believe the Shroud can be authentic at all. Antero, and ‘his’ author, are confirmed authenticists, and I (of course) am completely unbiased (yes, all right, don’t laugh…).

However, the Shroud is not a hologram, in any of the various senses of the word.It is true that a partial three dimensional form (either material, such as Jackson’s cardboard layers, or virtual, as a digital database in a computer) can be constructed from the image on the shroud, and that holograms can be made from three dimensional forms, but that does not mean that the two dimensional image is a hologram, and more than any other two dimensional image is a hologram.Soons’ holograms are not derived from the image on the Shroud, but from Bernardo Galmarini’s digital three dimensional form of that image. And that requires a great deal more explanation than is given on Soons’ website. It seems to be a truism that the intensity of the image at any one place appears to be inversely related to a distance between a body and a shroud. However the nature of this inverse relationship is far from obvious, and depends on the position of the body, the position of the shroud, and precisely what is meant by the ‘distance between the two’ (vertical, perpendicular to the cloth, perpendicular to the body, the shortest distance between a point on the body and a point on the cloth, or vice versa). Having established that, one must then determine whether the intensity/distance relationship is linear, exponential, quadratic or something else. These factors are not part of the shroud and must be inferred by the ‘sculptor’ based, I’m afraid, on what he thinks the final form should look like, not on any objective data on the image itself.It would be interesting to give a sculptor an ordinary full face photograph of someone, and ask them to produce a three dimensional face from it.

They begin their investigations by assuming that the image is of a dead body, and working from there. There would be no point in doing anything different. However their interpretations of what they observe are sufficiently different for us to recognise a certain subjectivity about their observations, and other interpretations of the size and posture of the body which might have produced the image have also been very different.On calcium, R.A. Morris of the STuRP team identified the calcium by X-Ray Fluorescence. He discussed it in some detail, and was of the opinion that it was surface contamination, because the areal densities of calcium and strontium across the Shroud were very similar to the densities of the same elements found on the Holland cloth. He goes on to say: “Both calcium and strontium are relatively common elements. For instance, we might expect considerable quantities of airborne CaC03 from the rich marble and limestone regions of northern Italy. In igneous rocks strontium occurs as a substitutional element for calcium and potassiumin plagioclase and potash feldspars respectively. These minerals are both quite susceptible to weathering and represent major sources of clay in some areas. Although other explanations are possible, the uniform calcium and strontium distributions might be explained simply as dust accumulations.” However, Morris acknowledge that there might be additional calcium deeper among the fibres, which did not register on his spectra because: “X-ray attenuation by hydrocarbons is greatest at lower energies and in these measurements would strongly suppress the calcium peak. We measured an attenuation of approximately 75% for Ca Ka X-rays through 20 mg cmS2 cellulose. If the calcium were distributed uniformly through the cloth instead of at the surface, the actual weight concentrations could be twice as large as thenumbers quoted.” In other words any calcium which might have accumulated as part of the retting process would be in addition to, not as a substitute for, that observed by Morris.","date":"March 30, 2015 at 5:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/27/ray-schneiders-five-part-eight-hour-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"presentation","title":"Ray Schneider’s Five Part Eight Hour Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Perhaps if you checked the 9 locations against the geological maps at http://www.geology-israel.co.il/WEB%20PAGE/MAPS.HTML then your understanding would be improved.

I did not comment on Fanti’s finding because I do not know enough about them. As I said.He also says that “Hugh apparently doubts that God is not subject to time.” This is untrue. It is precisely because God is not subject to time that it is absurd to insists that this or that miracle “has to be” instantaneous.

Although I deplore any vicious personal attacks and obscene language directed towards anyone, I fear that Louis’ paper is unlikely to rehabilitate Prof. Fanti in the eyes of those who think him discredited. Let’s start with the task of demonstrating the truth of the Resurrection. ” It will have to be demonstrated beyond doubt that the image formation was near-instantaneous, if not instantaneous, a task that can be easily handled by both Professor Giulio Fanti and Professor Paolo di Lazzaro.” A task that can be easily handled? Hmmm. The reason given for near-instantaneousness being that all Jesus’s miracles were instantaneous. Really? What about the feeding of the five thousand? Or walking on water? Hmmm.Then we move on to demonstrating that the Shroud has been reliably dated to the 1st century AD by three different dating methods. These were publicised in his book ‘Il Mistero della Sindone,’ and soundly criticised to such an extent that the paper based on it later submitted for peer review did not mention the Shroud of Turin at all, and excluded the multi-parametric mechanical analysis entirely. The Shroud has certainly not been “reliably dated” to the 1st century AD.Next we find that criticism about the provenance of his Shroud fibres was unjustified because “I made it clear that that the samples were among those taken by STURP in 1978 and considered authentic by the previous papal custodian, Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini, who encouraged me in my Turin Shroud studies,” and in the paragraph below Louis says, “You received the fibres from the same sample in the possession of Shroud scientist Ray Rogers.” In fact of course Fanti’s own book makes it perfectly clear that he was testing “le polveri aspirate nel prelievo ufficiale del 1978 sul lenzuolo torinese dalla zona dell’immagine dei glutei” and (although I could have missed it) I find no mention of Rogers’ fibres at all. STuRP, of course, disassociated themselves from Giovanni Riggi’s vacuum cleaner experiments, and neither considered them nor mentioned them in their subsequent investigations. The samples taken by STuRP were tape extractions directly from the surface of the Shroud. Riggi’s hooverings came from between the Shroud and the backing cloth.Then we move on to the idea that the entire radiocarbon sample, and a larger area around it, was part of a 13th century patch, which consequently dated to the 13th century when radiocarbon tested. Mechtilde Flury-Lemberg did not notice any such patch. “Perhaps Dr. Flury-Lemberg was looking possible discontinuities, some traces of workmanship, caused by the  junction between the main Shroud and a possible patch in an area very close to the location from where the 1988 sample was cut. It appears that she did not go beyond that area.” No, it doesn’t. It appears that there is no evidence for a large patch.Now we wander off track, discussing the Bari conference and digressing briefly into the theory of evolution. “Evolution is frequently referred to as though it is something that can explain why Man is on Earth, especially by some biologists, but that is not true. It involves huge problems and explanations are needed. It is the means used by atheists to “demonstrate” that God is not necessary, but they fail when it comes to many points, which are frequently hidden from the public.” Oh, dear. Here we go again. The implication, of course, being that anybody who believes in evolution is an atheist. Including the previous two popes, I suppose, so it puts me in good company. Once again (see an earlier post) not believing that the Shroud is authentic is prima facie evidence for atheism.Back to the Shroud, and DNA. Especially from 24 identified plants (listed on page 183 of Il Mistero della Sindone). Guess how many of these were identified by Max Frei on his pollen tapes. Just two. And where are Scheuermann’s Chysanthemum, or Avinoam Danin’s “continuous carpet” of Matricaria, or Anthemis, or Gundelia, or Zygophyllum, or Thomas Litt’s Carduus? Is this evidence of anything? What does Prof. Fanti say? “The recent results of dusts vacuumed from the TS confirm the data obtained by Frei Sulzer; the fragments of pollen grains on the relic detected by me match the results published by him.” Well, they don’t, do they.Wandering off again, we visit the Jospice mattress and a handkerchief with paintings of Padre Pio on one side and Jesus on the other that I am not familiar with. “According to Professor Pietro Baraldi of Modena University the image is made of no substance known on earth.” Wooo.Sorry for the length. I was accused yesterday of not being rigorous enough with my investigations into evidence, a claim that will return to haunt the accuser, I fear…","date":"October 12, 2014 at 2:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/12/just-the-facts-maam/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"\"Just the facts, ma’am.\""},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi, Louis! You’re quite right. Although I do I “rarely address any correspondent directly,” there are occasions when I do; sometimes this is in answer to a particular request (such as ‘ Where can I find a copy of this paper or that’ or ‘I want an explanation’ as above) which is probably known to other readers, sometimes to welcome someone who I do not remember having responded to before, and sometimes to make it clear to whose post I am responding, when there have been several commenters over a short space of time. I expect there are exceptions, but that’s my general practice, it seems.As for your theology, Louis, I have indeed read it carefully, and it has tangled itself up into such a muddle that you might do well to re-read it yourself. First you claimed that all Jesus miracles were instantaneous, not qualified by saying “only cures,” except for two blind men, who were kept waiting. When I mentioned the loaves and the fishes, you realised how absurd the sudden production of 5000 lunches appears, and said the ‘nature’ miracles didn’t count, and when I asked why any miracles ‘had to be’ instantaneous, you took refuge in asking whether I thought Jesus liked people to suffer. Did he make them wait? Well, yes, he did. Not only the two blind men you yourself quoted previously, but in the case of Lazarus, to the extreme distress of his relatives, for four days. Louis, my friend, I am a scientist to the core, and a Catholic to the core, educated largely by Benedictine monks, and will not be caught out by trivial theological sophistry. Go back to your ideas about miracles and clarify them to yourself, and when you know what you want to say, you may be able to explain clearly why the Resurrection “had to be” instananeous.

So the Resurrection “had to be” not quite instantaneous because Jesus “must have taken a few seconds” to power up. Perhaps you are correct. The God I believe in does not have to take any time at all. He may have allowed himself to revive over 36 hours, individual cells reawakening in succession until he simply got up as from a bed, or he may have vanished in an instant, the space he occupied being as instantly filled with air, or left as a vacuum, or he may have exploded in a burst of radiation, which was just enough to have an effect on the Shroud. He may have caused the dead of Jerusalem to do any of the same, and then sent them all back to their graves, or he may have made the people of Jerusalem think they had seen their forebears when in fact they had remained peacefully in their ossuaries. He may have reconstituted himself instantly, and sat in the garden for the rest of the night waiting for Mary Magdalene to turn up, or he may have not reappeared until just before she arrived. Somewhere along the way he provided clothes for himself. Perhaps while he was still in the tomb, perhaps after he re-materialised. He may have done any, all or none of these things. That’s who God is. From a scientific point of view, none of them is open to inquiry. I do not know what the Resurrection was scientifically, or how long it took. Nor does anybody else, nor does it matter. In 1984 the Anglican Bishop of Durham attempted to explain this in describing the resurrection as “so much more than a conjuring trick with bones” and a few years ago Pope Benedict showed a similar lack of enthusiasm for “the mere resussitation of a corpse.” Frankly, in the opinion of most modern theologians, all as orthodox as the Pope, the measurable, physical events of the morning of the first day of the week after the crucifixion are trivial compared to the meaning of the Resurrection and the effect it had on the disciples, whatever actually occurred.Best wishes,Hugh","date":"October 14, 2014 at 5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/12/just-the-facts-maam/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"\"Just the facts, ma’am.\""},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"It’s true that I did not expect a wholly congratulatory response from Louis, but he might have made more of an attempt to support Prof. Fanti, or point out my errors, than he actually did.1) Demonstrating an instantaneous image-forming mechanism by a dead body on a cloth is a task that can be easily handled by Profs.

Stepping out of my depth here, but when did that stop me before?When somebody uses a word to describe a particular circumstance, it is natural to assume they were using a word particularly appropriate to that circumstance, and so, if there is an appropriate English word, to use that in translation, regardless of what the original word meant to the person who used it. Any cloth used in connection with a tomb may thus be assumed to mean ‘shroud,’ ‘grave-clothes,’ ‘winding-sheet’ or similar.However it is not clear to me that there is a Greek word which is particular to a cloth in a tomb. Searching for a Greek word meaning ‘shroud’ in http://www.lexilogos.com/english/greek_ancient_dictionary.htm (which uses Liddell & Scott, the dictionary I used as a child among others), I cannot find one. There are references to words meaning ‘shrouded in gloom’ or ‘wearing a black shroud,’ and so on, but these seem to me to be largely figurative. Thus ‘entypazo’ means ‘wrap up’ but not specifically a dead body, and ‘melanonekyoeimon’ means ‘shrouded in black,’ but as far as I can make out the base words are black-corpse-wearing, with no specific word meaning ‘shroud.’ None of the words given in association with ‘shroud’ is anything like ‘sindon’ or ‘othonia.’This makes me feel that neither ‘sindon’ nor ‘othonia’ nor, in fact, any other word, had any specific reference to grave clothes, until, being thus applied by the evangelists, they acquired one.So what did ‘sindon’ mean? To find out, we need to look at every example we can. Starting with Herodotus’ Histories, the Babylonians strain their fish stew through sindonos, people sleep wearing clothes or wrapped in sindonos, Egyptian mummifiers wrap bodies in bandages (telamon) made of sindonos, and wounded warriors are tended with the same. Lucian says that the Eyptian God Anubis wears sindosin, and Polybius says armies signalled with coloured sindona. It is fairly clear that the word had no immediate connection with the grave.‘Othonia’ seems to mean very much the same. People wear it, wave it about, and let the wind blow on it to move their ships.I think therefore, that Charles is perfectly correct in supposing that even a post-33AD Greek text that refers to sindoni or othonia need not necessarily be referring to grave clothes, but that Daveb is also correct in that in the context of the empty tomb, they almost certainly are referring to grave clothes.The grey area lies in the use of these words in the context of relics, but not specifically in the context of the tomb. It might be argued that since the word othonia only occurs in the bible in the context of the tomb, it carries that context automatically. Sindon is also used for the garment the young man in Gethsemane left behind, so need not, and might refer to a different relic altogether.Now back to my laboratory…","date":"June 11, 2014 at 9:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/11/anticipating-the-conference-dan-scavone-on-evidence-of-the-shroud-in-edessa/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Anticipating the Conference:  Dan Scavone on Evidence of the Shroud in Edessa"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think the good thing about the conference (and about the BSTS Newsletter, among other things), is that it forces people to collect their thoughts, arrange them and present them, with relevent references and logical inferences, in a way that an online discussion, or responding piecemeal to a blog, never quite manages.

As I understand Dan’s object in supporting it, this blog is for people who want to find out more about the Shroud, authentic or not. From time to time we do get comments like: “It’s obviously authentic, so stop bickering,” and a very few that say: “It’s obviously a fake; get over it.” But as these commenters have little to add to the discussion, they usually don’t stay. Even those who are wholly convinced in principle one way or another contribute variations on the details. The non-authenticists are not unanimous on the provenance or manufacturing method, and the authenticists tie themselves up in knots (literally: see recent discussions) about how the Shroud was fixed or draped over the body.Ideas from science, fringe science and frankly whacky science are all grist to the mill, and given an honest review. I have now read several articles from Nature Photonics, and am much more familiar with the work of Seok-Hyun Yun and Malte Gather, who published their experiments with light induced laser emission from GFP in living cells in 2011. I can’t find any further research on the subject. Quantum bioholography failed to find any scientific acceptance by the end of the 2000s, and seems by now to have been rejected as a serious study even by its previous adherents.ELF waves, on the other hand, could be a promising field of research and you may find yourself particularly welcomed by daveb, who has long championed Giovanna de Liso’s work on imaging during earthquakes. You are no doubt familiar with the WHO paper: Extremely Low Frequency FieldsEnvironmental Health Criteria Monograph No.238, which leads to some interesting speculation.Colin was quite correct to point out that comparing Joseph Accetta with “a person in a mental institution that keeps banging their head against a wall all day” was a hostile, ignorant and unwarranted attack, but generous enough to suggest that you “hang around.

Except, of course, that it could be contaminated with oil. Do we have to go through all this again? How much oil would be needed to contaminate it, and why did the carbon-dating laboratory firstly not notice it and then say they were unable to remove it? Everybody else can, with fairly simple procedures. Perhaps there was a Soviet spy at work here as well. And what sort of oil? And when. Say modern, say olive, say 15%. That’s a lot of contamination. If from petroleum, of course, it would make the date much older than its real date, not younger.Then we hear that Max Frei had identified pollen. Again? Really? Is his report available? Is, it, like his Shroud report, so specific as to species as to call his entire oeuvre into question? I read, repeated on the internet 60 times, that pollen from “Quercus caliprimus” was found on the Sudarium, a tree that only grows in Israel. Only there’s no such plant. It’s Quercus calliprinos (the Palestine oak), and it grows from Northern Algeria to Turkey and beyond. It is so closely related to Quercus coccifera that I have no doubt its pollen is indistinguishable from it. Quercus coccifera grows commonly in Spain.

Science establishes its norms precisely by making them widely known, and consequently accepted. Miller, Webb and Dickson’s vague and unsubstantiated hypotheses of Quantum or Embryonic Bioholography are certainly not established facts, and neither is any of the subsequent dogma about the body being a crystal and so on.“Human DNA is made up of a gel like liquid crystal that can emit microscopic laser light. That is a fact, that is not speculation.” That is certainly not a fact. It is wholly untested. In this context, it is not even obvious what is meant by “microscopic,” or “laser,” or even “light.” There are good, widely known and widely accepted definitions of these words, none of which currently apply to any results achieved from experimentation with DNA.“Bottom Line: Russ B’s Image Formation theory is correct: Jesus was lit up like a Christmas Tree.

Few of these remarks are as black and white as they are represented here, and the weight attributed to their relevance is indeed somewhat subjective. So, the conclusions I seem to have come to:1) Yes, the waiving of the protocols was a pity, and caused a lot of bother, but it has no relevance to the actual dating procedure.2) Results from a single sample are satisfactory as long as it is representative. It is true that this has been seriously questioned, but it not true that it has been discredited. On the whole, I find insufficient reason to doubt that the sample was indeed representative.3) The chi-squared test is a measure of similarity, it not something you pass or fail. If there is a 95% or greater chance that two results are of the same provenance, the hypothesis that they are is, by convention, considered established. If the chance is is less than 95%, then the hypothesis is not considered formally established. This is not the same as saying that it has been disproved. The figure for the Shroud is 94%.4) Riani and Atkinson’s chronological gradient is significant, and indicates some discrepancy along the length of the radiocarbon sample strip. It does not discredit a medieval date at all, nor demand any interweaving, although some contamination may be possible.5) Rogers’s discovery of various contaminents may contribute to an understanding of the chronological gradient described above, but is not in itself any evidence of an interweave. Some of his conclusions, such as the use of a water-soluble gum, lack credibility.6) The reasons I do not believe in the reweaving are described above and in detail elsewhere. It has not been demonstrated at all.7) The presence or absence of vanillin could be significant, as I have already said.8) Gilbert Raes discovered no differences between his sample and the Shroud. Later studies on the Shroud itself have attempted to show that the cotton content, if any, of the rest of the Shroud does not match that of the Raes sample. Whether the cotton is relevant or not is, as I have said above and many times before, dependant on rather better estimations of its quantity and location than have been determined so far.In conclusion, I wholly deny that I am the slightest selective in my collection of evidence. I would go so far as to say that I am the least selective of anybody commenting on this site.

As the Nature paper, and you, have correctly pointed out, my last sentence in this section should read “The figure for the Shroud is considerably less.” (I’m guessing about 85%).However, my principle point remains the same. Assuming the same sample was being tested, the probability of obtaining the Shroud results by chance is only 1 in 20. This is not a very high probability, and it falls below the chi-squared 0.05 value of 5.99 (95% sure that the values are from the same sample). As I say, this means that the hypothesis that the measurements are from the same sample is not considered formally established. This is not the same as saying that it has been disproved. As I say above, there is still a good chance that they are.I cannot agree with your next point, which is that the Riani/Atkinson findings mean that the medieval date must be rejected altogether. A row of dates along a plank of wood, for example, also show a chronological gradient, but are not, on that basis, rejected altogether. The reasons for the gradient along the wood are different, and better understood, but the principle is the same. Riani and Atkinson’s findings say nothing about the overall accuracy of the date of the Shroud.I do agree that the reason for the chronological gradient is not understood. It may be due to minor contamination, such as a water-fast red madder dye added to the Holland cloth to make it match the Shroud. Why Rogers’ water-soluble gum would have been applied I can’t understand. As you say, that would have been washed off by the cleaning process. It would also have been washed off by a shower of rain.

What I am querying is the convention of the 95%/5% pass/fail criterion. The 0.05 border between acceptability and rejection is a sensible, if conservative, way of deciding whether a hypothesis should be accepted or rejected. If rejected, of course, that does not mean it is wrong, simply that it has not been confirmed to be right, by this convention. This is exactly the case with the Shroud, and presumably the reason why the peer reviewers of the article in Nature did not reject the results out of hand. [Semi-relevant illustration. My father was a quality assurance officer for Royal Naval ordnance. For him, the 0.05 convention was far too lax, given the possible outcome of an unpredicted explosion. I have a feeling that his pass/fail criterion was 99.9%/0.01%, or 0.001. It may have been tighter still.]“We know that there is a row of dates along a plank of wood, because trees grow for several years – contrary to the Shroud.” Yes, of course. My point is that three furniture dates of 500, 505 and 510 years, found from samples along the length of a piece of wood, are not rejected out of hand as the ‘contamination’ of more recent C14 is well explained. Further investigation into the Shroud might permit one to assess (oh, alright, guess) the maximum level of contamination (rather less than the 60% required to make a 1st century cloth give a 13th century date), and therefore the youngest possible age of the youngest section, from which, given the date spread, the age of the other two sections could be calculated. I would be happy to give a worked illustration of this if anyone thought it worthwhile. But your last bit is not reasonable. Rogers identified a water-soluble gum, which does not, to me, make sense. I do not know why anybody would put water based paint on an area he knew would be held by many hands. What, I ask myself, was the gum for? I confess that this area of speculation was brought on by pondering on Roger’s discovery of red madder and this gum. He thought that the madder was a dye on interpolated threads, to make them look more like the Shroud. I can’t find any interpolated threads, so I speculated that the madder was a dye on the Holland cloth, to make that look more like the Shroud. Certainly a photo of the area after the radiocarbon sample has been removed is much paler than the exposed part – although some have suggested that this is due to a light-induced darkening of the Holland cloth with age. I do not know how the dye would have been applied, but I don’t think a water soluble gum would be a suitable agent.","date":"October 12, 2014 at 2:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/10/st-louis-friday-morning/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"St. Louis, Friday Morning"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“But they instead chose to pretend that nothing happened.” They mentioned the anomaly, and attempted to explain it by suggesting that the errors quoted by the laboratories did not reflect the overal scatter.

Shroudscope is a debating forum, where opinions and ideas are presented and discussed, for all the world to read. I rarely address any correspondent directly, precisely because my views are addressed to all the readers of this forum, not simply to the individual whose views I am debating. Nor do I try to guess what is going on in the minds of those I respond to; I reply to their words, not to their thoughts.Louis does make one sensible point above, which is that he is quite correct that I like to examine, in extreme detail, any evidence regarding the Shroud, and am usually prepared to go to some length to do so. I did buy Il Mistero della Sindone, and Prof. Fanti’s subsequent paper in Vibratonal Spectroscopy, and have commented on them at length, but must confess I have not shelled out the necessary for Sindone: Primo Secolo Dopo Cristo! as I really don’t know that it will be worth it. Like the previous book, it appears to be aimed at a popular market and as such will probably present conclusions rather than a good account of the research that led up to them. If a more detailed paper on the DNA findings can be found anywhere I will be pleased to review it for this forum.Meanwhile, we have Prof. Fanti’s quoted replies to Louis’ questions above. “When it comes to human mitochondrial DNA, distinct haplogroups have been identified, including R0, U2 and U5, and several H haplotypes. Haplogroup R0 occurs frequently in the Arabian plateau, especially in the local  populations of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan with its highest frequency in Yemen (30%), whereas the highest frequency of haplogroup R8 is found mainly towards East India. U sub-groups are widely distributed across Western Eurasia, North Africa and South Asia. The human mitochondrial haplogroups we found are compatible with the proposed temporal and spatial paths of the TS and the findings and additional clues present difficulties to those who postulate a Central European origin of the relic.”This statement in itself explains why I can honestly say I don’t know much about it. Among the mitochondrial haplotypes identified, some are thought to originate from the Middle East 60000 years ago. This tells us nothing. A huge proportion of Europeans and Americans would have the same. In order to comment sensibly, one would need a complete list of the haplotypes discovered, and the proportions in which they were found. Suppose, to set an extreme example, 90% of the haplotypes were H1b, and 10% from R0, U2 and U5 – that would be a good indication that the Shroud had never been handled by Hebrews or Turks at all, and is not ruled out by the statement quoted. The final clause: “additional clues present difficulties to those who postulate a Central European origin of the relic,” is interesting. I wonder what the ‘additional clues’ are. Perhaps they are indicative, perhaps not.

Not even Jesus’ nudity. I think this is a question of social convention and taboo. I haven’t quantified this, but I guess that a naked Jesus occurs more often in books than it does in public display. The biggest taboo, however, was (is) not nudity but genitalia, and with few, perhaps deliberately provocative, exceptions (eg Michelangelo), even when Jesus is clearly nude, some diaphanous wisp of material, or the angle of his legs, or his hands, preserve his modesty. Buttocks, I think, were not a problem, but rarely appear – on anybody – because a picture of someone shows his front, not his back. Obviously, if a decision were taken to have a front-and-back portrait (which is, I agree, probably unique in early art) of a naked man, then buttocks would be inevitable.2) I see no kink. I see what I would expect if somebody wanted to show one foot placed over another, and the shroud wrapped up over the heel of the lower foot.3) The blood chain is, I agree, an oddity.

The section of the quoted paper which is devoted to Hebrews is entirely uncertain about the identity of the author. One of their research methods makes it closest to Paul, but well outside the range of certainty of the rest of his letters, and another method makes it closest to Luke, but again, with minimal certainty. Their conclusion is: “This would appear to favour the traditional belief that Paul is the author. However, the corresponding Mahalanobis distance is longer than the furthest distance between any of Paul’s known texts and their stylometric average, suggesting the link between Paul and the Letter to the Hebrews is weak.” This is emphatically not a ‘scientific identification.’ The authors then pose two questions: Was Luke involved in a translation? and, Was the letter written by somebody else entirely? These are not ‘conclusions,’ which mark the end of an investigation; they are questions which they hope somebody will use as the beginning of an investigation.The body of texts used to try to identify Paul’s writing style are in Greek. The letter to the Hebrews is in Greek. If Paul normally wrote in Greek, then he didn’t need a translator. If he normally wrote in Hebrew (or Aramaic), then the rest of his work also needed a translator, and the discrepancy between the ‘main corpus’ and Hebrews could simply be a matter of changing translators (John Mark to Luke?). If he normally wrote in Greek, but needed a translator into Hebrew especially for the letter to the Hebrews, then our text (in Greek), if not his original, must be a retranslation back into Greek again. By another translator? Weird. Whatever the solution, Maryam Ebrahimpour et al’s paper does not claim to provide it.Now, moving on to (sorry Yannick) the assertion that the “official teaching of the Catholic Church” is that “the Resurrection should not have left any kind of physical proofs.” Is there any substance for this assertion? As a Catholic myself, I would find it very difficult to accept that the Resurrection didn’t happen at all, although as a scientist I’m personally inclined towards a more metaphorical than literal interpretation of that word. However, if the resurrection was a physical event, then something scientifically explicable but at present unknown must have occurred, and whatever it was may have left traces. Whether Jesus just woke up, pushed off the shroud and walked out, or suddenly dematerialised and rematerialised elsewhere, or exploded in a shower of rainbows, some evidence of what occurred would have remained, and may still be evident today.

In this context the term monoatomic (or monatomic) gold is wholly meaningless.There is no such stuff, and it is consequently impossible to treat anything with it. The most honest description of it I can find on ebay (uk) is from Healing Mountain, where 20g costs £25. That compares well, does it not, with ordinary gold bullion, where 20g costs about £550? Being a nutritional supplement, Healing Mountain is obliged to list the ‘ingredients’ of its “MONATOMIC WHITE POWDER GOLD M-State ORMUS 20g most POTENT Form.” This is what it says: Nutritional Information. Each gram contains: Silicon dioxide 100mg. Magnesium hydroxide 900mg.” Yup; each 1000mg of pure monatomic white powder gold contains 1000mg of sandy magnesia, and not a trace of gold at all. (Healing Mountain sells a variety of quantities and shapes of bottle, and the ‘Nutritional Information’ is not always given, and is not always honest where it is given (70% monatomic gold, 30% magnesium hydroxide, for example), but I believe the more credible versions!)Somewhere on the internet I found the entertaining comment that monatomic gold was such bad pseudo-science that it even discredited other forms of pseudo-science.But wait – are not Scientists at reputable research universities investigating the properties of monatomic gold, so it must be true?

I do not believe they exist. Nevertheless, I suppose we have to have a look at it. The first 17 pages are a Chemistry lesson and not patentable. On page 18 we begin a 21-step guide to preparing G-ORME. The first 5 steps, involving dissolving gold in acids and then boiling them away results in “substantially pure” Gold Chloride. It would be easier and cheaper to buy it commercially, or to pass chlorine gas over gold powder. Next we add salt and nitric acid and eventually achieve Sodium-Gold-Nitrate. Why not just buy some Gold Nitrate to start with? We are told that this is monoatomic Sodium-Gold-Nitrate. There is no justification for this at all, and it does not seem to mean anything anyway. It might mean that we now have more or less pure Sodium Nitrate, with the odd single gold atom relacing the sodium here and there. At least it explains the white colour. Boiling gold powder in Sodium Nitrate solution might have a similar effect anyway. We have reached step 12, and could have saved ourselves the trouble. At step 13 we make sure there is no acid still present, and at step 14 we add water and the pH immediately becomes 1. Not in my laboratory it doesn’t, but in this one the Nitrate disassociates from the Sodium Nitrate leaving… er… Sodium? in water?  Bash on, regardless of the chemistry. We now have pure Sodium-Gold which immediately becomes hydrolises to Hydrogen-Gold. This is white? I don’t think so. Wash off the acid, decompose off the Hydrogen and what have you got? No, not monatomic white gold powder, but exactly the same elemental gold powder you started with.We have reached page 21 and embark on pure alchemy. First we check that a pile of dirt contains no gold. How? Then we mix it with salt, bromide, sulphuric acid and anything else handy and electrolyse it. The result is gold. Sorry Angel, but this is utter tosh. If gold could be extracted that easily there would be huge factories bubbling away all over Arizona grinding out bullion like gravel.There is no such stuff as monoatomic gold.

The Instructructions specifically begin with 50mg of pure gold.– “With respect to Sodium Nitrate, it is highly soluble in water; therefore, Hudson would have rid the crude product of Sodium Nitrate.”  –  Both Gold Chloride and Gold Nitrate are highly soluble in water. Water to a dry mixture of both will create a solution of both; some unreacted gold might remain.– “Yes, the pH would be 1, because the nitrate is still attached prior to the addition of water. Nitrates are very acidic.”  –  No, nitrates are common salts. When dissolved in water they do not produce acidic solutions. – “So, this step, adding water, dissociates the nitrate and it is indicated a small amount of nitric acid still remains.”  –  What does this mean? There was no acid to start with, and there will be no acid remaining.– “Therefore, the solution should still be acidic to some degree.”  –  No, it isn’t. Most common garden fertilizers contain nitrates. Why not dissove some and test it with a pH tester?– “The NaAu hydrolyzes with the water and dissociates to form HAu.”  –  No, it doesn’t. No, it won’t. Evn if it did no light-grey HAu will be formed as HAu is extremely unstable and decomposes to gold at the drop of a hat.There is nothing in any of the above to suggest that monoatomic gold is formed.– “I fail to see where you are getting a pile of dirt on page 21.”  –  A frivolous way of saying “300g of dried material” which is what Hudson starts his electroylsis with.– “There is no dirt and there should be at least a gold atom, since Hudson started with gold.”  –  No, I have moved on to the Electrolysis Experiment, which specifically starts with “material assayed by conventional techniques to show no gold present.”– “Unless I’m missing something, the experimental procedure appears to be correct. One would have to repeat the experiment to see if the final product is obtained.”  –  You can indeed carry out all the steps in the experimental procedure. What you can’t do is interpret the results of he chemical procedure in the manner described. A flick through YouTube shows lots of people churning out ‘mono-atomic gold’ in their kitchens. None of their final products is anything of the kind.– “Any patent involving superconductivity has to be approved by the Department of Defense before it can be issued….. So it was sent to the Department of Defense. They refused to let me file world wide.”  –  This is flim-flam. Hudson doesn’t claim a US patent, but he does claim an Australian and a British one, both of which do not exist. US Patents are regularly granted for advances in superconductivity which work. Any rejection of Hudson’s applications was not for some implied secret defence reason, but because it is nonsense.– “He speaks of the Middle East and the Egyptians and this monoatomic gold powder that is a superconductor and may have been how Jesus levitated.”  –  So he does, and so do dozens of similar people with mystical ideas and no evidence.Enough already.

The marks here are on a body only a few centimetres high, so the fact that there are only 20 or so, each one representing a cut about 10cm long, should not count against them. However, it is quite wrong to call them “realistic.” Both the Ducio and Colombe paintings are considerably more so. Lorenzetto and Huguet also attempt realism, while Memling, for example, clearly stylises the effect. De Wesselow is probably correct in saying that artists deliberately shied away from any confusion with the “five wounds.”Next, however, we are told the artist accurately depicted the Roman flagrum. Regular readers will know this is one of my hobby horses, but the flagrum in the accompanying photo was not “recovered from the Roman City of Herculaneum”, and nor does Wilson, to whom this absurdity seems to be attributed, say it was. I believe it was made specifically to fit the marks made on the shroud in the early 20th century.Then we move to the “smoking gun”, which is the unnatural depiction of “curved fingers” apparently mimicking the epsilon blood stain. It is clear that neither Jones nor Hamon are familiar with many others of the 150 or so illustrations in the Stuttgart psalter, the majority of which contain unnaturally curved fingers, a hefty proportion of which are in exactly the same configuration as they are here. Several of these show people pointing to their own head, which I believe to be a convention representing thinking, and perhaps by corollary, guilt.Although it is a wonderful find, neither the psalter, nor this particular picture, are anything like evidence for an early provenance for the shroud.","date":"October 22, 2013 at 6:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/stephen-jones-on-the-stuttgart-psalter/","cat":"flagrum","title":"Stephen Jones on the Stuttgart Psalter"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No, Max, I haven’t tabulated the whole psalter, but then, neither have you.

Not a smidgin. The crease is modern. No old painting can be based upon it.I don’t understand your reference to the Manopello painting, which probably dates to the late middle ages. Now, why don’t paintings show a uniform collection of abnormalities? Are we to suppose that every pantocrator painter had personal experience of the shroud, and they each picked out their own selection of imperfections? Some went for forked beards, some didn’t notice that the beard was forked but did spot a minutely visible imperfection in the weave between the eyes? The arbitrary selection of this or that characteristic is, I think, the main argument against these Vignon markings having credibility.The St Catherine’s Pantocrator is one of the earliest. It seems to come from Constantinople in the 6th century. It shows no sign of having been derived from the shroud. The major features, the droopy moustache, the long pointed beard, the round shape of the hair around the head, and so on, bear no resemblance to the shroud. Even the asymmetric eyebrows and the bag under the left eye owe nothing to the shroud.Dozens of Pantocrators seem to be derived from this model. Christ wears a blue robe, carries a bible in his left hand and blesses with the right.The other Pantocrator you link to is in Delphi, in Greece. This one is also typical of its group which represent a more graphic and sylised art form, with lots of well defined lines on the forehead and neck. There is possibly a greater case to be made here for derivation from the shroud, but I still don’t think the case holds water. You make the interesting comment that copying the facial hairstyle of a holy image is “splitting hairs.” This seems strange when artists are supposed to have studied the shroud in such detail as to copy minute imperfections of the weave as if they were essential parts of their reproductions.All in all, I’m still not persuaded that the “Vignon markings” have any cogency.","date":"April 26, 2014 at 3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/26/how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"We had a look at this last December (The Sciatica Effect, Dec 28 2013), and I queried the existence specifically of the celebrated “double crease” under the chin, said to be the source of so many of those Byzantine portraits of Christ with a double line at the top of his tunic. I now have a copy of Paul Vignon’s 1903 book Le Linceul Du Christ, in which he makes no remarks at all about markings. He includes, however, several good reproductions of Pia’s photos, and the double crease simply isn’t there. It must have arrived as a consequence of the rolling up of the shroud between 1898 and the 1931 Enrie photography.As for the two strands of hair, they do not appear at all on the shroud, and I am not at all persuaded that they are representations of the epsilon blood-drip ‘translated’ into hair.Three of the Vignon markings, which appear to exist on the shroud, are really only one, namely the open square, the shallow V inside it and the droopy V below it. The square is easily the most visible, but apart from the Roman catacomb painting (what was the shroud doing in Rome, one wonders?) most of the paintings which are claimed to have derived from the shroud seem to have omitted the square altogether in favour of the V-markings. How odd.As for the nose and cheeks, there is, very properly, no sign of any bruising or battering on the Byzantine portraits. They nearly all show their subject turned slightly towards, and illuminated by, light from the right. Not only does this reduce the area of cheek visible on the right, but also means that there is a greater area of cheek, and more shadow, on the left. I do not feel this establishes that this asymmetry in the depiction of the nose and cheeks is derived from the shroud.As for the moustache and beard, it is obvious that the general shape of a Byzantine moustache looks nothing like that of the man in the shroud. His is quite bushy and bulges around the nostrils; theirs consists of two long straight diagonals with a little tuft in the middle. If anything, this style of moustache clearly shows that these portraits are not derived from the shroud. Byzantine depictions of beards, surely the most prominent and distinctive of features (I have a beard myself, dear reader) are split about 50/50 forked or pointed. Not a clear derivation from the shroud, in my opinion.","date":"April 26, 2014 at 1:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/26/how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"ah… and I was determined not to say it again… wise words, daveb…","date":"April 26, 2014 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/26/how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Fantastic collections of images, but I’m afraid the Vignon markings are simply not as convincing to me as they are to others. Maybe it’s the flowers thing all over again. OK lists the famous 15 marks, two of which, as I have clearly established, weren’t present on the Shroud at all. (To claim that just one of the three distinctive creases of the Enrie photo, as bright as the two big ones bracketing the face, was somehow omitted by Pia because of the lighting conditions is really not justified. and there is no reason to claim that all the blood trickles were somehow converted into two little wisps of hair).The point about the Vignon markings is that they appear on images and “cannot be artistically justified except with reference to the shroud.” And there’s no doubt that the Roman catacomb portrait does have a big meaningless square between the brows. It is, however, the only instance of that in all the images I have seen (It is not one of OK’s examples). All the others, and every instance of the supposed “forehead streak” and most of the “V”s, are perfectly reasonable deliniations of the supra-orbital ridges and bulge of the forehead, and need owe nothing to any supposed imperfections on the shroud.A very few images, it is true, have well defined, and apparently meaningless well defined curvy lines, loops and triangles drawn across the brows, and these, I agree, need explaining, but they look nothing like the faint imperfections on the shroud. OK, like most “Vignon spotters” somewhat arbitrarily assigns these to “topless squares,” and the two supposed V’s within and below them.A single casual glance at the image on the shroud shows a roughly rectangular face with no visible ears, a bushy moustache and a short, stubby, split beard. Astonishingly, in spite of their alleged study of minute differences between single threads, not a single one of OK’s images can be so described. Even more surprising, perhaps, is the fact that Vignon’s own sketch (if so it be; it seems the most reproduced) of his markings looks nothing like the shroud face either!

He implies (forgive me if I misunderstand) that adding any natural texture to the brow is a subconscious reference to some misunderstood marks on the shroud, while I disagree and think that it is simply what it appears to be and nothing more. The whole point about ghe Vignon markings, as I understand it, is that by making no artistic sense,  they prove that they must have derived from some other tradition which the artist didn’t understand. And I have already agreed that the style of pantocrator with the distinct wavy lines and triangles is one such anomaly. What I don’t agree in that case is that these designs are obviously derived from the shroud.I’m afraid I’m not taken in by any of OK’s superpositions. All faces have eyes and mouths, and any two full face portraits can be related so that these features coincide. The fact remains that the most obvious and easiest to copy features of the face on the Shroud are not reflected in any of the Byzantine portraits, with their ovoid faces, with narrowed chins or beards, droopy moustaches and visible ears. I don’t expect them to be photocopies, and no doubt most of them were copies of copies, but it is disingenuous to claim on the one hand that the copiers were only vaguely accurate about what they were depicting en large, but fanatically careful to include minute details – for mystery’s sake.

It is undoubtedly true that the weave of the Shroud is extraordinarily rare, in the sense that there are vanishingly few examples of it in any century, 14th, 1st or 21st, and that it requires a four-heddle loom, which is a more complicated piece of equipment than a one-heddle loom. However, having set the warp threads up in the heddles, the actual manufacture of the cloth is a relatively simple and tediously repetitive affair. There are dozens of examples of more complicated weaves from before and after the 14th century involving elaborate diamond patterns that required considerably more skill. So, more expensive than ‘normal’ cloth, certainly, but not fabulously extravagant.The second point depends on what the ‘forger’ was trying to do. As a 14th century artefact, the Shroud was manufactured towards the end of the great Byzantine relics craze, and most of the alleged remnants of the time of Christ, from the manger to the cross, were already well established. The chances of an adventitious painter persuading the Dean of Lirey to try to pass off a quick monocrome brass-rubbing as holy relic are, I suspect, small, and I do not think that was the Shroud’s route to fame. It is far more likely that it was made for a liturgical purpose, almost certainly connected with Easter, and acquired its relic status fortuitously. That’s why I have kept the word ‘forger’ in quotes – I do not think the Shroud was necessarily originally meant to deceive people into thinking it was authentic. And if it were created for a liturgical purpose, then selecting a rich and rare material does not seem unlikely.","date":"July 21, 2015 at 3:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/21/a-rare-piece-of-cloth/","cat":"history","title":"A Rare Piece of Cloth"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"In principle yes, although there are a number of points about which we disagree, particularly concerning the appearance of the shroud when it was first displayed, and others about which I do not think we can be as certain as Charles appears to be.","date":"July 21, 2015 at 4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/21/a-rare-piece-of-cloth/","cat":"history","title":"A Rare Piece of Cloth"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"This is getting quite exciting!

As usual, Stephen relies almost exclusively on secondary sources, so it is difficult to track down the truth of any of his references, but here we go.Point 2. With the greatest respect to Mme Flury-Lemberg, I do not go along with the selvedge argument at all. The ancient Egyptians, 1st century Palestinians, and medieval weavers were quite capable of producing cloths of various widths, with selvedges both sides. If you wanted a 110cm width of cloth, you made a 110cm width of cloth, you didn’t get a 3m width of cloth and cut a strip off it or out of it. The only reason for such an action would be if you wanted a 110cm strip of cloth, and the only one available was a 3m wide one. However, if this was the case, you’d be in a hurry, and surely not bothered about matching the selvedges, especially if it meant putting in an ugly seam all the way down the cloth. You would cut the cloth to the required width and hem the edge, so there was no ugly seam down the length of the cloth. This would be more attractive to look at and easier to do, than cutting out a strip and resewing the edges, giving you the seam down the middle. Furthermore, all you would need to do to the remaining cloth would be to hem the single cut edge, rather than having to hem both cut edges as in Flury-Lemberg’s scenario. I’m afraid I think her idea very far-fetched, and would need evidence that it was a common practice, or even a rare one, before I gave it credence.Points 3 and 4. Even if the strip removal thing were granted, the cloth from which it was removed was not necessarily originally 3m wide with 1.9m removed. It could have been 2m wide and a 90cm strip removed. Although I do not know about how wide medieval looms could be, they certainly had them at least 2m wide. Viking looms are described as “typically” 2m wide.Point 5. The fact that the Shroud could possibly have been woven originally 3m wide, had a 10cm strip, followed by a 190cm strip cut off, and then the 10cm strip sewn back on, does not mean that this scenario is at all likely, let alone proof of anything.While we’re at it, few of the rest of Stephen’s facts bear much scrutiny either.The dimensions of the Shroud equate to “8 x 2 Assyrian cubits, the standard unit of measurement in Jesus’ time, even among the Jews.” There is no evidence for this at all, and some to the contrary.“The reason for such wide looms was to produce the tunica inconsutilis, or seamless tunic, which was particularly fashionable in the Roman period.” I do not know about Roman fashions, but unless a tunic is woven as a tube, or consists of nothing more than a long thin sheet with a hole in it, it has to have at least one seam to hold the sides, or one side, together. If, as I suspect, the word seamless means that it was woven from just one piece of cloth (which may have had seams at the sides), then a strip about 14 ft long and 3 ft wide would be about right, but this would not be a 3 ft length cut from a piece of material 17 ft wide, it would be a 14 ft length cut from a piece of cloth 3 ft wide. I do not think the wide Egyptian loom had anything to do with the Roman  tunica inconsutilis. Is there any evidence for this?“The unusual stitching, binding and finishing of the selvedges is, like the stitching of the seam joining the sidestrip to the main body of the Shroud, known only from the first century Jewish fortress of Masada.” This statement is a familiar misinterpretation of Flury-Lemberg’s opinion that the stitching at Masada means that the Shroud could have been contemporaneous, not that the stitching is not known anywhere else, or that it must have been.Curiously, although Stephen professes not to read this blog, I’ll bet a pound to a penny that a diatribe against me in response to this comment will appear on his blog within the next 24 hours… (4.41pm UK time)","date":"September 21, 2015 at 10:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/21/another-overwhelming-evidence-argument/","cat":"history","title":"Another Overwhelming Evidence Argument?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Part 3 of the article introduced me to ivory carvings for the first time.

The trouble with a really well explained hypothesis is that you get drawn into it! So, several squandered (but not necessarily wasted) hours later, have you seen the photos of the Lirey badge at http://www.culture.gouv.fr, or http://www.photo.rmn.fr, or (sorry) http://www.sindonology.org, where some details are massively enlarged. I found them by Googling “Lirey Cluny pelerinage” so as to avoid English. Some aspects of your interpretation of your photo will need adjusting, I think, especially the “air-hole in the barbecue” and the “bushes around the feet” ideas, which are, at least to me, quite obvious flaws or damages rather than intentional markings.Another thing I’ve noticed is the so-called “instruments of the passion” which supposedly fill in the gaps between the shields below the image itself. On the far left and right we have two clearly mismatched poles of some kind, which even your photo suggests are the spear and the scourging pillar. At least one whip is very evident, and the wreath could at least be as easily of thorns as well as laurels. All that’s missing is the nails, which may have been under the box in the bit of the circle that’s broken off. Would the relic, fake or otherwise, of a man roasted on a griddle, have included these symbols?More. Looking at the “chain” I do agree that it looks helical (your word), but still dispute that it looks anything like a chain. More like a thick rope? The stains across the back, and the wriggly bits around the feet (dorsal image) do look a bit like unravelled rope, and suggest to me that whoever made this badge did not make it from direct observation, but from notes, and maybe a sketch, that he took away before making the mould from which the badges were made. As for his figures – well, I don’t know if I could do any better when each is barely an inch long. It’s not clear to me whether these badges were made of liquid tin/lead poured into a mould, or hammered like a coin. One of the websites shows a picture of the back of the medal, which may be indicative, but I don’t know of what! Anyway, it was clearly made in a workshop, and a certain amount of licence (and simple forgetfulness or ignorance) must be allowed for. A less contentious example is the depicted size of the sheet, which is held by two people standing quite close together, an impossibility if it really depicted two life size men.Now that I’ve browsed this entire blog (and I do think it’s excellent, even if reciprocal ad hominem insults don’t, to my mind, enhance the respectability of either antagonist) I gather you’re firmly on the side of the scorch-mark hypothesis. For all I know you might be right, but surely to produce the shroud by heating a specially made life-size image to near red heat, transfer it to a sheet, wrap the sheet around it and then unwrap it to reveal the scorch (or any variation of procedure that would produce a similar image) would have been quite unnecessarily complicated, in an age when any old wreath of thorny foliage could be, if properly attested, considered the genuine crown of thorns, and any old tunic the genuine robe of Christ? What made pilgrims flock to look at the genuine this or that wasn’t, I think, so much the object itself as the provenance, which also needed to be prominently displayed, preferably covered in big red seals.","date":"October 10, 2012 at 10:26 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/comparison-of-lirey-badge-cluny-medal-depicting-the-shroud-of-turin-in-the14th-century-with-the-1865-forgeais-drawing-for-open-discussion/","cat":"arthur_forgeais","title":"Comparison of Lirey Badge (Cluny medal)  depicting the Shroud of Turin in the14th century with the 1865 Forgeais drawing – for open discussion"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I enjoyed the exploration, but you’re surely clutching at straws here.

Guerreschi and Salcito (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo4.pdf) show a picture of the niche in the wall where the silver reliquary was kept, secured, according to tradition, by an iron grill that needed the attention of a blacksmith before the shroud could be rescued. It is quite high in a wall above an altar, and Guerreschi speculates that the fire started in some combustible material below the niche. We know very little else about it, or how far it spread (to the roof for instance?). Assuming the temperature of the fire managed to reach the melting point of silver at all (which is far from obvious), and assuming that the reliquary was, in fact, made of silver (which is also far from obvious), the niche in the wall was effectively an oven. I do not think it necessary that the inside of the reliquary reached a uniform 900 degrees C, but at least a small part of it must have done, or the silver would not have melted through. Guerreschi demonstrates quite convincingly that the hole in the shroud could not have been made by molten silver, but more likely by a solid, such as a roof panel, fallen in after its fastening (to the rest of the reliquary) had melted or burned away. Remarkably, the water stains associated with the burn holes are extremely minor (nothing like the much bigger patches associated with Guerreschi’s ‘urn event’), and suggest an attempt to quench the heat with as little water as possible, rather than pouring buckets of it over the reliquary and in through the hole. Much important information is lost to us and remains highly speculative, such as how the reliquary (hot or cold) was removed from the chapel, and how the shroud was removed from the (burnt away? badly damaged?) reliquary. However, in view of all the above, it seems to me extraordinary, and verging on incredible, that the temperature inside the reliquary did not get high enough to make any difference to the material of the shroud at all.","date":"February 23, 2013 at 7:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/22/david-rolfe-we-need-you/","cat":"history","title":"David Rolfe we need you"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"In view of Yannick’s emphasis of the uniformity of the shroud, I wonder if he has anything to say about the great fire of 1532, when the shroud, folded into 32 layers, was subjected to the temperature of molten silver in its reliquary.

There are a number of possible answers. So, for a moment, just suppose….1) Shrouds are not long and thin. They are roughly the length of a body, and about three times as wide, for ease of wrapping. So why forge a long thin one?a) It was cut from a bolt of old cloth, and easier to keep in one piece than cut and resew.b) It was specifically designed to fit a space (behind an altar, say) which was about 4m long.2) Most relics are so obviously fake that it seems unnecessary to create such a ‘realistic’ looking one. Why bother?a) It was a question of ‘my shroud has to be better than your shroud,’ and there were plenty of unmarked shrouds already in existence by the 13th century.b) The turn of the 13th/14th century was quite late in the relic craze era, and new ones had to be increasingly realistic to avoid the scrutiny of the Lateran Council.c) The Shroud was originally as obviously fake as any other, but the painting has deteriorated so badly that only a stain produced by its medium remains.3) The Shroud is unique in all art (apart from art derived directly from it) in showing two images of Christ simultaneously. Why did the forger do that?a) If the dimensions of the cloth were already determined, then one image would be rather small for the cloth. If it lay in in the middle, it would beg the question “where exaclty was Jesus lying?” and if to one side it would look dreadfully unbalanced. If you decided on two, then a front and a back seem the logical design.4) If I were laying someone out on a long thin shroud, I would keep the spare roll at the feet end, so that it could be peeled back for a last look at the face before leaving the tomb. Why are the shroud figures head-to-head?a) Because the two heads of Christ would then form the centrepiece, immediately above and behind the tabernacle, and not the two feet ends, which seems a little disrespectful.Does the concept of a fake make any more sense now?

As usual he invokes the term “pseudo-skeptic,” and has claimed to adhere to Marcello Truzzi’s definition thereof. Truzzi says that scientific skepticism is the demand that ideas satisfy a burden of proof before being granted validity, whereas pseudo-skepticism is a simple assertion that a belief is factually wrong without providing any proof thereof.A more easily understood definition of a pseudo-skeptic, provided here by Charles Freeman, is the someone who claims that they are sceptical about something when in fact they believe it to be true.Neither of these, of course, describes my position at all. Like all good scientists, my exploration of any idea is rooted in an attempt to disprove it, so that by rejection of the null hypothesis, it can be demonstrated valid.In the case of rigor mortis, I cannot say that I can reject the null hypothesis. I have no pre-existing determination rejecting authenticity (quite the reverse), and I do not refuse to accept the findings of those pathologists who say that if the image on the shroud is that of a dead body, then it looks as if it is in a state of rigor mortis. So it does.But note the conditional. The pathologists quoted above had two considerations. Firstly, could the image on the shroud have been produced in any other way than by being wrapped around a dead body, and secondly, what does the image tell us. Of their expertise as to the second I have no doubt, and neither should anybody else (even though they disagree quite markedly about things like the Space of Destot and the cause of death, which alone should make impartial observers aware that authority and experience alone are not infallible). As to their expertise on the first, of course they have none. The statement: “the shroud must be genuine because we don’t know how it could be faked” is no more valid than the statement: “the shroud must be fake because we don’t know how it was caused naturally.”Proof is a very strong word in the scientific world. So much so that scientists seldom claim anything as proved. The nearest they get is a Law, such as the Law of Gravity, but even a Law is only a consensus of opinion about a description of the natural world that seems to hold true within a sphere of investigation. Where, or when, it is found wanting, it is amended or rejected.In the Mathematical world, proof is irrefutable, provided that certain axioms are accepted. The only way to disprove a mathematical proof is to reject the axioms. If that can be done (and it often is) then the proof disintegrates.In the legal world, proof is an everyday occurrence resulting in a conviction. Whether X killed Y is not a matter of global scientific consent, but simply persuading twelve people that the evidence of guilt is beyond reasonable doubt. In borderline cases this doubt may depend as much on the emotions of the jury and the persuasiveness of the lawyers as it does on the evidence. I have said before that I think the main difference between my approach to the shroud and John Koch’s is that our ideas of what is proved and what is not are based on different methodologies.As for my “only support,” I knew nothing of Michael M Baden before this post. I do not know whether his appointment as CME, his subsequent dismissal, his successful claim for wrongful dismissal and the subsequent overturning of his claim on appeal had anything to do with his ability to decide whether a picture of a body shows rigor mortis or not. I believe John Koch is simply trying to blacken his name, in an attempt to discredit his scientific judgement. As it happens this seems unnecessary as he does not seem particularlty committed either way.","date":"February 9, 2014 at 8:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes I do.

First he estimated the volume of the cross based on the weight he guessed Jesus could carry and the average density of pinewood, which seems a curious way of making a wild guess, and came up with a volume of about 179 000 cm3. This would make a cross 4m high, 3m across, of planks 25 cm wide and 10cm thick, which is absurd. He then added up a handful of relics whose dimensions he also largely guessed at, and arrived at about 4 000 cm3, which seemed to him far too few, so he arbitrarily multiplied this by ten, arriving at about 40 000 cm3. To consider any of this serious archaeology is risible. (Information from http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/facts/fm0150.htm)But undeterred, we will do the same! I’m going for a cross 3m high (including the bit in the ground) and 2m wide, of planks 20cm across and 5cm thick. That’s 50 000 cm3, which fits with the smaller volume above sufficiently well. Wikipedia gives the dimensions of six pieces, and mentions two other sites claiming to have entire ‘wings’ each. The six pieces add up to about 3000 cm3, and the two wings cannot be less than another 10000 cm3. That gives us 37 000 cm3 to account for. On ebay as I write, there are about 70 pieces for sale. They are mostly in the form of crosses made of two splinters, say 10mm and 7mm long, and cross section 1mm – say 0.01cm3, or 100 to the cubic centimetre. How can we estimate the total number of these purported relics around the world? I’m guessing 1 for every ten thousand Catholics – so a total of about 100000 relics, say another 1000 cm3’s worth. I’ve now accounted for 14 000 cm3 of my original 50 000. It seems that de Fleury was correct.But wait… Grzegorz Górny’s new book “Witnesses to Mystery” says that “the True Cross was made of Black Pine – pinus negra,” and claims that one of the ‘wings’ of the True Cross (in Spain) was found to be made of Cupressus sempervirens (Mediterranean cypress), while Wikipedia says that four of the “ten particles with surviving documentary provenances by Byzantine emperors” in Europe are made of Olive. What’s more, Black Pine does not grown in Israel.The message is that just because there aren’t, in fact, enough fragments of the True Cross to build a battleship doesn’t of itself mean that any of them are genuine.","date":"January 13, 2014 at 3:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/10/how-many-more-purported-pieces-are-out-there/","cat":"history","title":"How many more purported pieces are out there?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Selling relics?

Normally it just means hair, and far from being a rare word, it occurs frequently, meaning the material of the hair itself rather than as a description of the top of the head generally. It found a Latin equivalent in ‘coma,’ which also just means hair, not long or decorated.In a literal translation, St Paul says that for men to have hair is a shame, while for women it is  glory. As this is, as it stands, absurd, an adjective has been assumed, normally ‘long,’ but not illogically ‘decorated.’ Possibly an original adjective has been lost in copying. So although I shy away from your dogmatism, there is sense in your suggestion.Interestingly, the Latin Vulgate amends the meaning slightly. For a man: “si comam nutriat ignominia est illi”, and for a woman: “si comam nutriat gloria est illi.” ‘Comam’ here, as anywhere else in Latin, just means hair; it is the ‘nutriat’ which gives the passage sense. If a man nourishes his hair it is an ignominy, but if a woman nourishes hers it is a glory. That makes a certain sense, and could indeed apply to ‘attending’ to hair in a decorative sense, as well as applying some sort of lotion to try to make it grow.On the whole, then, I think I agree with you! But it does not pay to be too dogmatic: that plays into the hands of your critics. The reference to unkempt hair in Plutarch’s Cicero comes not from the ‘κόμης’ but from the qualifying ‘ἀνάπλεως,’ for example.","date":"May 16, 2014 at 8:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/14/jesus-long-hair-again-and-again-and-again/","cat":"history","title":"Jesus’ Long Hair Again and Again and Again"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"He might.

Why not draw a better one?As for the statements about the movement of the Shroud between 1357 and 1388, there are at least three sensible possibilities, one of them being yours. However, in a comprehensive encyclopaedia I think there is a duty to be a bit more precise about the reason for your choice. I tried all over the place to justify it from primary sources, including Ian Wilson's more recent books (1998 and 2010) where he doesn't mention it, and his seminal 1978 book, where he doesn't mention Anthon (Just my luck if he mentions both in Holy Places, which I haven't got with me!) I was sorry not to find M. Bergeret's paper online, as that might quote a 14th century source. Perhaps you have a specific source, or perhaps you were making an educated guess - and a perfectly good one it is - but I think you should make clear which.As for the date of Jeanne de Vergy's marriage to Aymon IV, I think Crispino is guessing that the indulgences granted in 1357 were in order to celebrate it. What makes you think it was in 1359? You're probably correct about Guichard d'Anthon - it may well be that Anthon Haute-Savoie was named after Anthon Isère, but the castle of the former is not otherwise associated with the chatelain of the latter.

Most of the so-called Vignon markings are stylistic variations of earlier models dating from before the time of Christ, or reflections of contemporary hair styles. As I commented on an earlier post, some later Pantocrators do have a distinctively odd wavy brow ridge and downward nose loop which does not seem artistically relevant, and perhaps someone more au fait with Byzantine art can say what it symbolises. I do not think it derives from the Shroud, however, as the most distinctive bridge-of-the-nose irregularity is the famous open square between the eyebrows, which is completely ignored in favour of some barely visible triangles except in one single example, the St Pontianus wall painting, whose artist can hardly have had the Shroud before him as he worked.And I’m sorry, clublu22014, that I do not see the “obvious miracle” that you do.

The general layout of these types seems fairly rigid, and sometimes a misunderstanding of the epitome give rise to absurdities, such as the ridiculously sloping coffin lid upon which the angel sometimes perches in “Three Marys” paintings. Does anybody know of a work (Belting perhaps or Shiller?) which gives a ‘family tree’ of these styles? It would be good to see whence and when each one appears to have originated. From what I gather, “Entombment” icons preceded “Man of Sorrows” icons, which seem to have derived their right-sided spear-wounds and crossed wrists from them. Some icons seem to have derived from sermons delivered by particularly notable worthies rather than directly from the bible, but I’m not sure about the authority there is for that.

It was torn up into 6 or 7 pieces and scattered. Two pieces of the long robe were returned to the cathedral at the beginning of the 19th century. Expert examination has shown the cloth to be about 2000 years old and or Near of Middle Eastern origin.”A blogger (http://catholicismpure.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/our-ladys-veil-two-tales/) writes:“The veil itself is more than six metres long and made of silk. Scientific studies have shown that it is of Syrian design, of fine quality and can be traced to the first century. If indeed it was the original Veil of Our Lady it has probably been extended and embellished over the centuries.  It had once been depicted as a tunic (Sancta Camisia) but when this was unwound it was found to be a Veil, or a long piece of cloth rather than a tunic.”The best information I can find is a book “Sea of Silk: A Textile Geography of Women’s Work in Mediaeval French Literature,” by E. Jane Burns (try Google Books) which says everything there is to be said about the relic. It’s made of silk and covered in embroidery. She quotes Yves Delaporte; La Voile de Notre Dame, and another source (which Google books won’t give me!) saying that “according to an analysis in 1927, the embroidered cloth is Syrian work from the 8th or 9th century.” And: “More recently, Annemarie Weyl Carr has identified the tiraz-like fabric now called the Virgin’s veil as Byzantine, dating it to the tenth or eleventh century.”Sadly I suspect that Kevin Stuart Brodie gets his information from “The Kabbalah Code: A True Adventure” by James Twyman and Philip Gruber, which does date the santa camisia to the first century, but is, like all books entitled “a True Adventure,” really not much more than a romantic fiction.Incidentally, it appears that the single sheet in your photo above is, in fact, just a dust and light excluder.

Fr Puech has, probably correctly, explained that the two spellings can only both be correct if they indicate the name Qopha, which is sufficiently far from Qayyapha, or something similar, for identity with Caiaphas to be rejected. However, Helen Katherine Bond points out, with photographs, that the inscriptions are somewhat clumsily executed, nothing like the elaborately decorated front of the ossuary, and appear to have been added as afterthoughts, after the ossuary had been placed in its niche, as the inscriber had to jam his hand into the narrow space between the ossuary and the wall of the tomb to scratch the letters. In this case the possibility that there was a simple misspelling of one of the names cannot be easily discarded. Neither she, nor I, nor, I dare say, the museum of antiquities in Jerusalem, would go to the stake in favour of authenticity – it is, as I say, a question of the weight one gives to a piece of evidence – but that’s the reason I do not concur with Fr Puech’s conclusion, however much I agree with his linguistic interpretation.","date":"August 4, 2014 at 12:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m sorry that having no expertise on the matter I have to fall back on Helen Bond again.

Maier goes on to quote the usual historical evidence from Roman commenters, of which only Josephus’s is really evidence of Jesus rather than of Christians as a sect, and Maier does not see fit to mention that perfectly sensible people have queried most of his evidence on reasonable grounds. The idea that only 30 years after the resurrection there was a sufficiently substantial Christian movement in Rome either to burn to place down or to be blamed for doing so and executed in their thousands (“an immense multitude”) is a priori a little far fetched, although not of course impossible.

When Kenneth says he has come across his various methods, may I ask in what publications? There has been a great deal of speculation about Roman scourging, but most of it is not based on much.My advice, for what it is worth, is not to look at the Shroud for information about Roman scourging. Start with Roman authors, most of whom write about different contexts than 1st century Judea, but give some ideas about what happened, in different circumstances, and more particularly its cultural significance. Then look at the very few contemporary illustrations, mostly on coins, and the one single piece of archaeological evidence, which was sold on eBay a little while ago. (The metal rod with little chains and bells dangling from it which you can find in Antiquities books, is now, I believe, thought to be a horse ornament, not a model flagrum). Finally look at what happens when modern people flog themselves, which happens every Easter in Mexico, the Philippines, and so on.Having a better working knowledge, as it were, you can then turn to the Shroud to see how it might fit in to the pattern. Fancini’s diagrams are interesting, but seem to suggest whole squads of torturers equipped with an assortment of different instruments taking turns on all sides. Vignon and one or two others actually made scourges to fit the marks, which later commenters, thinking they were based on other archaeological sources, then used to prove that the marks were clear evidence of the use of that type of scourge. There are two kinds, one with the dumb-bells longitudinal with the thongs, and the other with them transverse. They can’t both be correct, if either. It is quite interesting and thought provoking to sketch in lines from the general direction of the marks as if they were radii, and find the approximate centres of the circles on either side, which have suggested to some people the different height of two scourgers. You could also make something appropriate and see how good a scourger you would be (but use a tree rather than a person…). You will find that it is remarkably difficult to flog someone while standing behind them to their right (assuming you are right-handed). Perhaps the Romans employed pairs of both right and left handed experts to administer their punishments, or the right hand man used back hand.Finally Colin makes a perfectly valid point about the fact that so many of the marks are clearly distinct that they can be counted with some precision, when lumps on the end of strings tend to clump together into an amorphous contusion. Someone on the internet has made his own ‘replica’ of a flagrum looking a bit like a garden leaf-rake, with the thongs attached to transverse bands to separate them, which, he declares, is the only design which could result in such distinct wounds.","date":"August 10, 2014 at 6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/09/request-for-help-can-you-point-me-to-some-information-on-roman-scourging/","cat":"history","title":"Request for Help:  Can you point me to some information on Roman scourging?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"There are no sources; that’s my point.

Furthermore, have you looked at, for example, the Shroud Scope image of the back of the head? All the bloodstains have a curiously bubbly appearance, whitish in the middle and darker round the outside, which I attribute to lumps of encrustation falling off, or possibly remaining on a ‘body’ when the cloth was peeled off.

Searching for images of 1st or 2nd century coins gives us no images of cap-like crowns, and paintings of king Abgar in state, rather than as a military leader on his coins, give him an ordinary circlet crown like any other king.

It is one of the earliest “Three Marys” I’ve come across (about 1130 or so), and reputedly made in Jerusalem, for the Queen of Jerusalem. As such, the illustrator had a better chance than many accurately to depict the holy sepulchre as it then was. Following the earliest traditions, the tomb is shown as an upright door, and the “stone rolled away” is presumably the square block upon which the angel is sitting. Later (Western, apparently) tradition adopted the box-like tomb, and the tilted lid for the angel to sit on. Where this came from I don’t know, but the illustration before the Three Marys in the Melisende Psalter shows the Harrowing of Hell, where the dead are emerging from boxes rather than doors.Points to note are the appearance of the marble tombs – reddish, and with irregular Xs to depict the marbling; and the shroud and headband, which appear to be transparent. There is also the pointing angel (with a sensible four visible fingers) and the white grid under the cloths, which appears in one or two 12th century images before disappearing for ever.Also relevant, but not terrible helpful so far (to me anyway) are the “Angel’s Stone” and the “Stone of Unction” which are in the church of the Holy Sepulchre to this day, which may be the origin of some aspects of the illustrations.I think that out of context, the similarities mentioned in so many posts might lead me too to suppose that the Pray manuscript is evidence of the contemporary existence of the shroud, but the more I find new (to me) illustrations of medieval psalters the less I am convinced.

The excellent Shroud Scope is available to everybody, and the Shroud app to those with an iPad, and I simply can’t find any “depressed centres” or “raised edges.” Can anybody else?2) “Under ultraviolet light each scourge mark can be seen to have a “halo” of lighter colour surrounding it.” The only UV photos I have are from Miller and Pellicori’s paper, but their photos blow up very well. The whole of the back of the image shows general background fluorescence, and the scourge images do not show any particular extra brightness around them. Does anyone find that there are?3) “These halos were chemically tested and found to be blood serum which is left behind after a blood clot forms.” Really? Who by?4) “This is further evidence that the Shroud could not have been created by an artist in the Middle Ages because that knowledge about blood clot structure, let alone a microscope and an ultraviolet light source to see them, did not then exist for many centuries into the future.” Dripping blood onto a cloth does not require any knowledge at all. Children with nosebleeds do it all time.5) “Each one of the over 100 scourge wounds on the Shroud matches exactly what would have been caused by a type of Roman flagrum buried in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79.” I cannot find any evidence at all that the reconstructions of Roman flagra, of which there are two main modern versions and several interpretations from the 19th century, are based on any archaeological artefacts. Has anyone seen any? Rich’s “Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities” (1874) has an illustration “copied from an original found in Herculaneum” which appears to be made entirely of metal and looks nothing at all like more modern versions. Where is it now? The words “flagrum”  and “plumbatum” bring up nothing in the Archeological Museum of Naples or British Museum websites. In the absence of anything to compare them with, it cannot be said that any of the marks on the shroud “matches exactly” any original flagrum.6) “So a fourteenth century or earlier forger would have had to possess a faultless archaeological knowledge of a first century Roman scourging with a flagrum.” As it happens, the flagrum held by one of the scourgers in the 14th century Buoninsegna painting in Jones’s article is an almost exact copy of his reconstruction of a flagrum just above it, only with four thongs instead of three. Faultless archeological knowledge.7) “But the scourge-marks on the Shroud are depicted with a realism that is unknown to the art of any period.” For “realistic” scourge wounds, try “Philippines” “flagellation” on Google images.

As I mentioned, it is possible that the body was washed clean shortly before being laid on the shroud, and that the scourge marks on the back are the result of wounds reopening, or simply seeping. These might be characterised by a lack of red blood cells and an excess of plasma (as you might find by removing a dressing from an open wound before it heals). On the other hand, a forger with a bowl of blood (maybe from a patient who had recently undergone bloodletting) would find he too would have to use it quickly before it too became more plasma than red cells.

Fred Zugibe, for example, wrote an entire paper entitled “The man of the shroud was washed.” I don’t want to get into a “My medical expert is better than your medical expert” squabble, but, as I say, they do disagree, sometimes profoundly.","date":"July 16, 2013 at 4:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Blimey Max!

The famous Funeral Prayer, however, is written in a much neater and clearer hand than the writing on the pictures, which is almost indecipherable. And although the Funeral Prayer is in Hungarian, I think the writing on the pictures is in Latin. Although the whole codex is clearly an important collection, I cannot find any books or online articles which treat it as a whole, which I find extraordinary. Wikipedia tells me it also contains a missal, a mystery play, songs, laws and a list of kings. Any or all of these might have some relevance to the interpretation of the pictures.

Such a process would only affect the surfaces in contact with the cloth (which is why the backing cloth under the Shroud stayed white) and liberally scatter cotton, dye and gum over the margins of the shroud.Needless to say, all this gunk was removed and had no effect on the C14 dating.","date":"January 21, 2014 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/20/the-idea-of-something-being-authentic-is-just-too-powerful/","cat":"history","title":"The idea of something being authentic is \"just too powerful\""},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The raison d’etre of the BSTS is to investigate the Shroud in all its aspects.

Israel’s three cubits are called‘medium cubits’ in historic reference.  The three ‘medium cubits’ are differentby an approximate half digit.      The shortest cubit is the first or former cubit from Moses’ time.  This was thecubit of the First Temple (2 Chron. 3:3).  As this is the cubit given by Moses, theTabernacle was based on this cubit.  The obtained measures are 42.857142 cm.       When the Jews returned from Babylon they brought with them two measures:the small and large cubits.  The second temple was built using the small cubit.The large cubit was used daily and became the standard cubit of Roman times.      The obtained measures of the small cubit average 43.7 cm.      The obtained measures for the large cubit average 44.5 cm.”I cannot find from where Dickinson derives his claim that there was an international standard unit at all, nor why he should think it was an ancient Assyrian one.

Like a couple of other researchers, Baimas Bollone postulated, but did not test, that the red colour of the blood might be due to bilirubin. Bilirubin, as we know, is orange, not red. The Goldonis took his idea a stage further by adding bilirubin to blood to observe the effect. Even at “5 times greater than the normal physiological concentration” no colour change was observed until a set of samples was irradiated for 6 hours with UV light, when all concentrations went “bright red.” They postulate that UV rays degrade the bilirubin into lumirubin and isolumirubin. Lumirubin is normally yellow. The rest of the Goldonis’ paper is not completely clear to me. They seem to suggest the shroud blood only looks red in sunlight (not in artificial light), as a response to solar UV, which would normally be insufficient to have an effect. However, if blood is irradiated with neutrons, it appears to become more sensitive to UV, the red colour of their samples becoming obvious after only 30 minutes instead of 6 hours. They attribute the nuclear irradiation of the shroud to the resurrection.The Goldonis’ claim, that the shroud blood is especially red by UV radiation from the sun, is in direct contradiction to Pellicori and Miller’s findings that the blood did not fluoresce under UV light at all.Proponents of the forgery theory usually quote the unnatural colour of the bloodstains as an argument in their favour, and so far, those in favour of authenticity have yet to refute their argument.","date":"March 25, 2013 at 5:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/22/three-new-shroud-of-turin-websites-to-watch/","cat":"history","title":"Three New Shroud of Turin Websites to Watch"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thibault!

If the first, then how did it get wet again, and if the second, how did it stay wet for so long? The nakedness – while it is true that only Michaelangelo shows genitalia, a large number of paintings show a naked Christ whose modesty is protected by something, maybe a wisp of very unrealistic cloth, or a raised leg. Remarkably, it is the icons made before 1300 that nearly always show a properly loin-clothed Christ, while the paintings after 1300 more often show a naked body. If the relative proportion of naked to clothed images alone were a true reflection of the provenance of the shroud, one would have to say that it was more likely to have appeared in mediaeval times than in antiquity.None of these, I agree, constitutes proof of inauthenticity; but all of them cast doubt, as least to my mind, about genuineness. I must remain, for the time being, undecided.","date":"March 26, 2013 at 7:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/22/three-new-shroud-of-turin-websites-to-watch/","cat":"history","title":"Three New Shroud of Turin Websites to Watch"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"What I find fascinating about the shroud, Don, is that while every piece of ‘evidence’ that the shroud is a fake turns out to be readily disputable, so does every piece of ‘evidence’ that it is genuine.

That’s 7 folds altogether, and it is not difficult to achieve, although it does crumple the shroud to the very limits of foldability, and leave it looking more like a flattened tube than a neatly folded cloth. For that reason the casket is not a very good box for storing the Shroud in, although, if the shroud needed a box, and that were the only box available, it would have done.A few posts ago, OK and Mario Latendresse had an interesting discussion about the sources of the story that Othon de la Roche had something to do with the Shroud, which I am not qualified to judge, but I do note that regarding “family tradition”, all Allesandro Piana had to say about it was this: “As far as the label put on the coffer, according to which the Shroud was in Ray-sur-Saône castle in 1206, it refers to an hypothesis guessed years ago from local historians, Dunod de Charnage and Perreciot.

I am interested in her reference to Lazarus, who had no sindon or othonia, but was tied in keiria, which were definitely long and thin, like bandages (or tapeworms, suggest Liddell and Scott). Fulbright suggests Lazarus was trussed like an Egyptian mummy, which I should like someone to comment on – it does not seem to have been standard practice, judging from the few other burials we know about. Kim Dreisbach seems to think that the keiria were used to secure a sindon to the body, which leads to some interesting speculation about the contortions the risen Lazarus went through to free himself of his shroud without untying the keiria.In an astonishing piece of synchronism, I was just reading Fulbright’s section on byssus when a chapter all about it was read on the radio. It came from ‘Spirals in Time: The Secret Life and Curious Afterlife of Seashells,’ by Helen Scales. She does not think that the word byssus referred specifically to sea-silk much before the 15th century. Nor, she finds, is sea-silk byssus particularly diaphanous, describing the numerous samples she handled as ‘fluffy’ and ‘woolly,’ and not at all silky. A glove looks ‘thick and itchy,’ and a lady’s purse is a ‘furry’ object ‘that looks rather like a Scotsman’s sporran.’ The fibres are very light, though, such that if you hold out your hand and close your eyes you can’t tell when a clump of threads is placed on your palm.","date":"August 5, 2015 at 5:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/05/when-is-a-sindon-not-a-sindon/","cat":"history","title":"When is a Sindon Not a Sindon?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“Judeans prior to 50CE were buried in a set of clothing used as shrouds (layers of clothing used as shrouds were found).” Not necessarily.

However David Mo is correct (again) in implying that the Khirbet Qaazone burials cannot be considered in any way indicative of normal Jewish burial practice and it is true that Fulbright misidentified the site.

You explained earlier that in John 11:44, which is about Lazarus, the word “σουδαρίῳ” (soudarion) could have referred to a large sheet which could enwrap a whole body, and justified this by saying that the “ὄψις” (opsis), which was covered by the soudarion, can mean any form or shape, and was not restricted to the head. So far so good. However the soudarion of John 20:7 is specifically said to be around the “κεφαλῆς”, which can only mean the head. This calls into question your derivation of soudarion from the Arabic soudara. Your suggestion “the Johannine word “soudarion” is not derived from the Latin sudarium but from the Aramaic sudara (the latter is used several times in the Palestinian Targums of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh and refers to an all enveloping wrap or cloak (used to sleep in too)” is ingenious, but not, as far as I know, supported by anybody else. The Jewish Annotated New Testament (ed. Amy-Jill Levine, Marc Z. Brettler) thins that sudara means a male head covering, and wikipedia (yes, I know…) on Sudra thinks that “Aramaic: סודרא; Sudara, is a traditional ancient Jewish headdress” which is surely less than a full body cloth.So, Max, I think you are completely wrong about the soudarion being a large cloth, and what’s more, everybody reading this comment agrees with me. But how can this be, when you’ve spent thirty years researching this very point, and I’ve spent ten minutes on Google? It’s all about evidence, Max, which I’ve given, and you won’t.

All I’ve been trying to do is to wheedle out of him just a teeny-weeny smidgin of evidence, and guess what, I think I’ve partially succeeded. Is your etymology for soudarium just a fancy? No, of course not, and look, now there’s some evidence to back up your idea. Now we can assess it.Jastrow’s ‘Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic literature.’ The entry from which you quote has the headword ‘סודר’, which Jastrow defines as “a scarf wrapped around the head and hanging down over the neck, a turban.” After various examples, a note at the end says: “[Latin sudarium is a phonetic coincidence with our word, from which it differs in meaning.]” The next headword is ‘סודרא’, as in Ruth 3:15, which is defined as the same, and several more instances of its occurrence are given, particularly referring to being strangled with one, and to its being wound around the head to form a turban. In this case, then, Max, you have muddled things up. For a start Jastrow does not think that soudarium has anything to do with sudara, and for a second, Jastrow does not think a sudara means a full-body sheet anyway.And does Bonnet-Eymard agree? I can’t find his paper, but note that Domingo Muñoz León’s book, ‘Salvacion en la Palabra’ has a footnote mentioning ‘une étude de Bruno Bonnet-Eymard […] qui voit dans le grec σουδάριον un décalque de l’araméen סודרא, au sens de “linceul” et non simplement de “mentonnière.” So it looks as if you’re correct there, although it must be said that Muñoz León doesn’t agree with Bonnet-Eymard.I think you and Bonnet-Eymard are out on a limb, frankly. The connection of sudarium to sudara is not established by Jastrow, and even if it were, sudara does not refer to a full-body cloth. The hope that it might is derived from the huge quantity of corn that gets dumped in it while Ruth holds it out, but the amount “six measures” is not given an actual unit. If it corresponds to a seah or an ephah it amounts to more than anybody could reasonably carry, and is probably a deliberate exaggeration as a sign of Boaz’s generosity. Other, non-biblical, references to sudara clearly deny its whole-body proportions.Back to Kornelimunster, and its three holy cloths. The linteum (described as the towel with which Jesus wiped the feet of the disciples) and the sindon are about the same size, about 180 cm long and nearly as wide, while the sudarium (prominently embroidered with the word Sudarium) measures 39 x 22 cm.

Anyway perhaps he was better as a sculptor. 14th Century sculpture, even more so than 14th century painting, was regarded more as a craftsman’s skill than a piece of individual creativity, and many masterpieces have unknown originators (usually now called: the Master of … this or that, such as the “Master of the Parement” who produced the astonishing Parement of Narbonne – in monochrome, no less).There are some good reasons for doubting that the production of the Shroud was 14th century, but they are by no means unarguable, and to suggest that it could have been is certainly not baloney.In my personal opinion, of course…","date":"September 10, 2015 at 6:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/03/colin-berrys-latest-and-greatest-is-it-enough/","cat":"3d","title":"Colin Berry’s Latest and Greatest.

The VP-8 was a clever machine for its time, and the thrill of seeing anything even resembling a face emerging from a flat background gave rise to wholly erroneous beliefs regarding the uniqueness, and the accuracy of depiction, of the image on the Shroud. In the cold clear light of 40 years later,  we can find any number of images which are as good or better than the Shroud at achieving some sort of 3D emulation, and it is obvious that the repoussé effect looks nothing like an accurately sculpted body.There have been several attempts to show that a draped cloth would allow better body-cloth distance / image intensity calculations, but they have all failed dismally in practice (see both attempts in Ray Downing’s video), and an assumption that the Shroud was completely horizontal invariably gives the best results. With the possible exception of Petrus Soon’s images, however, it has always been assumed that the body-cloth distance / image intensity relationship was linear, with a sharp drop off at about 4cm. Perhaps because of the difficulty of calculation, or the fact than none of the commonly used software provides for it, or the fact that such a method is even more difficult to explain using radiation or vaporograph hypotheses, but what has never been explored is the possibility that the relationship may not be linear at all.Petrus Soon’s website does not explain how he achieved the depth of field we observe in his images, and one may suspect that it was by art rather than science, but it is possible that he used a non-linear relationship between distance and intensity. If so, that was his true achievement, not any of the pseudo-holographic jiggery-pokery that followed.Finally, Dan has it the wrong way round in saying that the 3D effect “is the most important quality for knowing that these are not images formed by reflected light as a painter would envision or a camera would capture a human form.” By a country mile, the best explanation for the 3D effect as it is seen, and the easiest way of replicating it, is to take a photograph, or paint a picture, using reflected light from the same point as the camera, such as a ring flash, preferably from some distance away, as demonstrated by Isabel Piczek on the top of her ladder, of a model immersed in a coloured liquid so as to attenuate the intensity appropriately.Not that I think that was really how it was done, of course!","date":"September 27, 2015 at 7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/27/more-3d-discussion/","cat":"3d","title":"More 3D Discussion"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"That’s very interesting, Gabriel.

However, they act as a powerful disincentive for for the authenticist cause, as they suggest that your views are wholly subjective and have little basis in actual observation. A passionate faith in the Shroud is an excellent thing (although one wonders what its subject would make of such invective) but unless it is controlled, it loses any scientific credibility. Is it any wonder that authenticists find themselves fighting a rearguard battle when one of their more authoritative spokesmen can do no better than that?This is a pity, because you might have a valid point. However, as you have no idea what image Colin was using, your very precise “16-pixel smoothing for 306×72 pixel image” is mere guesswork.When I try to explore ImageJ I try to begin with the biggest image I can. I select the brighter of the della Rovere images above (I find a good one at http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_k-bPNZiL84A/SWTn3oN7FjI/AAAAAAAAATM/vwIRl6vP8lM/s1600-h/gbdrov.jpg) and enlarge it on my screen until the length of the Shroud almost fills the screen (I use a 13″ laptop). Taking a screengrab of that gives me an image of 1136 x 242 pixels. Feeding that into ImageJ and selecting the “Interactive 3D plot” option, I get a good 3D image with the following settings:Gridsize: 512, Smoothing: 4.0, Scale: 3.0, z-Scale: 0.1, Max: 100%, Min: 0%.I agree that this image may be an artifact of the software, especially as the painting seems to be completely flat and without shading. However, if I carry out exactly the same procedure with the Shroud (using the image at http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_2wiki5.jpg), with a screengrab of 1168 x 292 pixels, and exactly the same settings, I get a remarkably similar picture. In neither picture did I make any adjustment to the colour, brightness, contrast or anything else.The truth is that it would obviously be best if the Smoothing was zero, but the “noise” over the Shroud makes it almost unrecognisable in that case.So is there any validity to your claim? Well, yes. I have also examined my two screen grabs with a Smoothness of zero, in which case the elevation above the background appears in both csses as a series of needlepoints, but this time I used the Spectrum LUT option, made the z-scale 0.5, and adjusted the Max and Min values in an attempt to discern different heights of the needlepoints. Amost all the della Rovere needlepoints appear the same height, while the needlepoints of the shroud image do indeed show a variety of heights, lower at the edges of the image and higher in the middle.Both the VP-8 and ImageJ seem to have a smoothing function, which inevitably gives a slope even to sharp edges. Even at zero smoothing, the needle points in ImageJ appear as pyramids rather than rectilinear blocks. What we don’t know is how much smoothing has been applied to the VP-8 image; the observed curve of the legs and arms might be as much due to smoothing as to genuine image intensity. But then again, it may not.","date":"December 13, 2014 at 5:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I only follow some of this, OK. My images, as I said, were 1136 x 242 and 1168 x 292 pixels respectively. Obviously, the images themselves contain a certain amount of smoothing, as the alleged half-tone effect of the shroud has a “pixel-width” of a single fibre diameter, and anyway the shadows between the fibres would completely obliterate the image if a truly representative image were submitted to ImageJ. Although zero smoothing is not a good option for 3D visualisation, it is the only way of removing the artificial curvature to which you so objected in your black cube demonstration above, which is why I used it to explore the true variation in height of the image.  By using moderate smoothing, as I said, both Shroud and della Rovere produce remarkably similar images, both quite “life-like”.","date":"December 13, 2014 at 8:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Sorry, mysteriously cut off too soon!Anyway, it looks good when you use the “original colours” option, but then, most things do, regardless of the quality of the 3D rendering.

The ‘contour lines’ are perhaps 5mm apart. Had they been 0.5mm apart, the face would have been much more recognisable and smoothing would have been unnecessary. However, what I was showing was that it is possible to create a 2D brightness/elevation image which, when converted with appropriate software, actually looks like a head. The Shroud image cannot be made to do this, as it stands; it is far too flat. There are possible ways round this, as Mario has experimented with. If, for example, the Shroud 3D-Image were printed out by a 3D-printer in rubber, and the flexible sheet so printed were then curved (both longitudinally and latitudinally) over a solid oval template, then the resulting shape might resemble a head a little more. I imagine this is similar to what Soons and Downing were attempting digitally. There would be distortion of a different kind, but the overall shape would be a bit more realistic. This would be explained by authenticists in terms of the image being formed while the cloth was draped over the body, and not, as per Jackson and Piczek, horizontal. However then many of the distance measurements would be wrong, and the head have far too small a diameter to be a realistic image of a real person.You are of course perfectly correct that it is easy to do all this with hindsight, and that even if it were a medieval creation, it is unlkely that the artist was thinking in terms of 2D-3D image visualisation (or, for that matter, the power of the negative image), but it is sometimes assumed that the “incredible accuracy” of the 3D possibility means that it would have been “impossible” for an artist to produce such an image. In fact, as we see, there is no “incredible accuracy” on that score, and so an artist cannot be ruled out on those grounds alone. There are, I agree, no contemporary parallels, but if a 13th/14th century artist did envisage a sheet covering a body and did create an image based on how he thought such an image may have come about, the rather crude an unrealistic 3D effect we actually see is just what he might have come up with.If, on the other hand, the shroud was created by some form of emanation from a dead body, then so far (and Mario may well come up with an acceptable solution some day) the 3D image cannot be reconciled with any brightness/distance correlation yet proposed, without being considerably subjectively distorted to fit the preconception. I’m afraid I find Kelly’s last comment ironic. “I think even a skilled artist working a priori and with hand held equipment would have screwed it up somewhere, at some point-in the face, along the length of the body and some distortion/misalignment would be apparent.” To me, he did screw up, he did fail to appreciate a true brightness/distance correlation, and there is considerable distortion and misalignment, both in the face and along the length of the body.","date":"December 15, 2014 at 8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks, Mario. If I were an artist trying to represent a true body lying under a shroud, in terms of a brightness/distance correlation, I would be aiming to create something which (even though the technology to do so would not be invented for another 600 years!) would result in something like the top image if it were magically translated into a sculpture. If I ended up with something like the bottom image, I would realise I had not appreciated the true rightness/distance correlation, as the whole thing looks far too flat, more like a bas relief than a full sculpture.I have a great respect for your own paper “The Turin Shroud Was Not Flattened” which I think illustrates that human body measurements are not badly distorted if a sheet is assumed to be draped, more or less as flat as it could be, but left to settle under gravity, but you do not address the brightness/distance correlation in that paper, by which all points of contact would be equally bright, and the sides of the cheeks (for example) would appear as high as the bridge of the nose. I think you were thinking of undertaking such a study, but have not heard how it progressed.Given the wonders of digital imaging, it should be possible to create a digital body (rather as Ray Downing has done), drape, wrap or lay a digital Shroud over it (which appears in several animations), and then calculate, convert into a coloured dot and plot, the distance between the body and the sheet in hundreds of places.

If one has a problem with Charles’s quotation in relation to the Shroud, one has a duty to explain what it is, so that we do not simply revert to yes-it-is no-it-isn’t bickering. For me, the main problem with the painting hypothesis is, as Colin says, that after microscopic inspection of as much of the image as I can find (on Shroud 2.0), there is not a single speck of paint left anywhere at all. This indeed speaks of attrition of a most thorough and uniform kind, which I cannot attribute to rolling and folding even after 500 years. There is also the problem of the protein. As the gesso would have been held to the cloth with rabbit-skin glue or something similar, the presence of the one would seem to predicate the presence of the other.

His scorches, like the Shroud image, or Roger’s ink blob, are a uniform colour, only lighter or darker. His concentric circle illustration does seem to use colour, perhaps for illustrative purposes only, but the same effect can achieved by piling concentric circles of exactly the same colour on top on each other, and varying the brightness of each one.It may be the that difference in brightness is caused by variation in distance. In Colin’s scorches it is mostly caused by variation in pressure, and one might surmise a situation in which variation in temperature played a significant part. Other factors may also be possible, such as variations in the conductivity in the scorching object.  However, if we choose distance, we come across a significant question. Distance from what, to what, and in what direction? This has been explored, but not very deeply, and no consensus has been achieved even by brightness/distance devotees. Imaging software assumes two horizontal planes, representing maximum and minimum brightness, and builds its image between them, but few authenticists think that the Shroud was horizontal when the image was created. Attempts have been made to calibrate image intensity against a hypothetical body/cloth distance, always vertical, using photos of a body covered with a cloth, with some success, while the corona discharge hypothesis implies a “shortest distance” relationship, whether ot not it is vertical.Stan Walker, and also Todd earlier, falls back on the “if you can’t make one you must be wrong and I must be right” argument which it is surely time to retire.And I do hope nobody calls de Wesselow, Heller, Adler or any of the rest names.

That there is no direct correlation between intensity and distance is abundantly shown by simple 3D imagers such as the VP8 and ImageJ – and even they require a level of smoothing and z-axis adjustment which must be judged by the viewer. To create the three dimensional grid that Downing based his model on requires a great many assumptions and subjective overrides which it would be interesting to know. The first would involve deciding what exactly is meant by the cloth/body distance. The VP8 and ImageJ work from a horizontal plane, the darker the further. To get anything like a real head shape we have to assume that the shroud was in contact with the body at the hair, eyebrows, nose and beard (or at least equidistant from them) and so the cloth/body distance depends on the shape of the shroud. This shape has been brilliantly explored by Jackson, Lavoie, Latendresse and others, but is, in detail, quite subjective, as every time a sheet is placed over a body it adopts a slightly different drape. Following on from that, the problem of what to do about the folds of the drape, where there is too much cloth to fit neatly over the contours of the face, must also be considered, and this too is mostly subjective. Then there is the algorithm used to remove all the weave patterns and the various darker or lighter stripes that may be due to the bleaching process of the original flax fibres and the bloodstains.

I can only deal with a few here, and even then I must ask readers to check my sources for themselves rather than have everything laid out for them.1) The halftone effect is largely a myth.OK’s attempt to demonstrate the representation of the halftone effect on the Shroud is made using a scanned halftone image from the cover of a book. Actually even that doesn’t work very well, but it is hardly surprising that a halftone image has a halftone histogram. Now look at Mark Evans’ micrographs side by side. In spite of different exposure and development, it is clear that the individual fibres on the darker parts of the Shroud image are darker than the individual fibres on the lighter parts of the image. The idea that all the coloured fibres are the same colour, and that the darkness of the image is achieved simply by massing more of them together is quite simply wrong. But don’t rely on me, check it for yourself by screengrabbing the micrographs from Shroud Scope and laying them side by side on a Word document or something similar. The differences are obvious.2) The ‘banding’ between the cheeks and the hair is largely a myth.OK claims that there are two bands of lighter warp threads on either side of the face, and removes them with some digital manipulation to achieve his wider and more ‘realistic’ image. I invite the reader to try to track these light warp bands upwards and downwards beyond the extent of the Shroud face. It can’t be done. The two light bands are not a feature of the cloth, but a part of the image, and should not be treated differently by darkening them up.3) OK’s comparison between my examples of 3D qualities and the Shroud is grotesquely unfair.In Part 2, Slide about 18, OK places the Shroud and five examples of photos of forward facing faces lit from in front in a single group, and by manipulating ImageJ to suit the Shroud image as best it can, shows that the others are not as satisfactory as the Shroud image in 3D terms. This is disingenuous. Why manipulate all the images using the Shroud’s parameters? They are all differently lit and have different contrasts. If each of the photos is made the best of (as they were in the post where I originally posted them) then it is easy to see that they are at least as good as, or better, than the Shroud image.That will have to do for now. OK’s paper is excellent in many ways, and is particularly ccommendable for its clarity, detail and references. It is, however, very selective as to its evidence, and few of its conclusions are altogether justified. Do try my ideas out for yourselves, however, before agreeing or disagreeing.","date":"October 4, 2015 at 5:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Jumper and Jackson found that the VP8 image of the whole body was very unsatisfactory, looking distinctly “flat and stiff.” They made a full size physical replica of the VP8 image out of cardboard sheets, however, and by comparing its profile to that of a volunteer (in 18 places along the midline) they were able to derive the distortions to the x-y plane necessary for the z distances (derived from their intensity/cloth-body graph) to look more real. Draping a real cloth over a real body showed how similar their derived cloth was to possible actuality, but that part of their experiments was totally subjective. No measurements were made from the body of a volunteer to the surface of a cloth. It would be possible, I think, using a cloth of fine netting, through selected holes in which a thin probe, marked in millimetres, could be inserted, but to my knowledge this has never been done. Jumper and Jackson’s paper is an absolute model of scientific reticence and, as I said before, they are at pains to point out how far their results are from any ‘exact match.’ Here is an example of their meticulous prose: “These results demonstrate that the Shroud image has a 3-D characteristic in that image shading correlates with the distance between two surfaces, one of which can be interpreted as a body shape and the other as a cloth draping over that body shape.” Perfect.","date":"February 2, 2013 at 7:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","title":"Teaser of the Day (#3): Why many state that the Shroud is a 3D image"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, Giorgio, your image is a really good one.

The transmitted light photos OK shows above are spectacularly irrelevant. The banding they show is firstly as much due to the Holland cloth as to the Shroud (look at how the lateral ‘bands’ continue across the burn patches, where there is no Shroud at all), and secondly is not due to any variation in colour but entirely to the combined thickness of the two cloths at any one point.And yes, my 3D examples are much better than the Shroud, as I have shown several times on the blog.

You have spotted that my ears appear to be at the same level as my cheeks, and that the irises and pupils of my eyes are too sunken in, for example. However I do say that my photo is a much better 3D representation of a face than the Shroud is. Similarly, I do not say that there are no bands on the Shroud. There clearly are. What I do say is that these bands are not bands of differently coloured threads. They are made up of the different shadows of the two different directions of herring bone ribs, of clusters of threads of different thicknesses, particularly at the spines of the herringbone. They do not indicate that the cloth is differently coloured, so that some sort of correction factor needs to be applied to make the image more accurate. All that is needed to observe this is to magnify them using Shroud Scope – or better still Shroud 2.0.Furthermore, a photo by transmitted light owes rather little to the colour of the cloth itself. Even if every single thread were exactly the same colour, a transmitted light image would still show bands, as the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the thickness of the threads, which vary quite a lot.It is true that the fact that the Holland cloth is significantly banded (as can been seen by the bands appearing through the patches over the 1532 burn holes) and that those bands are clearly visible through the Shroud as well, does not preclude the possibility that the Shroud is also banded, but it does mean that the transmitted light photos cannot be used as evidence of that supposition.Finally, regardless of any of the photos or reproduction styles used, the half-tone hypothesis says that no image-bearing fibre on the Shroud image is lighter or darker than any other image-bearing fibre.

From about 32:44 we are introduced to the problem that the ribs of the weave, which mostly carry the image, present a highly corrugated surface when converted to a 3D image, and have to be removed by FFT, which searches for regular patterns and evens them out. The programme drifts off into history for a while, but the section concludes with more 2D/3D computer wizardry, using, guess what, the original image with all the weave marks left in. In the next section (45:59), there it is again, covering a 3D image. Was the FFT not a good idea after all? The weave reappears here and there throughout the rest of the programme.At 46:33, John Jackson describes how “on the top part of the body the cloth meanders over the body in some fashion” following the contours of the body. This is accompanied by an image of what looks like a layer of pastry over a fruit pie, without a single crease or wrinkle, just bumps over the protuberances beneath. This is not how a cloth performs, as we see later on. This is followed (from about 65:50) with a couple of ingenious experiments to show how intensity/distance relationships could be translated into 3D images, firstly assuming that Shroud was horizontal, and secondly assuming that it followed the contours of the body. The horizontal version wins hands down. With a horizontal Shroud “the result looks like a normal human face”, but the with the draped Shroud, “The face is distorted and flat, sunken in the middle and without a nose.” Oddly, the conclusion drawn from this is exactly the opposite of what has just been demonstrated. “Jackson has shown that the contours of the cloth are the source of Downing’s problem.” No, he hasn’t; he has shown that assuming the cloth to be horizontal gives the best 3D representation.Nevertheless, the next section begins assuming that the draped Shroud works best, and reproduces the previous experiment using a sheet. Actually it is obvious that they are using something more like a ball than a human head, as the nose clearly does not stand proud of the cheeks, not are the eyes sunken in (see 49:45). This time, although, the results are completely different. Although they do not notice that big folds and creases in the cloth lift large sections away from the body, now all the hideous distortions observed the last time they tried it have disappeared, and “the figure looks more human”. Nor do they explain how they achieved the computerised figure from a cloth draped over a body. How were the body/cloth distances computed, and why is there no “mask of Agamemnon” effect, so that the hair strands down the sides of the face are not absurdly far apart? I’m afraid that I do not believe that this new image had anything to do with body/cloth distances. I suspect the Shroud face was simply ‘draped’ by computer, vertically downwards on to a pre-existing digital head, and gently tweaked to get it to fit. That this is more likely is shown by the graphic at 50:05, where the contours of the 3D image rise vertically from the 2D image; they do not open out or unwrap.By 1:06:55, we abandon any pretence of objectivity. “For the computer graphics team, the search for the Shroud’s hidden face has been purely scientific’, but science can only lead them this far. To finish the face in the Shroud requires the skill of an artist.” At 1:08:00 we see the 3D shape determined by the previous manipulations transformed again to make a more realistic contour for the eyebrows, as if somehow the original image was created through the eyebrows, which left no trace themselves.Later on, copious blood marks are added without specific reference to those all over the Shroud (although the epsilon appears prominently, there are no brow ridges to have caused it), but no suggestion of any broken nose or swollen cheeks that are often claimed for the 2D/3D representation (see 1:19:09).At the end of the programme Ray Downing takes a photocopy of a 3D plastic model of his face, to see if he can reproduce an image similar to that of the Shroud. He produces a very narrow oval of the very front of the face (1:24:17), with no representation of the jawline of the cheeks or hair, but claims that his scan and the Shroud (1:24:19), “exactly match.” They don’t, of course. The features are in the correct spatial alignment, but the fall-off in image as it recedes from the nose is huge in his model, and almost non-existent in the Shroud. This is why the Shroud looks so much more as if it has been made from a bas relief than from a full 3D head. Hardly surprisingly, his scan could easily be extruded into a 3D face (1:24:57 – 1:25:05), as it came from a 3D face in the first place, rather like the contoured face I have occasionally posted here myself. The Shroud, as we have seen only too often, doesn’t do this at all. I think Ray Downing has produced a good digital image, which no doubt could be made to walk about a CGI film very realistically, but I’m afraid that to claim it is any better or more accurate a representation of the man in the Shroud than has been created by numbers of sculptors just by looking at it, is unjustified.","date":"September 26, 2015 at 1:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/26/the-vp8-cinderella-question/","cat":"3d","title":"The VP8 Cinderella Question"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Strange.

So, as you say, the warp threads are prominent (at least on the front of the cloth, and in the pictures). I’m not sure it matters, but I’d like to clear it up. I can’t be sure from the Shroud Scope photos.Whatever the answer, there are corollaries I hadn’t thought of. If the markings are most prominent on the most prominent threads, then of course the back of the cloth, where most of those threads are hidden, would show very little discolouration. It would be interesting to see a bit of 3-1 twill woven entirely from black warp and white weft. Presumably it would be pretty dark grey on the one side, and pretty light grey on the other.The other observation, which I made before, is that any patch of Shroud Scope photo, image, non-image or blood actually shows dark diagonal lines best, which are not marked threads at all, but the shadows between them.

Anybody, artist or not, with a finger dabbed in powder paint, can produce an image with no medium, no light source and no outline in a very short time, especially if they are thinking of producing something resembling a contact print of a cloth laid on a body. The fact that my version looks nothing like the Shroud is nothing to do with the technique, but simply with my ability to visualise and represent the figure I’m attempting to image. Dame Isobel goes on to announce that there is absolutely no ’emulsion’ on the Shroud. She may well be correct. This is presumably derived from the STuRP findings that the image is entirely due to degradation of the fibres, and is, of course, in direct contradiction of Rogers’s thin layer of impurities.2) Next, she lists in detail the knowledge and skills an artist must have mastered “inside and out” in order to produce a good image: anatomy, perspective, foreshortening, paint chemistry, mathematics and geometry. However, unless she had a phenomenal childhood, this simply isn’t true, as her own remarkable work at the age of 14 illustrates very well. The skills of observation, imagination and reproduction are paramount, and although they can no doubt be studied and mastered, any number of child prodigies demonstrate that they may be acquired almost innately.3) From the foregoing list, Dame Isobel particularly concentrates on foreshortening, and makes the remarkable statement that the Shroud shows ‘strong’ foreshortening. I suppose the veracity of this depends on one’s definition of ‘strong’. To me, Mantegna’s “Lamentation Over The Dead Christ” and Dali’s “Christ of St John of the Cross” show strong foreshortening. The Shroud’s foreshortening, if any, is very weak compared to those, and could be produced entirely by observation, not by mathematical knowledge. Furthermore, the whole concept of foreshortening depends on angles between an object and an observer. If there is any foreshortening at all, this is evidence in favour of an artist, not against one.4) Then we move on to the catacombs, and Dame Isobel’s assertion that the portraits of Christ with a beard that we find in them must derive from personal knowledge of what he looked looked like. However her statement that some of the paintings derive from the 1st century is highly questionable, and she conveniently forgets that most of the paintings show Christ entirely differently. I agree with her that even if the Shroud is authentic, early portraits in Rome cannot derive from it, but her idea that any of them can be assumed to reflect personal knowledge of Jesus is unjustified.5) A couple of Dame Piczek’s later illustrations are not clear to me. An image said to be made of very diluted iron oxide with minimal binder actually looks like a piece of stained glass, with the lead borders clearly visible, and a variety of different colours, none of which looks like iron oxide. Is this in fact the correct illustration? 6) Now this I don’t understand at all. “It is always the paint particles which are inside [the] agglomerate, and the outside is the paint emulsion, while McCrone for instance claimed that he found inside of paint particles some kind of gooey yellow material.” Even Russ tails away in his attempt to make any sense of it. “What you’re saying here is that […] if it was paint you would have the actual pigment particles surrounded by the emulsion […] and not the opposite, and … and … OK, so …” Even he can see that this makes no sense, and is not, of course, what McCrone claimed.7) Then we have the extraordinary idea that early descriptions of artistic methods, such as those of Cennini (and Pliny, interestingly), cannot be relied upon as accurate guides as their language is too archaic to be understood. Actually I don’t think that Cennini has a lot to say about a specific technique which might produce the Shroud, although I’m sure Charles Freeman would disagree, but the implication is that, if a modern artist were to produce a good replica of the Shroud using a technique described by a 13th or 14th century writer, it would not be valid as he would probably have misinterpreted the writer. That’s special pleading of quite a high order in my opinion. Incidentally, McCrone’s single mention of Cennini in ‘Judgement Day for the Shroud of Turin’ is as follows: “Both red pigments (red ochre and vermillion), the paint medium (collagen tempera), and faint monochrome images were popular with artists during the Middle Ages (Cennini 1437, Eastlake 1847).” Dame Isobel’s arbitrary dismissal of McCrone and others: “They don’t even understand what Cennini and Eastland were referring to” is mere snobbery. Eastland wrote in English but mostly gives his sources in their original, so that his translations can be confirmed if necessary.8) Dame Isobel’s next point is that monochrome paintings of the kind illustrated by McCrone, such as those of Simone Martini in the Palais des Papes in Avignon, were only ever preparatory sketches for frescoes which would normally be laid over the top. In this McCrone does seem to have conflated some of the various monochrome styles of painting, from different times and different countries, described by Eastlake, but the fact that such a style of painting occurred at all, means that it was available as a means of creating the Shroud image.","date":"July 26, 2015 at 8:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/26/1999-interview-with-isabel-piczek/","cat":"image_theory","title":"1999 Interview with Isabel Piczek"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"What nonsense.

He sends it to a pathologist! We only had one choice: asking the experts!Indeed not we alone, but all physicians and pathologists consulted by us and the international media were deceived: Prof. Cyril Wecht, Former President of the US Academy for Forensic Sciences, Home Office Pathologist Prof. Christopher Milroy of the University of Sheffield; Prof. Mihatsch, University of Basle/Switzerland; Prof. Dr. Carsten Nygren, Oslo; Prof. Dr. Pierluigi Baima Bollone, University of Turin; Prof. Jean Pierre, University of Paris, as well as a dozen pathologists shown the film by my colleague Luc Bürgin, a whole auditorium of Mexican physicians and professors of the University of Cluj/Romania, to which I showed the film, all believed the film showed a real corpse, not a dummy. The German dermatologist Dr. T. Jansen even wrote an article for the “Munich Medical Weekly”, claiming that the film shows a (human) girl suffering from Progeria. More than one critic claimed that Santilli exploited the corpse of a girl deceased from a genetic disorder out of sheer greed. ). If I am guilty of anything, than it is trusting in leading representatives of the medical profession. But who was more competent to judge an alien autopsy than a professional forensic pathologist?”From ‘Statement by Michael Hesemann, author of “Beyond Roswell”.’ (http://www.outtahear.com/beyond_updates/Alien%20Autopsy%20Proved%20Fake/STATEMENT%20BY%20MICHAEL%20HESEMANN.htm)Daveb’s reliance on various pathologists convictions that the photos they were looking at were of real people is not unreasonable, any more than those UFOlogists who concluded that the Roswell autopsy was genuine on the basis of professional forensic pathologistical concurrence. However, I do not think that any of the Shroud researchers would have said, if asked, that it could not possibly be a painting. What they all said was that it was sufficiently accurate to represent a real body. In his ‘Autopsy Report’ for example, Dr Robert Bucklin does not discuss the possibility that it might not be at all. We have already discussed at some length that Dr Fred Zugibe thought that Dr Pierre Barbet’s anatomy was seriously deficient, and mentioned that Dr Norman Lee thought that the evidence clearly showed that the man had been buried alive, or that Dr Michael Baden didn’t think that the Shroud could have covered a real body. None of these people, except possibly Baden, were particularly concerned about whether the images they were shown could have been artificially made, but prepared to treat the image from the start as if it were genuine, and work from there. Anatomical deficiencies, which many of them noticed, were not therefore considered as evidence of artificiality, but were carefully explained from a forensic viewpoint, so the arms were dislocated, or the man was angled this way or that because of rigor mortis, or he was laid on a pillow of some kind, or he had Marfan’s syndrome. Curiously, the few forensic pathologists who have examined the shroud in intimate detail, Drs Eugenia Rizzati, Emilio Mari and Giovanni Judica-Cordiglia, do not appear to have considered the anatomy of the image at all.I do not want to get into a “my pathologist is better than your pathologist” squabble, and i agree with daveb that in general they treat the Shroud as if it was a photograph of a dead body, but I do not think that that means that it could not be an artifact.As for the rest of the comment above, daveb treats my remarks as if they were replies to quite different questions, rather than comments on Dame Isobel Piczek’s video. She does not mention pathologists at all. She does say that it is impossible to produce a portrait without binder, light direction or outline, and she is wrong. She does say that there is no covering on the Shroud, which conflicts with Rogers’s impurity layer. She does say that no such painting could be produced without mastery of a number of disciplines, all of which she appears to have managed herself by the age of 14. She does say that the Shroud shows ‘strong’ foreshortening, when it doesn’t, and so on.All this challenging to do this or that like a game show is contrary to any kind of objective study. Do I prove that the Shroud is a fake because nobody can produce a similar one made by a dead body? Does the uniqueness of an artefact prove a supernatural origin? Of course not.As for what I claim or do not claim, well, for a start it hardly matters, but for what it’s worth, I am currently swayed towards some kind of artificial creation, more probably by imprinting than the use of a paintbrush specifically, and inclined to the view that much of the original material has been deliberately removed, leaving degraded fibres, not unlike the manner described by Guarlaschelli. If this sounds like fanatical anti-authenticity then I’d love to hear a description of Joe Nickell’s views.","date":"July 27, 2015 at 4:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/26/1999-interview-with-isabel-piczek/","cat":"image_theory","title":"1999 Interview with Isabel Piczek"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thank you, Stan, for your optical expertise.

It relies on a degree of pareidolia to which Allan Whanger could only aspire in his wildest dreams, entirely based on some extremely blurred versions of the Enrie negatives which are claimed to be  “very high resolution scans.” The word “restitution,” and a possible way in which two similar images can be combined to extract information not obtainable from either individually is described, but not, in fact demonstrated, so that the various lines delineating the objects discovered on the body are not actually apparent in what we are shown. If there is any truth in these discoveries, a much clearer demonstration of how they were achieved will be necessary.Some researchers will be happy to accept all the pareidolia at face value, but we are next boldly informed that the body was lying face down on the Shroud, which will surely be a surprise to almost everybody. The justification for this is: “The position of the hair, the hollows of the face between the cheeks and mouth, the slope of the cloth from the right leg towards the left due to gravity, the position of the arms and wrists on a single plane and other details indicate that the force of gravity was towards the front of the body.” I don’t accept any of that at all, and could easily demonstrate the reverse.The rest of the video attempts to show that Jesus was buried wearing various garments and adorned with religious ornaments, which, during the course of the image-forming process, moved, producing successions of images of the same objects on the Shroud, rather like stroboscopic photos of objects in motion. None of the objects discovered by Allan Whanger and other pareidolists (flowers, titulus, crowns of thorns, spear heads, scourges, death certificates etc.) are observed at all, although a leafy headdress of Sarcopoterium spinosum, and various belts, chains and buckles are described in detail.As a bit of a side line it is revealed that the Sudarium of Oviedo, rather than being folded in two and wrapped around the face, was in fact folded into eighty layers and placed under the brow, thus holding the face slightly off the plane of the cloth. This is highly disputable.There are some ingenious descriptions of how double images of the hands could have resulted in the image that we all observe, although the details, again, rely on pareidolia of a fairly extreme kind.The video ends with a poorly argued attempt to explain how parallel radiation can emerge from a point source.The “International Institute for Advanced Studies of Spacial Representation Sciences” appears to be a one-man-band consisting exclusively of Giuseppe Maria Catalano.

I find it interesting that although Rogers went to huge lengths to bombard fibres with nuclear particles, it apparently did not occur to him simply to shine a heat lamp on any. What’s more, his two shroud fibres (what a pity he couldn’t focus better on the non-image fibre!) look very like the Holland cloth fibre, from the 16th century, perhaps supporting a medieval provenance, and nothing at all like the 4000-year old Egyptian fibre. They don’t even appear to be ‘half-way’ between the 4000-year old fibre and the 500-year old fibre, which they might if they were 2000 years old.There are many good reasons for rejecting radiation of various sorts, most of them specific to particular types of radiation, but I don’t think Rogers’s findings will contribute a great deal to the subject without a bit more systematic investigation.","date":"July 16, 2015 at 8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think it’s a pity when any researcher with a new idea begins by laying his authenticist, or non-authenticist cards on the table too forcefully.

In “Judgement Day for the Shroud of Turin”, Walter McCrone devotes an entire book to his observation of iron oxide particles in sufficient quantities to account for the image on the Shroud without the need for any vapours, radiation or even cellulose decomposition. He also observes vermillion particles and the remains of the collogen binder. Rogers, and STuRP generally, utterly denied that any of these observations were accurate. However, in a single sentence, McCrone mentions various minor impurities he also found: “silk, wool, linen and cotton fibres of various colours, wax spatters, bird feather fibres, rodent hairs, mica, limestone (calcite), quartz, aragonite, starch grains (corn and wheat), pollen (average less than 2-3 pollen grains per tape), mold sores, trichomes (leaf hairs), flyash (oil soot, power plant, incinerator, trash burning), Jeweler’s rouge, paper fibres, pigments (madder, orpiment, yellow ochre, azurite), paint fragments (titanium white, ultramarine, yellow ochre), plant and insect parts, charred linen fibres, etc.” From this list, Roger’s seized upon two words as substantiation of his idea that the entire shroud was coated in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities.In “A Chemical Investigation into the Shroud of Turin”, Heller and Adler list the tests they carried out on a wide range of fibres in order to determine any extraneous material. They report their tests in three groups: ‘proteins and heme derivatives’, ‘metallic species’, and ‘organic species and functional groups’. This last included tests for phenols, riboflavin, steroids, indoles, lignin (allyls), starch, porphyrins, pyroles, creatinine, uric acid, urea derivatives, primary amines, nitro derivatives, aldehydes, cellulosic carboxyl and Saponaria extrract. “With the exception of positive aldehyde and cellulosic carboxyl tests, all other species tested for tested negatively.” Rogers conveniently decided to ignore these negative results, particularly those for starch, Saponaria or urea derivatives, although he devotes an entire paragraph in “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin” to the negative lignin test, which he accepts.However, I was wrong in my remembering diimide as a protein rather than a carbohydrate removing agent. The point I wanted to make was that Heller and Adler noted that the darker the image, the more corroded the fibril carrying it appeared. They classified their samples into various groups, of which the following descriptions are relevant:– Pale yellow fibrils (non-image areas) – Surfaces appear slightly corroded under phase contrast.– Yellow fibrils (body image (non-blood) areas – Surfaces appear corroded under phase contrast.– Dark fibrils (Scorch areas) – Surfaces appear very corroded under phase contrast.In addition to this they report that after removing any protein from the blood areas with a proteolytic enzyme, the fibrils beneath looked like non-image fibrils. None of this concurs with Rogers’s view that the entire image resides on a thin layer of impurities, beneath which the Shroud material itself is unaffected.“I think it’s you who selects just what comforts your point of view!” In this respect I don’t have a particular point of view. All I want to do here is to point out the inconsistencies between various scientist’s observations. Maybe Rogers is right and Adler is wrong, or maybe it’s the other way round. Maybe McCrone was right all along. However, hagiographic acceptance of any one of them above the others is not currently justified.","date":"July 19, 2015 at 3:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“He came out and tried hard to make believe the color on the Shroud was precisely located there (in the primary cell wall instead of just Inside the impurity layer)!!!” No, you see this is a misrepresentation of the development of Fanti’s ideas. He does not consider the impurity layer as relevant, and why should he when there is so little evidence for it, but was attempting to account for the corroded discolouration observed on the surface of the fibres by Heller and Adler, but which is ignored by Rogers. In particular, it was his observation (which may have been mistaken) of evidence of discolouration on both sides of the Shroud that led him to explore the development of an idea first proposed in 1984. You have also clearly not read di Lazzaro’s explanation of how he came to explore his UV laser ideas.And you are being over selective about your criticism. Of course there are lots of things wrong with di Lazzaro’s hypotheses; neither I nor he deny that; but there are also lots of things wrong with Rogers’s ideas as well, and they are very similar, namely that Rogers has nothing to say about how an appropriate amount of ammonia can be emitted from a recently dead body, just as di Lazzaro (or Fanti) does not explain how an appropriate amount of radiation can be emitted.In short, a number of possible image formation hypotheses have been suggested by a number of researchers, and none of them are sufficiently comprehensive or sufficiently well demonstrated to be considered definitive. As such, it would be unwise to reject any of them, or at least their priniciples, although no doubt different commenters will have their personal preferences.","date":"July 19, 2015 at 7:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I remember all your papers well, Yannick.

Paolo di Lazzaro’s laser discolouration of linen fibres exactly replicates the colour and depth of penetration observed on the Shroud, and that is all he claims, not that his way is the only possible way, or that there is any known way in which an exploding body can produce such radiation. Similarly, Rogers has no qualitative explanation of how a recently dead body can produce any of the vapours he thinks responsible for the discolouration of his starch layer.You praise Roger’s for gradually developing his ideas regarding image formation, and condemn others for starting with pre-conceived ideas, but I think this is unjustified and unfair, and part of the cult of Rogers-worship that typifies most of your posts.

In “Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge” he specifically addresses Rogers’s observations of fibres irradiated with various things as illustrated in “The Shroud of Turin: Radiation Effects, Aging and Image Formation”, and shows that mild coronal discharge does not cause the defects that Rogers thought it must.It is interesting that although Fanti profoundly disagreed with Rogers on almost everything, he explained his reasons for disagreement courteously and in detail, and concluded: “Many thanks to the late Raymond Rogers who by means of hundreds of e-mails exchanged with G. Fanti made it possible to study and compare in depth the CD effects on linen fibers with those of the TS and who was so kind as to give to G.

It may be true that he based all his hypotheses about image formation on his carbohydrate layer, which he claimed would have reacted just as well as the cellulose of the linen itself, and could therefore be missed, but he ignored the descriptions of the ‘corroded’ fibres, which is in direct contradiction of the impurity layer hypothesis. Although the impurity layer formed the bedrock for his hypotheses, his actual evidence for its existence is vanishingly small and highly disputed. In claiming: “We expected to find starch on the Shroud, so we did not specifically look for it. That wasan unfortunate oversight” Rogers is simply wrong. Starch was specifically looked for, and was not found.There is no doubt that Rogers was a competent, thorough and much respected scientist, and in many ways I applaud Yannick’s unswerving devotion to him; but objectively, his observations and his conclusions must be judged in the context of the findings of the other STuRP scientists, who neither observed nor concluded the same.","date":"July 20, 2015 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“I’m not an expert at all and I don’t know if Heller and Adler did run all their tests on both image and non-image fibers.” If you had read their paper a little more carefully, you would know that they did.

The ‘electromagnetic radiation’ is made up of ‘light and gamma rays from cosmic radiation’ according to his description of the Egyptian fibre. It is this that makes up the major part of the overall deterioration of the fibres. In any cloth that has spent much of its life shut away from the light, the gamma rays from cosmic radiation play a bigger part than light.","date":"July 16, 2015 at 12:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi Stan.

Your paper, if I understand it correctly, attempts to demonstrate that the Shroud influenced art, by means of two specific “dramatic” changes – the 13th century “dramatical increase” in depictions of Crown of Thorns,, and the 12th-14th century “dramatic change” in the number of nails. However, David Mo pointed out that these changes were already beginning in the 11th century, and you agreed, now suggesting that the “dramatic change” began then, when “noble Latin guests” visited the Imperial Court in Constantinople during the Crusades. The dramatic change now takes over 300 years, which weakens the force of the word “dramatic,” don’t you think? There was quite clearly, by your own admission and by the evidence of your own paper, no “sudden manifestation” of anything. The 1239 purchase of the Crown of Thorns did not inspire a dramatic change, it was in the middle of a very gradual change. The appearance of the Shroud in Lirey in 1350 or so came towards the end of this change.Similarly, I can’t follow your argument regarding the number of nails. Firstly you claimed a 12th to 14th century change from 4 to 3, based on the Shroud, but claimed that Byzantine crucifixes ignored the Shroud in favour of Queen Helena’s discovery of 4 nails. When I said that this was as well known to the West as to the East, you now say nobody knew how many nails were discovered after all!It all narrows down to your claim that Western crucifix makers in 1150 knew more about the appearance of the Shroud than Byzantine crucifix makers. I simply don’t accept this, and would need considerably more evidence than the visits of a few Roman nobles during the Crusades to convince me it was true.","date":"November 21, 2014 at 4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/16/a-scorch-is-a-scorch-of-course-of-course/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A scorch is a scorch, of course, of course,"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"When it first appeared I was impressed by OK’s paper, and guess that his criterion for selecting the crucifixes (the wikipedia list) was as likely to be uninfluenced by bias regarding the number of nails, position of foot and so on as any other.However, I understood the point of his research was to show that the appearance of the Shroud ignited a transformation in depictions of the crucifixion, from four to three nails, adding the crown of thorns and so on. Having accepted that this transformation was not sudden, one is at a loss to try to pinpoint when the Shroud began to have this effect. Clearly not its appearance at Lirey, as the transformation had begun two hundred years before. If Robert de Clari’s observation in 1204 identifies the Shroud in Constantinople, that’s still a hundred years after the great transformation began. The putative arrival of the Shroud in Constantinople in 944 would be a possible start date, but how strange then that Byzantine crucifixion iconography into the midst of which the Shroud had suddenly appeared, showed no indication  of its existence (such that it is excluded from OK’s examination), while Western European sculptors recognised it immediately. This is all rather inconsistent. I don’t accept that the Shroud was somehow hidden from the Byzantines but exposed to tourists from Europe, nor that the four nails of Helena had anything to do with it, as they were as well known to Western Christianity as to Eastern.I also mentioned in an earlier response to OK that I was not convinced by his explanation for the wrong foot being atop. The Shroud clearly shows a wound in the right side and a left foot atop. Artists could either follow this (assuming, as we do, that the Shroud was a mirror inversion), or reverse it (assuming that the Shroud was a straight painting), but in fact the crucifixions said to be derived from it show the wound in the right side but the right foot atop.  To reverse one but not the other, on the basis of convoluted biblical interpretation, is pushing credibility, I feel. A similar argument to the one above applies to the Crown of Thorns. Unless a truly dramatic change in depictions occurred suddenly after 1239, it’s purchase by Louis cannot be said to have had anything more than a ‘booster’ effect on something that had been slowly changing for years. As such, it makes more sense to claim that the Crown of Thorns (or the Shroud) were products of the artistic development, rather than that the artistic development was derived from the relics.","date":"November 20, 2014 at 6:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/16/a-scorch-is-a-scorch-of-course-of-course/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A scorch is a scorch, of course, of course,"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Me!

The dismissal of the protocol and the selection of the site was nothing to do with them. When the results were collected, “the spread of the measurements for Sample 1 [was] somewhat greater than would be expected from the errors quoted.” Now the statisticians took over, and there has been erudite but inconclusive disagreement of the “my statistician is better than your statistician” type ever since. The Nature authors submitted their calculations to Prof. Bray of the Istituto di Metrologia in Turin, and Remi van Haelst submitted his to Dr Leese of the British Museum and Prof. Jouvenoux of the University of Marseille-Aix. Then Riani and Atkinson carried out their analysis establishing the statistical likeliness of a chronological gradient. But what does all this mean? All the results came out between 1200 and 1400, during the last 50 years of which the Shroud is known to have been in existence. That in itself is sufficient, as all the statisticians well know, totally to rule out a 1st century date (based on the radiocarbon data alone). It is interesting what while several papers have been written saying that the 95% confidence range is wrong, none have suggested a value that might be correct, based on the statistiics at hand. It would not include the first thousand years AD. Prof di Lazzaro is well aware of that and so is careful not to commit himself to a denial.“— Can they challenge the demonstration that the image has nothing to do with scorch?”The definition of a scorch changes almost daily on this blog, but ultimately comes down to a decomposition of the linen with concomitant discolouration. di Lazzaro sensibly thinks that draping a cloth over a full-size heated statue and removing it again may take too long for merely superficial effects to appear uniformly. The critical factors seem to be the intensity of the ‘heat’ and the duration of its application. Essentially all his experiments are, in fact, attempts to scorch cloth in such a way as to reproduce the discolouration and superficiality of the Shroud image. “— What can they say about the Maillard effect, which even Ray Rogers felt was just a hypothesis, and which I challenged?”I don’t think they say anything about the Maillard effect at the moment. It needs considerably more verification before there is anything to be debated.“— Can they show where paint comes into the picture?”Yes and no. If paint or pigment was originally involved, there certainly seems to be very little of it left. McCrone’s iron oxide, and various more scattered particles, may or may not have anything to do with it.“— Can they write a paper about how dye was involved?”I myself have wondered if the chronological radiocarbon gradient might have been due to a dye applied to the Holland backing cloth to make it match the shroud, especially in the ‘missing corners’ area. I don’t think anyone has said much more, have they?“— Can they write a paper about how some kind of ink was used?”See entry under paint.“Lastly,they will have to write a paper, preferably a peer-reviewed one, taking on all the special characteristics in the image, as described in the interview.”No, they won’t. Di Lazzaro is a proper scientist, and rightly points out not only that his experiments do not show the “only” way of discolouring the cloth appropriately, but also that the energy involved in creating the entire double image is “out the realm of science. As scientists, we feel uncomfortable when dealing with a body emitting a hypothetical ultrashort burst of VUV radiation having a peak power and a fluence equivalent to the contemporary emission of, say, ten thousand excimer laser shots. A miracle would be necessary, which cannot fit into any current scientific  paradigm.” Di Lazzaro’s are interesting, but are nothing like the last word on the subject, as he himself would be the first to agree.","date":"March 19, 2015 at 12:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/17/a-shift-drift-in-colin-berrys-thinking/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Shift-Drift in Colin Berry’s Thinking?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi Louis,I think Paolo di Lazzaro’s interview is a model of restrained scientific observation, but I am at a loss to find a gauntlet.

I speculated that where the Raes and radiocarbon samples were taken from, the Holland cloth underneath would retain its white colour, which indeed is the case, as Rogers’s “Scientific Method Applied to the Shroud of Turin”, Figure 18, and “http://www.holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/1309358_orig.jpg” illustrate.

Here, about 30 % of this age range will be YOUNGER than the HISTORICAL age of 1355 AD.” This amounts to 1150 – 1440 AD, as I said above.I do not disagree with his analysis. I agree with him completely. On the radiocarbon data alone, the Shroud cannot date to the 1st century.","date":"March 19, 2015 at 5:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/17/a-shift-drift-in-colin-berrys-thinking/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Shift-Drift in Colin Berry’s Thinking?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m afraid I disagree.

What I am saying is that even if the laboratories had inadvertently tested three unrelated pieces of cloth, there is nothing in the results that can indicate that any of them date from before 1150 or after 1440. Actually I think that there is a contamination gradient, as demonstrated by Riani and Atkinson, and that the contamination produced an older date than the actual one, as demonstrated by Ray Schneider. Given that hypothesis, the radiocarbon data still suggest a date between 1150 and 1440, or in this case a little narrower. What I think would be useful would be for a statistician to start from the raw data, accept the hypothesis that the samples were chronologically contaminated, and work out what can be determined about the age. I think he will find that the limits of 95% probability are still 1150 to 1440, and that any date from before 1000AD can be wholly ruled out.Incidentally, this is the third time I have mentioned, in this blog posting, that a committed authenticist has clearly demonstrated that any contamination had the effect of making the Shroud appear older, not younger, than its actual age.

How often did they use spikes to fasten people to the crucifix? Were criminals required to carry a part of the cross the the execution site? Were all corpses wrapped in a cloth?”As far as I know there was very little that might have distinguished Jesus’s crucifixion from thousands of others. It does seem that crucifixion was a particularly popular Roman punishment in 1st century Israel, and, judging by the various descriptions of it (and two rather badly drawn pictures) that there was no universally standard way of doing it. No doubt, however, individual fortresses had conventions that they usually followed, and I suppose Jesus was crucified without any special attention. There is no reason to suppose that the flogging, the carrying of the patibulum to a fixed upright and the iron nails were anything other than normal. Even the crown of thorns (which may be a specific reference to his ‘crime’ of kingship) and the spear-thrust (saving the bother of breaking the legs of one already dead) may not have been unique, or even uncommon; we just don’t know.As for the shroud, the gospel of Mark says Joseph of Arimathea went out and bought a linen sheet, and Matthew says it was ‘new.’ This sounds ordinary enough, although the curious side-hem and the definitely more expensive herringbone weave suggest that the relic we have today (if genuine) may not have been quite run-of-the-mill – then again perhaps Joseph felt Jesus was worth a classier shroud than normal.I don’t know how many shrouds from the 1st century Middle East have been found, but I imagine that the preservation of any of them was quite unusual, as the decomposing contents would have made a mess of most of them quite quickly, I suppose. Some, I dare say, have been found unused, which itself would account for their being no images on them, and others may have been wrapped around mummified or dried remains. I imagine that the removal (and retention) of a shroud from a recently buried person would have been quite rare.As to there being “absolutely no indication of artistic meddling on the shroud,” a simple yes/no response isn’t really adequate. A number of possible pigments have been identified, but not in sufficient quantities to create an image, and the image itself is either the degraded fibres of the shroud itself, or, as most recently suggested, a layer of degraded carbohydrate coating the fibres, or at least some part of some of them. In spite of Thomas de Wesselow’s convincing treatment of the lack of technical, stylistic or cultural coherence with 14th century art, it is not impossible that the degradation was made artificially. Either a degrading process was applied directly (similar but not identical to rubbing a hot metal plate quickly across the surface, or irradiating the material with UV or some such), or some other process, now washed off or otherwise removed, had the side effect of degrading the carbohydrate and leaving the image behind.“Wouldn’t they have wanted recognition as a genius? Wasn’t Christianity already a major religion? What was the motivation?”Not necessarily, Yes it was, and Money (in that order). Again with respect to de Wesselow, who shows how unnecessary it was to go to such trouble to fake a relic, such things were huge tourist attractions throughout the middle ages, and any church which had a good collection was guaranteed a steady income. It was in nobody’s interest to recognise the genius of the man who made them, as it would prove they were fakes!I’m glad you ‘butted in.’  Thinking it was obvious is the way many of us first became interested in the shroud, and finding it not as obvious as we first thought, became deeply entangled in the various threads of its uncertainties.

One problem with the supernatural is that it is well-nigh impossible to distinguish it from the unexplained. There are many, many aspects of the shroud which remain unexplained, but that does not necessarily make them good reasons for associating anything ‘supernatural’ with it. Another, equally difficult aspect of the supernatural is that, not being constrained by physics, as it were, it is capable of anything at all, and a guess that the image was formed by a burst of atomic radiation is as good as guessing that the entire shroud was created ex nihilo on the morning of the resurrection, while other associated grave-cloths simply dematerialised. Distinguishing which of the two is more likely is more of a philosophical than a scientific question.Another aspect of the inquiry is whether ‘supernaturalism’ might be expected to ‘rub off’ onto things associated with supernatural people (if so I might describe Jesus), in the way that forensics scientists claim that ‘every contact leaves a trace.’ This too is more of a philosophical than scientific question, but is worth exploring. A pair of Mahatma Gandhi’s sandals was recently auctioned near me, and fetched £19 000. They are worn and tatty, and had they belonged to anybody else would have been thrown away long ago, but they have a kind of ‘Gandhiness’ about them which makes them valuable. In that context, the very fact that the shroud is so venerated might be evidence that it has a ‘supernaturalness’ about it, that an ordinary cloth acquired from a supernatural person by association. Trouble is, of course, that in these cases provenance is all. If it were demonstrated suddenly that Gandhi had in fact never worn the sandals, or that the shroud of Turin was a 16th century copy, then the ‘Gandhiness’ of the one, and the ‘supernaturalness’ of the other, would disintegrate completely, suggesting that these qualities, even if they are genuine, lie in the minds of observers rather than in the objects themselves.","date":"July 20, 2013 at 5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/20/any-good-reasons-for-associating-anything-supernatural-with-the-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Any good reasons for associating anything supernatural with the shroud?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Surely the existence of creases in the Shroud is not in dispute.

Although early versions of the epitaphios are hard to come by, they seem to concentrate more on the cloth and the body than do the later ones, which tend to fill up with background figures of angels and apostles.As for Jesus ‘getting up and walking out,’ this is one of the few interpretations of the resurrection that requires that the stone be rolled away from the tomb.

There is no distinction in such a photo between the visiblity of the warp and weft threads. There is virtally no evidence of transverse bands (as opposed to individual threads) on the left hand side (where the ventral upper body image is), but several quite distinct ones on the right (where the ventral feet image is). The most prominent are two dark bands at the level of the hands. One of the lamps illuminating the cloth is immediately behind the image of the forehead, and shows two thin dark longitudinal stripes which can be traced to the middle of the cloth and possibly on down towards the feet.Three other interesting observations may be made of this photo. As so many of the stripes, both longitudinal and transverse, can be clearly seen from one side of the cloth to the other, we have prima facie evidence firstly that any repairs, invisible or otherwise, even in the area of the radiocarbon sample, do not constitute a significant proportion of the cloth. Secondly, the fact that the transverse stripes are so continuous even across the seam of the side-strip suggests to me, as it has to others, that the seam is not a joining of two pieces but a tuck in a single sheet; and thirdly, the darkness of the shroud compared to the lightness of the patches (almost the same colour in normal light) shows how dense and heavy the shroud weave is.","date":"August 27, 2014 at 12:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/27/banding-is-it-real/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Banding?

Here the various longitudinal stripes seem to me to be much thinner, where you can see them, and appear to be related to the ‘spines’ of the herringbone ribs, which may have formed into slight ridges or troughs as part of the rolling up process. I cannot find a good positive Enrie image, but the large scale negatives, which can be found at the link above among others, show a variety of bands, some very thin and some as thick as a width of a pitch. However they are much less consistent and the thick ones do not appear to be lighting artifacts as they sometimes extend over two or three bands of alternating pitch. It is not clear in any case that the pale vertical areas defning the sides of the cheeks, or the dark vertical areas defing the fall of the hair, are due to imperfections in the weave or the lighting of a photo rather than the shape of the image model itself.

I have, however, spent some time studying the alleged banding on iPad’s Shroiud 2.0. It is really most instructive. Take, for example, what appears in the Enrie negatives as a thin white stripe running vertically down the face, from the drop at the end of the epsilon bloodstain, through the eye, cutting off a chunk of moustache and just missing the lip. (A good place to see it in closeup is at http://www.artfinding.com/images/svv/2/325/cav_g._enrie_turin__il_santo_volto_le_saintsuaire-109-1.jpg). We might suppose that it is a single dark warp thread, running more or less the length of the Shroud. In Shroud 2.0, however, we see what it really is, namely a small group of three or four warp threads which have become bunched together during the weaving process, producing a tiny ridge of threads longitudinally down the Shroud (and a tiny trough the other side) which in turn casts an anomalous shadow. In other words, the bright distinctive stripe on the Enrie negative is simply an artifact of the weave, and not, in fact, a dark stripe at all.An inch or so further out is the sharp division between light and dark that appears responsible for the vertical cut off of the cheek, and forms one side of the area that Barrie Schwortz photoshopped upwards to remove the apparent ‘band.’ In Shroud 2.0 we can see that this line is the spine of one of the ‘herringbones’ and that these spines are often anomalies in the regular smoothness of the shroud, and although they appear as white stripes on the Enrie negative, they are artifacts of the light. In fact, the more we try to pin down what, precisely, makes the dark bands appear so, the more we find that the borders between the bands correspond with the herringbone ‘spines,’ and the more we wonder if the angle of the light wasn’t responsible rather more than any real discolouration.And, yes, sound waves can create ripples in all sorts of things, including fabrics, and no, nothing at all like the markings on the Shroud!","date":"August 27, 2014 at 5:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/27/banding-is-it-real/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Banding?

The question is, how important is this observation?To some, the overall shape of the face and the blocks of hair are the most obvious and recognisable features of the face on the Shroud, with the implication that if they do not appear on purported copies, then their identity can be denied. To others, an apparent ‘congruence’ of a number of minor features is more important, and suffiicent to establish identity, regardless of the shape of the face and hair.(To me, a man with a bushy moustache and beard, the droopy tapering spindles of moustache found on Byzantine portraits is quite sufficient to discredit them entirely. It is interesting how different people have different perceptions of what is significant and what less so.)To a few, the vertical stripes must be ‘explained away,’ as if would be copiers, recognising that the vertical stripes were artifacts of the cloth, permitted themselves to ignore the rectangular shape of the Shroud face and to draw a more conventional tapering jaw of their own without compromising the identity.So what are the pale vertical stripes separating cheeks from hair? Are they obstructions placed on either side of the face which prevented image formartion? Or could they be made of threads which were either paler than the others to start with, or prepared in such a way that they were less susceptible to the image-making process, whatever it was? And how can that be demonstrated?One way of establishing the existence of ‘banding’ is by examining Barrie Schwortz’s transmitted light photos, which conveniently eliminate the image completely. These are indeed clearly vertically and horizontally striped in light and dark stripes of varying width and intensity, although these variations are probably more closely related to the thickness of individual threads than their actual colour. The transverse ones clearly stretch right across the cloth, and the longitudinal ones can be traced for at least a metre or so. This cannot be seen on the Shroud itself at all. The apparent banding across the mid-part of face (hair-gap-cheek-gap-nose-gap-cheek-gap-hair, or dark-light-dark-light-dark-light-dark-light-dark) is not extended upwards or downwards. We should not be surprised at this, as there is no reason why the thickness of the threads (transmitted light banding) should be related to their colour (reflected light banding). There is the added consideration that the transmitted light was coming through the backing cloth as well, which must have added to the effect.I do not know how Robert Doumax achieved his effect. There must, I think, be a fair amount of subjectivity to it (just as in Schwortz’s abitrary patch lightening above), and would not able to consider its accuracy without applying it to other parts of the shroud, not just the face.Finally, as I have said before, one might predict that the irregular processing of the raw thread could lead to visible banding on a cloth, but in that case there would be irregular banding patterns longitudinally, as the warp threads would be made from separate individual hanks, and broad regular bands transversely, as each weft single hank was used up going backwards and forwards across the loom. This is not what we observe.","date":"August 27, 2014 at 7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/27/banding-is-it-real/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Banding?

I see from a long correspondence on shroud.com (lombatti.pdf), that some ‘experts’ deny the historicity of coins over the eyes on religious grounds, while others suggest they were there simply to keep the eyes closed. I would like someone to tell me whether a lepton (about 1 cm across) would have been enough to prevent the eyes opening, or not. They are very light, and I would have thought, useless for that purpose. When people were laid out in front rooms in England (perhaps they still are) copper pennies were used, which are about 3cm across  and quite substantial.I put ‘experts’ in inverted commas because I deeply mistrust ‘duel by experts’ as a debating tool. I don’t think any of the pathologists mentioned above took the shroud at anything other than face value. As a photograph, the eye area does indeed appear to bulge more than normal optical anatomy allows, so it was reasonable for them to conclude that there was something else present. Being ‘experts,’ of course, they were much too canny to make any historical suggestion as to what it might be.I think Yannick’s analysis is very reasonable here.I note that Don Lynn was ‘a true imagery expert’ and also ‘totally biased and misleading.’ without ‘a trained eye and brain.’ What is the unbiased bystander to make of that? What in fact is his field of expertise – can somebody, perhaps himself, answer for him? And what was the expertise of Rodante and Moroni, who were either ‘pioneering’ or ‘unimpressive’?Finally, what of our resident experts Max and Yannick?

However, the alphabetical series are full of gaps.Series 1 covered the back of the legs and is lettered AB to JB, but CB is missing.Series 2 covered the front of the legs and is lettered AF to CF, with a plain 2-F just to confuse things.Series 3 covers an area of Lirey holes (AF to EF) and also a midriff area of the back (AB to FB, with DB missing).Series 4 has an EB on the back of the neck, and a 4-F on a non-image area.Series 5 is missing altogether.Series 6 covers the chest, AF, BF and DF, but no CF.Series 7 & 8 are missing altogether, and Series 9 covers the top of the head, AF to CF.Perhaps somebody could explain this?It is usually stated that Max Frei also took some samples in 1973, which of course the STURP team were not involved with.

If the body, with side wound reopened and dripping with lots of blood, was laid gently, being held by a couple of people maybe under the arms and knees, on a flat sheet, would two neat little rivulets of blood trickle across the sheet from one side to the other, and then immediately dry so as not to get smudged? Or would the twin trickles flow from the chest wound across the back of the body itself, not dripping onto the sheet at all, and then dry so perfectly that they didn’t smudge at all when it was laid on the sheet?

If the Resurrection is explicable in scientific terms, then both it, and the image on the Shroud, and any relationship between the two, can be explored scientifically. If, however, the Resurrection is defined as an event outside of science, then obviously it is not accessible by scientific inquiry, and if the Shroud image is related to the Resurrection, neither is its formation. That being so, it is reasonable for a scientist, simply for the sake of the validity of his exploration, to adopt the first alternative. Such then, is the default position for almost all the scientists to have worked on the Shroud, even di Lazzaro and Giulio Fanti, who hope that some scientific source for their radiation/discharge hypotheses may eventually be found, and John Jackson, who seems vaguely to hope for some ‘new physics’ to come to the rescue of his collapse hypothesis.“Assume arguendo that the resurrection event was a transfer of the body into another dimension or universe. It would probably make sense than that the body traveled both up and down simultaneously AS WE WOULD PERCEIVE IT.” Now that’s not science at all. Why should anyone assume that Resurrection involves a transfer of the body into another dimension? But if one did, why would it “probably make sense than that the body travelled both up and down simultaneously”, even “as we would perceive it.”? It’s not impossible, but it’s not science, and as such, it doesn’t have to make sense. There is no need to pretend that it might. If I were compelled to say what a Resurrection miracle might ‘probably’ be, I would look towards those other examples of people raised from the dead by Jesus, namely Lazarus, Jairus’ daughter and the son of the widow of Nain.

If the crease is a ridge, the shading is reversed. This would occur in completely uncoloured cloth, and I believe most of the type 2 TIDS are of this kind. Intriguingly, the Shroud Scope “Durante 2002 Horizontal” image has the beard to the left of the eyes, while the “Face only” close up has it to the left. Because we seem to be attuned to think of light as generally coming from the top-left, the long crease running from the forehead, very close to the epsilon mark, through an eye and on down the length of the cloth, appears to be a ridge in the “Face only” version, but a valley in the bigger version. I wonder which it is.Other creases are possible. Sigmoid, or recumbent creases, are typified by a single large shadow if the ‘lip’ is facing away from the light source, or simply a bright leading edge if it is facing towards it.As I say, these shadow details are observable in otherwise completely unmarked cloth. However, I have some difficulty with them in the shroud. If the shadow was a result of light coming from above or below the camera, as it travelled the length of the shroud, then transverse creases should be almost impossible to see, which is not the case. If from the right or left, then longitudinal creases should be invisible – also not the case. And if from any of the other four points of the compass, then the herringbone weave of the shroud should be much better defined in the strips lying across the rays of light than in those lying parallel to it. Also not the case.All this being true, one is inclined to think that the visible colouration of TIDS may not be due to the light and shadow at all; in which case they would be visible even if the shroud were ironed completely flat. Many of the TIDS, especially the type 1s, seem to be of this type. They seem to have twin verges darker than the background, and pale middles, which seem to me to be about the same colour as the background. I’m inclined to postulate that these are sigmoid or recumbent folds, over which the image was made, leaving the hidden interior pale. Some of them have very sharply defined edges, which suggests some pressure, closing the fold quite tightly together, and others less so (such as the big one across the beard) where the image mechanism appears to have coloured the interior as well. Just as a test, I would expect one side of such a crease, which consists of two layers of cloth, to be darker than the other.The most interesting one is right through the middle of a bit of the foot bloodstain (dorsal image), which is wholly uncoloured, suggesting the the fold was firmly closed when the blood made contact with the cloth.Shroud Scope has a measuring device, which is not terribly accurate, varying according to the magnification of the image, but indicates that the widest of the ‘white valleys’ is less than 2mm, which means that the folds are less than 1mm apart, approximately equal to the thickness of the cloth, I guess.Fortuitously (you might have guessed) I have recently spent some time rolling up and unrolling 5 metre lengths of cloth, which were acting as scenery for a travelling theatre, and these kinds of creases, both transverse and longitudinal, are very easy to ‘iron in’ as it were, and quite difficult to get out again later. Any mention of the shroud before the 1532 fire generally assumes it to be folded rather than rolled, from Ian Wilson’s Mandylion Face, to the Lirey poker holes, to the marks from the 1532 fire, so I am guessing that these creases are from the original manufacture of the cloth, be it 1st or 13th century, although some of them could easily have been ironed in further by one or other pressing mechanism, such as a hot bas relief.","date":"February 3, 2013 at 7:43 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/could-this-be-clinching-evidence-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-contact-scorch/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Could this be clinching evidence that the Shroud image is a contact scorch?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"It may be, I think we can all agree, that Dan is deluding himself into denying the presence of coins over the eyes of the shroud image.

Your unsubstantiated opinion is not justified or explained. My opinion is explained in detail. The Catholic church has nothing to lose in determining whether the Shroud is authentic or not. Nor do individual Christians, unless their religion is determined more by a sheet of cloth than by the words and works of the founder of Christianity. Those who are convinced they know whether the Shroud is authentic or not will be delighted to be able to demonstrate that they were right all along, and those who are not convinced will be delighted that the truth has been discovered at last. I have no doubt that the Pontifical Academy of Sciences would agree. Their reluctance to permit further investigation is  not because they don’t want to know, but because of the difficulty of finding appropriate personnel to carry it out, to ensure that there was as little inherent bias as possible, which could either influence the results, or, even if the results were scrupulously scientific, be thought of as having influenced the results.Louis suggests that ecumenical conferences are not possible in certain countries, presumably where religious views of tolerance, generosity, compassion and magnanimity are less well developed as in the UK. He may be correct; I don’t see that it has any relevance.I do not believe this statement: “There was no “ecumenism” there because what was trampled upon was Christian belief and a relic that is considered to be a Christian relic. I do not stand alone in my judgement, I am the only one who is speaking openly.” Christian belief was not trampled upon. It was disagreed with, but in the most friendly and generous manner. Ecumenism (or, to give it a less specifically Christian focus, “religious pluralism”) is not an attempt to make people of different beliefs merge into a single tradition, but an attempt to show that it is possible to hold very different beliefs but still live in harmony. A Jew, a Hindu, and at least three different denominations of Christianity met in a tent with Ahmadiyya Moslems in just such a spirit at the Jalsa Salana, and there is no doubt whatever that God smiled on the occasion.","date":"September 19, 2015 at 8:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well; for the benefit of my readers.

What follows is not at all definitive, but might show in which direction I am currently pointing. Imagine three artists producing an image of Christ. Artist A simply paints a picture. Even though it is life sized, he does not pretend that it is anything more than a painting. He probably does not paint a nude image, but, as nudity is what he wants to represent, a loose wisp of cloth is unrealistically ‘flown’ across the appropriate place. Artist B want to produce a “miracle.” He too just paints a picture, and it looks just like Artist A’s picture, but he manages to persuade some gullible clerics that it was found in a Byzantine church, which is enough to begin to establish its credentials. A hundred years later its frame is so covered in ribbon and episcopal seals that its miraculous nature is assured. Artist C wants to produce something which is not a painting, nor a miracle, but a representation of what might have been left on a cloth if it had covered a dead body. Whether he does this pretending that it is the real thing, or a representation of what the real thing might have looked like for liturgical or educational purposes is not important. Possibly he deliberately wants to encapsulate the entire passion, from the bloody sweat to the final spear thrust, and including the “stripping of his garments” all in a single educational package which can be displayed above an altar. Does he get a friend, paste him up and spread a cloth? Maybe he does, and the resulting mess is wholly inadequate. By experimentation, using a variety of materials and techniques, possibly including flour, oil, myrrh, aloes – even real sweat – he achieves a satisfactory result.You don’t believe it? Why indeed? Why should anybody, but that’s not the point of my comment.

I’m not sure who “these researchers” are, but if they include me then I can assure you that they do not ignore facts, basic or not. However they may not feel that conclusions are as secure as others think they are, and will be happy to explain why.Firstly, any kind of contact mechanism, including but nor restricted to Colin’s flour coatings, could have the blood applied to the contacting material after the image-making medium had been applied, so that when the cloth was pressed to the ‘body’ naturally the blood will contact the cloth before the medium, quite possibly obscuring its effects.Secondly the observations upon which the conclusion that there is no image under the blood are not particularly conclusive. The observations are that when a variety of fibrils are tested with protease, not only is all protein effectively removed, but that “blood” and “non-image” fibres resemble each each other, but appear different from “image” fibres. The difference between “image” and “non-image” fibres is that the surfaces of the former appear “corroded” while the latter appear “slightly corroded.” This corrosion, according to Heller and Adler, is directly related to cellulosic decomposition related to image-formation.It should be noted that the observation that the colour of the cloth in image, non-image, and scorch fibres is directly related to the degradation of the linen fibrils is directly contradictory to Ray Rogers’s hypothesis that the Shroud was covered with some kind of coating, which, if it was removed, would leave undisturbed linen beneath.However, it must be remembered that while the blood stained every fibril of the area of cloth with which it made contact, the image stained only a very few fibres on the upper surfaces of the crowns of the threads. In other words the vast majority of the blood fibrils would have had no image underneath them, even if the image appeared on the cloth before the blood. Furthermore, it is apparent from Mark Evans’s micrographs that much of the blood has been abraded away, and that this abrasion has mostly been from the uppermost surfaces of the threads, removing both blood and any image that may have been beneath, and leaving on the surface only fibres originally beneath the image layer.If I have not made myself clear, I hope someone will ask for clarification.

Allow your eyes to let the two images merge into one, and there you go. It’s a clever effect, and only slightly marred by being completely inhuman. The moustache seem to jut bizarrely forward, the eyes are too deeply sunk, and the neck appears to have been carved away to nothing. The whole of the right side (the image’s right, that is) of the face below the cheek bone seems hollow as the man turns his head to the left (his left), and the beard seems to be hanging in space in front of the rest of the face.For this reason, surprisingly, I believe the ‘model’ upon which the familiar picture has been superimposed, has not been fiddled about with to make it more acceptable. However, I do understand that a ‘model’ has to be made. Simply taking the photo by itself results in all sorts of bizarre ridges and furrows created by the weave. These have to be smoothed out, to give a rather dull uniform grey computer ‘model’ (with extremely odd proportions) which can be artificially lit from various directions. The photo is then retrofitted back onto the model. That is why a relatively uniform surface , such as the cheeks, can be covered in such a wide range of greys, which if they really represent distance should cover it in pimples and pocks.The good old VP8 image analyzer photo shows what happens if you take the image ‘as is.’(Incidentally, what happened to that machine? Was it ever used for anything else?). The analyzer used an absolute scale of brightness (as, perhaps, did Soons), which had the effect of envisioning the shroud as completely horizontal above the ‘body’ which created the image, whereas later versions have assumed that the shroud was draped. This means that the grey scale has to be ‘interpreted,’ as areas which could have different contours on the body would show up with the same brightness on the shroud, and vice versa. Most of the interpretations I have seen of this are highly subjective, and my own view is that the ‘horizontal’ interpretation produces better 3D results.Perhaps also surprisingly to anybody who hasn’t tried it, but this effect is not peculiar to the shroud, nor does it prove that the shroud is not a painting or drawing. (Other things may prove that, but the 3D effect does not.) You need a picture of a person with ‘face on’ lighting against a black background. Photoshop and similar programs have a ‘bas relief’ filter and an ’emboss’ filter, which emulate the VP8 in slightly different ways. With a little parameter adjustment it is possible to get images at least as accurate as the shroud, and sometimes a good deal more so.","date":"November 18, 2012 at 3:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/18/i-certainly-have-real-reservations-about-petrus-soons-3d-work-any-comments-now/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I certainly have real reservations about Petrus Soons’ 3D work.

The side facing the weaving would be predominantly weft, and the back side would be predominently warp. However, I wasn’t really thinking: of course when the sheet was cut off the loom, it wouldn’t have a front or a back, and even if it did, there’s no reason to suppose which side might be the one in contact with the ‘body.’Now I see that the close-ups of the weave were taken when the shroud was horizontal, and that they show predominantly horizontal threads.

The child is partially obscured by the teddy he is carrying – we know that the teddy is in front of the child. And so on. Our familiarity with faces is such that any picture of a face, however crude, implies that the nose protrudes and the eyes are deeper set, and we tend to see that simply as a matter of cultural experience. This has to be extracted from the claim that the 3D information on the shroud is a result of a relationship between the darkness of the image and the vertical distance between a hypothetical body and a hypothetical sheet, which in the VP-8 and ImageJ is horizontal. Extracting the cultural bias is, however, extraordinarily difficult, and has led people looking at the VP-8 graphics as if they were a great deal more realistic than they actually are. A man’s cheeks and eyebrows are not in the same plane as his nose, (as appears in the Shroud and in the image above), but we unconsciously forgive the images that show them to be so because we know what they ‘ought’ to look like. To attempt to rectify this, here are a couple of images, the Shroud and one which really does have a darkness/distance relationship, tilted slowly sideways until we can see them in profile. It would be wrong to say that the Shroud has no such relationship at all, but it really isn’t very good, and certainly not evidence either of a miracle or of some kind of radiation attenuation from a real body-shaped body.","date":"August 12, 2015 at 5:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/it-is-really-really-time-to-rethink-what-we-think-about-3d/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It is really, really time to rethink what we think about 3D"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Claro que si!

After death, when there is no further renewal of the energy supply and when the integrity of cell membranes is lost, cell walls become freely permeable to potassium ions, and the concentration inside and outside cells tends to equilibrate.

I have been excoriated here once or twice for taking what seems a good coherent and rational experiment, and denying the unassailability of its conclusions by pointing out a contrary detail that negates them. The irritating 610nm spike on the reflectance spectrum of the blood, for instance, simply cannot be swept aside as irrelevant, however compelling the vast majority of blood identification tests have been.Something similar is true of the scorch hypothesis. In spite of OK’s protestations that Colin’s images are not identical to the shroud, a simple scorch demonstrates almost all the characteristics required of the shroud image. It’s 3D quality and “negative” affect are extremely similar, and there is no pigmentation other than degraded flax fibres. The STURP team regularly described the image as resembling a scorch. Which it does. Nevertheless, there are two inconvenient details which contra-indicate, and until they are resolved, the scorch hypothesis cannot be said to have been confirmed.Firstly, the shroud image does not penetrate the cloth. If I want to achieve this, I have to brush a very hot spatula very quickly over the surface of cloth. I have not managed to achieve it using a bas relief. Some interesting experiments have been carried out using different materials (china and brass), different substrates (cloth, wood and snow) different temperatures and different contact times, but every time, if I can see the image on one side, I can also see it on the other.The other problem is UV fluorescence. The whole of the shroud fluoresces slightly, but the image appears dark. Although this is easy to achieve if the scorch is dark enough to be described as “brown” it appears that most photographs of the shroud are deceptive, and that the image is best described as “yellow”. If however, I produce a yellow scorch (usually by reducing the temperature of the bas relief), then I find it fluoresces brightly.As I hope anyone who has read this far will see, I am as willing to recognise discrepancies with non-authenticity image-formation claims as I am for pro-authenticity claims.","date":"November 15, 2013 at 9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/its-a-negative-its-3d-yes-maybe-sort-of/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It’s a negative.

Superficially they’re excellent, but, as I have said, once one begins to probe the details, one is left with more and more difficulties that militate against authenticity (although heaven knows, they don’t necessarily support the forgery hypothesis either). For instance, the ranks of even the most determined authenticitists are split between the “washed” and the “unwashed” (referring to the body, of course, not the people!). Setting aside those who think the shroud is a forgery, or who don’t think the blood is blood at all, I believe that few people doubt that the scourging would have left the body drenched with blood, and that the rivulets of blood down the arms, at least, were made while the body hung on the cross. In order to produce those neat little dumbbells, the body would have had to be washed – but then, why not wash off the rivulets down the arms or on the brows? Or the body was not washed, in which case how did those delicate little patterns extrude themselves through the matted blood over the back? Various semi-scientists have tied themselves in knots attempting to account for this phenomenon, more or less unsuccessfully. They are clot retraction patterns, they are serum exudates, they are haemolytic derivatives and all sorts of odd variations, most of which can explain some aspects of the shroud bloodstains, but fail when applied to others.Here’s a simple experiment. Get a teat pipette of red liquid and attempt to replicate (or produce anything at all resembling) the blood belt, by some kind of natural flow. Most so-called observers have assumed that the blood flowed from the sides and pooled in the middle, when this is clearly not the case.

Collimated rays of light (or other wavelengths) hitting the cloth at an angle would necessarily cause ‘shadows,’ which would extend behind the hills in the opposite direction to the incident rays. Rays perpendicular to the cloth wouldn’t create shadows. If an appropriate analysis of, say, Mark Evans’s photos were made, increasing the contrast between ‘image’ and ‘background,’ it would indeed be possible to determine whether the rays hit the cloth orthogonally or not.Much of the discussion of this question comes from consideration of the lack of ‘sides’ to the image, and particularly the fact that there is no ‘Agamemnon mask’ appearance to the head, which must have occurred if the sheet were draped closely over the head. This has lead some people to suggest that whatever emanated from the body must have done so vertically, Others, suggesting that the sheet was roughly flat over the body, and held away from the sides either by bags of spices or by tension, are not in agreement whether the front of the face, in particular, shows distortion or not.It seems logical to assume that some parts of the body were actually in contact with the cloth, and others were not. Where there was contact, there would not, of course, be any directionality, and one might guess that all parts in contact with the body would be similarly marked. It is interesting that the images of the forehead, nose and cheeks are not, in fact, equally dark – one of the reasons the 3D imagery is so successful. The mechanism for image forming nevertheless seems the same for both contact and non-contact areas. Colin Berry thinks this is peculiar, and attributes all the image to contact, but at different pressure in different places, and he may be correct. In this case, the ‘Agamemnon mask’ effect is eliminated by using a bas relief rather than a full-depth body. John Jackson recognises a similar problem, but achieves his affect by imagining the cloth sinking through different thicknesses of an image-making aether before coming to rest on the stone surface of the tomb.If there is some non-contact image formed by rays of some kind, I suggest that a photomicrograph of the side of the nose would be a good place to look for ‘shadows.’","date":"April 21, 2013 at 6:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/21/john-klotz-new-quantum-christ-blog/","cat":"image_theory","title":"John Klotz’ new Quantum Christ Blog"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"There are a lot of practical difficulties about producing a scorch image by heating a six-foot long hot metal template, but that doesn’t mean the scorch theory is dead; far from it.

So far they have been unsuccessful. A panel commissioned by the United States National Research Council to study paranormal claims concluded that “despite a 130-year record of scientiﬁc research on such matters, our committee could ﬁnd no scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mental telepathy or ‘mind over matter’ exercises… Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist.”Well, they may all be wrong, and as we have heard elsewhere in this post, some ideas have eventually become accepted even after years of rejection, but it would clearly be wrong to suggest that parapsychology is in anyway mainstream science just yet.","date":"November 16, 2015 at 4:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/13/nevertheless-the-images-are-real-enough/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nevertheless, the images are real enough!"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No, I’m not.

I couldn’t be any more institutionally Christian without becoming a monk! (I could no doubt be a much nicer person, but that’s another facet altogether).However, one of the Catholic version of Christianity’s core beliefs in is the rationality of the Universe, and the conviction that Faith and Reason cannot conflict. This was first expressed explicitly by St Augustine of Hippo, reiterated by Thomas Aquinas confirmed most recently by John-Paul II and Benedict XV, and is the rationale behind the Pontifical Academy of Science. (Is there another religion in the world with a scientific institution so close to its heart?)The nature of the resurrection may, perhaps, be inexplicable. To deny that anything happened at all, which is the usual atheist line, is absurd, but all attempts to pin down exactly what it was have proved fruitless, and theology has moved on. The science of the physical resurrection, in other words, has stopped. Inexplicable – leave it and move on.That’s exactly why, as I explained above, I won’t be treating the shroud as inexplicable.Several of the commenters on this blog (including yourself, it seems) would like to have it both ways, and try to intertwine the rational and the irrational, the scientific and the mystic. They would like Jesus to have exploded in a burst of radiation, or dematerialised in an instant vacuum, or even simply ceased decomposing, woke up and yawned; and they would like this to have happened ‘miraculously,’ but without disturbing the laws of physics. This may be permissible within the bounds of individual conscience, but it is not Catholic orthodoxy or teaching.By now, I can feel some of you stuttering with rage and thinking that I have demoted the shroud to the relevance of one of Napoleon’s handkerchiefs. Nothing could be further than the truth. Although St Augustine said that Faith and Reason could never conflict, he famously said that Faith ‘precedes’ Reason. He didn’t altogether mean that if there was uncertainty about a question then Faith should be given the benefit of the doubt, but more that unless you believe something is worth the bother, there would be no point in trying to find out more about it in the first place.The shroud will continue to be important even if it is no more miraculous than any of the great masters’ paintings and sculptures of the life of Christ. It can be an object of personal contemplation, a means of education, a focus of unity among those drawn to its image. It inspires awe, immanence and compassion. Whether it is eventually completely explained rationally, or abandoned as an object of scientific study altogether, it will continue to influence people in one way or another for as long as it lasts.","date":"August 29, 2013 at 4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/26/nicely-done-you-must-download-this/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nicely Done: You must download this"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“an inexplicable explanation”Maybe my interpretation of ‘logical inconsistency’ is different from yours.

The first is the variation in pressure where the two surfaces (‘body’ and cloth) are in contact, and the second a much more diffuse convection effect where they are not. Dr Power quotes John Jackson’s list of intensity/distance correlations which, when graphed, clearly show a steep line over the first centimetre or two (which I would interpret as the ‘contact’ zone) and a much more flatter line between that distance and four or five centimetres (the ‘convection’ zone). In other words a very small difference in contact pressure would produce a large intensity variation, while quite a large difference in distance in non-contact zones has little effect on image intensity.The radiation hypothesis has to cope with a number of difficulties; the fact that it has to be vertically collimated, and the severe distance/intensity attenuation being the biggest. Also the fact that even between points of the same distance, at least as determined by Jackson, the intensity varies by a factor of two.And, yes, Thomas, scientist to the core though I be, I have never ruled out the ‘miracle’ hypothesis.

I would predict that each warp thread was made of its own hank, and therefore that vertical bands of different intensity would occur randomly across the image, giving irregular widths of lighter and darker areas. Each weft hank, on the other hand, would be woven across and back until it was used up, and a new hank attached to the shuttle. This would result in horizontal bands of approximately uniform width on the image. The intersection of these bands would produce a vaguely chequered effect, ranging from light (where two light bands intersect) through medium (one light, one dark), to dark (two dark bands), with endless graduations in between as the colour of each band varies anyway. This pattern should be seen all over the Shroud, even in non-image areas. If the image is related to the treatment of the cloth, then indeed light image areas could be less responsive to whatever caused the image, producing a less intense image, and dark areas more so, producing a more intense image. This would vindicate Rogers’s suggestion. The exact reverse of this could in theory be also the case!I’m in Kathmandu just at present and do not have ImageJ with me, but it would be instructive to take a vertical strip or two, perhaps one centimetre wide, of non-image, to see if it produced approximately evenly distributed variations in intensity (or height), and a horizontal image or two of non-image to see if it produced random variations.","date":"July 22, 2014 at 12:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

The physical properties of cellulose, as well as their chemical behaviour and reactivity, are strongly influenced by the arrangement of the cellulose molecules, with respect to each other and to the fibre axis as well.

To help with the explanation, I will say that the shroud is woven of threads, and each thread is made of twisted fibres. These are loose and can be pulled apart with a needle. Each fibre, in turn, is made of fibrils, packed around a hollow centre, the lumen, and surrounded by a sheath. It seems reasonably clear from Mark Evans’s micrographs that the image appears only on the uppermost fibres of the threads of the shroud, not on the fibres buried within the threads, and not on the fibres as they dive beneath other threads as part of the weave. It is not clear from Evans’s photos whether these coloured areas are as a result of the whole fibre being discoloured, just the sheath, just the fibrils, or what.Explaining the mechanism of image formation, whether by heat (subdivided into conduction and radiation), chemically (by gas diffusion or possibly direct contact), or some other kind of electromagnetic or nuclear radiation, must intimately involve the chemistry of the fibres, and those who study it are not in universal agreement, to put it mildly. Any kind of gas diffusion and most kinds of radiation seem to penetrate too deeply and too widely, and even conduction or contact must be fantastically discriminate to produce such an effect. I have shown that brushing the surface of linen with a hot spatula can do it, but am not aware of any other method that simple. Most experimenters have first done something to weaken the correct fibres appropriately, and then produced the surface discolouration by heating in an oven. Fanti and his friends have found that very intense, very short bursts of laser light can do the trick, while Garlaschelli has done it by dabbing cloth with a gel containing sulphuric acid. Rogers despaired of achieving it in the end, and postulated that the linen wasn’t degraded at all, but that the image appears only on a surface coating derived from an evaporation gradient.Whatever the truth of the process, understanding the relative sensitivities of the chemicals which make up the linen fibres, be they cellulose (crystalline or amorphous), lignin (with or without vanillin), hemicellulose, pectin or anything else, ought to be a great help.","date":"October 31, 2013 at 8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/28/of-those-big-meaning-words-superficial-half-tone-and-striated/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of those big-meaning words: Superficial, half-tone and striated"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I just meant those ones you get by putting “shroud” and “Mark Evans” on Google images.

The blood marks show an element distribution CONSISTENT WITH A BLOOD CLOT EXUDATE, including an iron value elevated over the cloth background value, but no evidence for the presence of mercury or any of the trace elements associated with the mineral forms of iron oxides.”The actual words of the report are:In the initial abstract – “In ‘blood’ stain regions the measurements show significantly higher concentrations of iron. However the data do not allow a unique identification of the stain’s origins.”In the Conclusion – “Substantially non-uniform concentrations of iron were observed, particularly at the dorsal-foot and side-wound ‘blood’ stain regions. However we can say no more than that either blood or some iron-based pigment was used to produce the stains.”Oh, and the word ‘mercury’ does not appear in the report at all.Secondly:“The reflectance spectra of the blood marks from the whole cloth and also a near UV-visible microspectrophotometric study of blood particles from the sticky tapes […] are CONSISTENT WITH THE SPECTRA EXPECTED FOR A TRAUMATIC BLOOD CLOT EXUDATE.” Need I remark that in none of the papers cited do the words “trauma”, “exudate” or “clot” appear at all, let alone an image of the “spectra expected” from one.“In a more recent study […], transmission UV-visible spectra of a simulacrum of a TRAUMATIC CLOT EXUDATE prepared from laboratory chemicals MATCHES THESE OBSERVED SHROUD SPECTRA, but the simulacrum of a mineral pigment “blood” composed of iron oxide, mercuric sulfide and gelatin IS A COMPLETE MISMATCH.” The spectra from which this nonsense is derived can be seen at http://www.sindone.info/ADLER.PDF.

How we’ve grown up since then!To more significant matters. Everything hinges on two questions: Did the man in the shroud have his legs bent?” and “Was the shroud over the top of the body horizontal or draped?” Without clear answers to both these questions, all the measurements and superimpositions are more or less meaningless. There are other related questions, but these are the important ones.Question 1.  The dorsal image shows clear impressions of the calves and thighs. As the simplest experiment will demonstrate, the slightest bending of the knees lifts the calves well clear of the floor. Prima facie, the man did not have his legs bent. Other possibilities – even under the body, the shroud followed its contours, perhaps by being laid on some sort of mattress, or, the image of the calves is not a contact image, but a collimated projection of both image and bloodstains downwards from the body.Question 2. If the shroud on the top of the body followed its contours, while the shroud on the floor remained flat, the top image would be longer than the bottom image. The more bent the knees, the more pronounced would be the discrepancy. Although there is room for manoeuvre here, if the two images are superimposed crown-of-head to crown-of-head, the rest of the features match up very well without any adjustment of the upper image length. Prima facie, the two images are the same length. Other possibilities – the two images also match up reasonably well if the lower image is stretched by 10cm or so, so it’s all a bit subjective.To answer Ron’s question: “How valid is this?” Not at all.","date":"June 23, 2013 at 10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/23/paper-chase-computerized-anthropometric-analysis-of-the-image/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase:  Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Image"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks Ron.

It was exposed to a projector lamp shining through a photographic negative, and turned shades of brown, with a clear positive image on one side.

Also, at the time I didn’t think about the fact that an evaporation concentration gradient might have concentrated the solution on the surfaces of the cloth. That may have contributed. Nathan Wilson claims that his image was superficial, without the use of any chemicals, although I have not seen any micrographs of his fibres.As the source of energy for most of the photograph experiments was the sun, it does not make a lot of sense to carry out an experiment with “the source of energy located in direct-contact with the cloth,” nor another one “located at 3 cm or so.”Nor do you need to have a cloth “covered with a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities,” unless you are wedded to Rogers’s impurity layer hypothesis, which is far from established.","date":"January 27, 2014 at 2:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/24/radiation-man-a-new-bsts-article/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Radiation Man:  A New BSTS Article"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Although I completely agree that all the characteristics of the Shroud image have to be accounted for before an explanation of its creation can be acceptable, it is remarkable that the photographic hypothesis is one of the few that does work “at the fibre level.” What’s more, and unlike most other demonstrations, this has been shown many times, by Nicholas Allen, Narthan Wilson, Picknett & Prince, and even myself (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n39part6.pdf).

However it is not impossible that, using Colin’s damp suppression method, something similar could be achieved using a bas relief.Of, course, using a bas relief or a heated spatula, then the distance of the cloth from the hot object is never more than a few millimetres, and the apparent “distance/intensity” is an illusion caused by the variation of contact pressure between the two surfaces. It would only be by using an actual body shape that the same observed phenomenon would describe an actual situation rather an apparent one.As soon as one postulates an image formed at a distance, one is immediately confronted with the twin problems of the direction in which the image forming agent dispersed, and the shape of the cloth over the body.

Other factors might be the preparation of the linen beforehand, as with Rogers’s putative starch or Saponaria layer (the ‘soapy custard’ hypothesis), and the length of time taken to develop the image, possibly including a ‘dormant’ period by which the cloth has become predisposed to discoloration, but only actually discolours after some trigger such as a chapel fire. Any or all of these or a combination of them, may have led to the result we have ended up with today.

Experiments using ammonia as the gas and dextrin (very similar to gum arabic, as it happens) as the sugar showed that a Maillard reaction between these two components does, in fact occur.But that’s as far as it went. There was no attempt to carry out the experiments using a big piece of cloth, a more realistic starch & saponaria preparation, or any chemicals actually associated with dead body. Attempts to explain the precision of the image are vague in the extreme.It is not impossible that some form of Maillard reaction was involved in the formation of the image, although, since Rogers and Arnoldi experimented using only ammonia, there is no suggestion that a dead body was an essential part of the image formation.

In this respect, the work of Ray Rogers demonstrates that the work of, among others, Giulio Fanti, is a waste of time, as they have been working on the linen itself.However, in spite of his extensive quoting, he does not notice the profound contradictions between, specifically, Heller & Adler and Rogers. Neither scientist identified Saponaria on the cloth, for example. Heller & Adler specifically tested for it and found no evidence for it, while Rogers’s only evidence at all was that it might be responsible for the weak background UV fluorescence observed by Miller and Pellicori. Nevertheless Rogers’s subsequent work was entirely predicated on the presence of Saponaria. Rogers also finds, and mentions several times, the presence of starch on the cloth, which Heller & Adler did not find at all, although they did test for it.Most curiously, Rogers says that in March 1981, when STURP met to discuss their findings, and Adler revealed that the image could be reduce by diimide, that these observations “strongly suggested that the cellulose was not involved in image formation.” However, in their subsequent paper published four months later, Heller & Adler write: “the image was produced by some dehydrative oxidative process of the cellulose structure of the linen.”Now without any prejudice for or against any of these scientists, their observations or their peer-reviewed or other publications, it must be seen that no definite conclusion can be made, so far, as to which of the competing hypotheses regarding the image producing substrate is correct.

If you expose a piece of photographic paper to a lamp in a dark room, you do not get a photo of the lamp, just a white blur, as rays from all over the lamp spread out and affect all over the paper. Even if you place a luminous mask on a piece of photographic paper in the dark, you do not get a photo of the mask, although a vague outline of its shape might be possible. This is because the light from all over the mask radiates in all directions. The peculiar circumstances mentioned above would be that if the rays of light from every point on the object all emerged and travelled in exactly the same direction, and if the intensity of the ray from each point diminished according to its distance from the cloth, then indeed, you might get a photo of a lamp or a luminous mask just be exposing it to a photosensitive sheet.

If he will allow me, I will make my own decisions as to how precious my time is and how best it can be put to use. Although pigment tends to be atomically dense, it is not established how much is needed to produce an image and whether such an image would necessarily be visible by transmitted light or X-rays. It is also not established whether an image could remain even if all the pigment was washed or flaked away. Neither the anatomical and medical ignorance of medieval artists, nor the anatomical and medical accuracy of the Shroud have been conclusively demonstrated, and until they are, a correlation betwen the two cannot be dismissed out of hand. So far, it is true, I do not think a satisfactory artistic or religious context for an artificial production has been found, but tantalising glimpses of medieval Christianity suggest that an attempt to discover one is not a waste of time.

It takes the form of a conversation, alternating between Joseph A. Kohlbeck, optical crystallographer, and Eugenia L. Nitowski, archaeologist, both with impeccable credentials.First. What, precisely, did Kohlbeck examine? In his own words:“Ray Rogers, asked me to take some quality photomicrographs and to microscopically examine some shroud fibers.” ” I began to focus on particles of calcium carbonate on the fiber samples.” “We then examined a calcium sample from the shroud taken from the area known as the “bloody foot” because this showed a larger concentration of calcium carbonate than other areas.” (Footnote: “Mylar tape sample JAB” – I think he means 1-AB, which was taken from the dribble of blood emanating sideways from the heel of the big footprint)This certainly sounds more than Villarreal’s speck. On the other hand there is no mention of the knee or nose.Second. What, precisely, did Kohlbeck find on the Shroud? In his own words:“This calcium carbonate turned out to be aragonite, not the more common calcite – and exhibited small amounts of strontium and iron.” (Footnote  – “Little could be done to examine the few small particles microscopically in the environment of the Mylar tape used to lift the sample because the tape had crystalline properties which interfered with obtaining optical information from the particles. Thus the risk was taken to recover these few crystals and remount them in a 1.680nD Cargille immersion oil. The intermediate or b [beta] index of aragonite is 1.680, and a match at specific orientations would be a good indication of the possibility of aragonite. In one orientation there was a match for the 1.680 index oil. An interference figure at 1250× having a small 2V angle estimated 18–20 optically negative was observed. These optical properties would be expected from aragonite and this is a strong suggestion that these fragments, particularly when compared with the Jerusalem samples, are aragonite.”)Meanwhile Nitowski was collecting samples from Jerusalem to be analysed as well. There is no mention of the number or whereabouts of the samples collected, except that they were “from inside tombs in the general vicinity of Jerusalem”. Kohlbeck says: “This particular limestone was primarily travertine aragonite deposited from springs, rather than the more common calcite.” “In addition to the aragonite, our Jerusalem samples also contained small quantities of iron and strontium but no lead.” A footnote says that the STuRP team did detect lead in the Shroud, but that Levi-Setti did not.They conclude this part of their article: “Of course, this doesn’t prove that the aragonite on the shroud came from Jerusalem, but this could be a reasonable explanation. Nevertheless, aragonite with these traces can no doubt be found elsewhere in the world as well as in Jerusalem.” A footnote hopes that further investigation will identify rare trace elements on both samples that will clearly distinguish them from aragonite samples elsewhere in the world. Then they go on to discuss blood specks also found on the fibres.I also have a copy of UV-Visible Reflectance and Fluorescence Spectra of the Shroud of Turin, by Roger and Marion Gilbert, and for good measure, Spectral Properties of the Shroud of Turin, by S.F.

There seem to have been at least two ‘geniune’ shrouds in Constantinople, and the famous mandylion and probably a couple of Veronicas as well. Adherents either tried to claim that theirs was the real one and all the others fakes or copies, or tried to reconcile the numerous versions by claiming that Christ was washed, wiped or covered with all of them either successively or together. Some were full body, some just faces; none, I think, showed a back view.

However, the specific reference in my comment above was about whether a paint layer of “one part per million” of iron oxide would be visible at all either by reflectance (just looking at it), transmission (Barrie’s backlight) or X-ray.

It is not perfectly clear to me exactly what this means, or whether it was necessary to paint several layers of this ‘paint’ on the cloth for an image to be visible, but as it stands, it is extremely doubtful if Barrie’s fairly simple and fairly small scale backlit photographs, or even the more detailed X-ray photos of Mottern et all, would have detected it.

I couldn’t agree more.Hypothesis One: The Shroud image could have been produced by the application of pigment, binder and medium, which at the time of application was visible as an image by virtue of the pigment, but which may now only be visible by virtue of the degradation of the substrate. This can be tested by various experiments involving different possible substances in different quantities upon different preparations of cloth. It cannot be refuted (definitely ruled out) except by demonstrating that it is impossible.Hypothesis Two. The Shroud image could have been produced by the decomposition of a human body within which it was wrapped, the products of which, chemical, electromagnetic, or nuclear reacted with the cloth in such a way that an image was formed. This can be tested by various experiments involving different possible emanations in different quantitiies upon different preparations of cloth. It cannot be refuted (definitely ruled out) except by demonstrating that it is impossible.In both these cases some emphasis should be placed on the word “possible.” A painting technique involving azo dyes could be considered impossible unless some evidence could be found to suggest that such compounds existed 500 years ago. A decomposition technique involving collimated radiation could be considered impossible unless some evidence could be found to suggest that such radiation can emerge from a body.Hypothesis Three. The Shroud image could have been produced by a miracle. This cannot be tested. It cannot be refuted. It is not a scientific hypothesis.The only thing I would add to Mario’s “It is very unlikely that it is a painting for all the reasons already mentioned,” is, as you will have guessed “It is very unlikely that it is a natural formation for all the reasons already mentioned.” The juxtaposition of these two statements weakens the term “very unlikely” somewhat.","date":"September 25, 2014 at 2:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Sorry, “10 parts per million,” of course.","date":"September 24, 2014 at 1:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I agree with all of that, Mario.

See Thibaut’s comment below, where he demonstrates that a 10ppm iron oxide/water mixture does not result in a visible image. That’s a real challenge to McCrone’s work. If your statement were correct, it would be equally true to say that unless at least one form of biological/physical formation were demonstrated it cannot be hypothesised that the Shroud formed naturally in a tomb. Which is of course untrue.However, it would not be sensible not to have some idea of how a painting might have come about. Another experiment currently underway but not yet completed involves a cloth bag containing a thick paste of iron oxide, water, egg white and sulphuric acid. This is dabbed vertically downwards onto a piece of linen. A very visible reddish disc of iron oxide is formed, denser in the middle than the outside, without edges or directionality, and which does not seep through to the other side of the cloth. The linen is left to dry, then washed thoroughly to try to remove everything. After redrying again, the idea is that we have nothing more than a sulphuric acid “scorch” to show where the “paint-bag” was pressed to the linen.So far, results have been poor. My iron oxide is so fine it comes through the cloth bag too readily, and the thick paste tends to dry up too quickly. The acid does not produce a visible “chemical scorch” unless the linen is placed in an oven, and even then the results are rather erratic. However, there are clearly many permutations to be tried, and I have hopes that something respectably supportive of the painting hypothesis will emerge eventually!","date":"September 24, 2014 at 5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The best overall coverage of the Shroud easily avaialble is Shroud 2.0, which is an app for iPad, and not downloadable onto computers, but you can take screen shots and send them across.","date":"September 30, 2014 at 2:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"There is no concentration of aragonite.

None of these is necessarily true. The density of the shroud is easily sufficient to prevent pigment soaking through, many watercolours are painting using ‘dabs’ of brush rather than any strokes, and an indication of light direction is not a necessary part of portrait painting, although frequently present. I wonder if some of the STuRP team – and their predecessors –  didn’t spend too much time researching pigments and binders and so on, and not enough actually looking at the process of painting. Charles is correct that there is virtually no mention of any priming of the material, for instance, which should surely have informed part of ther investigation.

Yes, Rogers was clear about a lot of things which are a lot less clear to others, and which he only partially substantiated.The ‘thin layer of impurities’ which only resides on the crowns of the fibres does provide a reasonable explanation of why vapours emanating from the body would only discolour the crowns of the fibres. However, Rogers’s attempt to achieve his ‘thin layer of impurities’ by means of an evaporation gradient has not been satisfactorily demonstrated, and the uniform source of adequate vapours from all parts of the body has neither been demonstrated nor satisfactorily explained. Rogers’s ‘thin layer of impurities’ contradicts the findings of other scientists, who didn’t observe starch, and who did observe corroded fibres. Rogers explanation that these only consisted of his ‘thin layer’ cracking off is naive.Rogers’s critique of coronal discharge consisted of carrying out his own experiments ad finding them unsatisfactory, which is fair enough. However, his experiments are not comparable to Giulio Fanti’s, and therefore his comparisons about colour and corrosion are not necessarily valid. I do note that he says: “Even a short exposure will erode the surface of flax fibers. No such changes can be observed on Shroud fibers.” In fact this was exactly what was observed by Heller and Adler.If a thin film of impurities is necessary, or a discolouration only of the crowns of the threads of the cloth, then some form of contact, whether by acidified paint, or wheat flour paste, or even a hot bas relief, is far more likely than evaporated dextrin.It may, after all, be that some of Rogers’s ideas turn out to be part of the explanation for the image on the Shroud, but there is a great deal more to be done before they can generally be accepted as confidently as Yannick supposes.","date":"July 23, 2015 at 12:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/the-morphing-of-rogers-and-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Morphing of Rogers and Berry?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Does the man in the shroud have his eyes closed at all?

Almost nothing of Dave’s video or his comments above shows any knowledge of either the Shroud or holography, and some of it is simply untrue. “I’m willing to hear more from Dave and anyone else,” says Dan. Well, you asked for it.Of his first 8 similarities, some apply to any photograph, some are irrelevant to holography, and some are simply untrue.1) The image on the Shroud is perhaps 20nm thick. The image of a hologram is captured in emulsion about 8000nm thick.2) Almost any picture has ‘good resolution.’3) The 3D quality of the Shroud is qualitatively different from the 3D quality of a hologram, which does not record any information about distance by means of image intensity.4) Very few pictures can be seen from the back side.5) “Both have light coming from only 1 direction to form image.” If this statement means anything, it is untrue. It may be referring to the Shroud as a result of collimated radiation from a dead body, in which case the light rays would be parallel, but a a hologram relies on light coming from two directions in order to create an interference pattern, which is what a hologram is. One way of making a hologram is to have a single source, and the interference pattern is created by the reflection from the object coming back in the other direction. This requires a transparent film, which the Shroud is not.6) “Both images fade and or vanish when tilted to the far right or far left.” The Shroud does no such thing.7) Any monochrome picture is ‘single colour.’8) “Both images involve subject close to film plate to capture image (past 5cm there is no image formation on a reflection hologram) (I know because I tried it).” If the Shroud was created by light emanating from a body, then it would not be attenuated to zero over 5cm. If the Shroud image demonstrates such attenuation, then it is definitely not due to light. A hologram made using a single light source and transparent film works best if the object is very close to the film. However the Shroud is not transparent. A hologram made by a split beam and opaque film does not require the object to be as close as 5cm.The comment from YouTube is non-sense. Dave is hopelessly confused as to how a hologram is made, and none of his statements is true.

You appear to have done this with a small figurine of Christ’s head. Needless to say, the Shroud does not resemble your hologram in any way.Cellulose acetate is not a photographic emulsion. It is what the base of the film is made of.The thickness of a thick human hair is about 160um, the thickness of the enamel on a hologram about 8um, the thickness of the image on the Shroud is about 0.002um.Myrhh and aloes have very few properties in common with cellulose acetate. You may be suggesting that they are photosensitive, like photographic emulsion, but unlike cellulose acetate, and for all I know you might be correct.Acetate fabric certainly can’t be used to make holograms unless it is photochemically treated. There are several sources online, mostly for making ‘sunprints’, but the easiest way is to buy photo emulsion and paint it on yourself. Alternatively you can make up your own, as I did myself some years ago, demonstrating that whatever the failings of Picknett and Prince, their assertion that the chemicals and technology necessary for photography were available in the 14th century was broadly correct, even if it does not seem to have been used at all at that time, let alone for making the Shroud.Keep up the experimentation. Even if it does not demonstrate, or even lead to, any kind of proof, it often has the most interesting spin-offs which may, one day, make sense of the Shroud.","date":"July 22, 2015 at 10:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/the-shroud-is-a-holograph/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Shroud is a Holograph?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Sadly no, Angel.

There’s a surprise! I don’t think anybody here thinks that a medieval artist set out to create an image which could only be properly appreciated when intensity-inverted like a negative. And the various photographic hypotheses have not gained general acceptance, probably because no one can believe that having invented or discovered the technique, it would not have been used on lots of other things, surely some of which would survive to this day. Arguments (above) against such ideas are largely unnecessary.Also, I don’t think anyone disputes that the Shroud is unique (with the possible exception of some other Shrouds – see below). However, the fact that there are no other comparable 13th century images can be contrasted with the fact that there are no other comparable 1st century images either. Uniqueness by itself is no proof of anything.Thomas de Wesselow and others have rightly pointed out that there was no need nor tradition for a “miraculous” relic to bear such a realistic imprint; a point neatly set aside by Charles’s suggestion that the Shroud was never intended either as a relic or as witness to a miracle. Carlos is incorrect to suppose that a congregation would be confused between the ‘negative’, monochrome, “realistic” image left on the Shroud as a witness to death, and the positive vision of the risen Christ himself. The whole point of the image being as it is was to emphasise its unmiraculous nature. It was designed to look like the contact image left by a body beginning to decay, not like a the residue of a supernatural resurrection.There must have been very little requirement for this kind of image. Making Christian shrouds may have been the only occasion when it was thought necessary. Even today it is extremely rare, and mostly more of an exercise than an artistic endeavour. Google ‘Brian Lai’ for a modern example. Nevertheless, that does not mean it was untried, or impossible. It is difficult to reconstruct the Shroud of Besançon from such images as remain, but it too appears to have had ‘negative’ characteristics, and its provenance precedes that of the shroud. (It is surely special pleading to say that the real Shroud of Besançon was in fact the Shroud of Turin, taken there after a fire, and that the next Shroud of Besançon was just a rough copy. Besançon and Lirey are only about 200km apart. I think someone would have noticed.)Nor is the image particularly clear. I don’t understand John Klotz’s statement above, about “the fineness of the detail of the image. Assuming arguendo a block print, or a painting, the image is too fine for any known method of reproduction.” The shroud image shows no eyelashes, eyebrows, nostrils, collarbones, nipples or navel, all of which could be perfectly clearly indicated on a fairly average block print. As for the experiment carried out by Jackson, as described by Thibault Heimburger above, perhaps we should be allowed to check its accuracy for ourselves.I am lucky enough to have videotaped, in 1982, a BBC programme of the QED series shown in 1983 called “Shroud of Jesus: Fact or Fake?” At one point the presenter, Anthony Clare, says: “Jackson called in the police to do another test. These artists are trained to compile pictures using shades of light and dark. Jackson got them to paint a Shroud-like bust, but only in terms of shade equals height. There was a lot of cursing and swearing, but the result was quite interesting. What do you think? Almost as good as the Shroud? Not according to Jackson.” We see a couple of artists trying to sketch a face from two identical busts, placed at right angles to each other so that one is face on and one in profile. The “quite interesting” result (and only one of them) was not shown as it was drawn, but only as a negative. I have inverted it here so that we can see the original result, followed by the negative, and then the VP-8 image:Thibault, above, says: “The result? None of the pictures do show the 3D characteristics of the shroud body image.” And Jackson, in the programme, says: “In my opinion the degree of comparison between those police artists’ attempts is not as good as what we see on the Shroud”. I disagree. I think the VP-8 transformation is at least as good as the Shroud’s, if not better.Further on in the programme the BBC commissioned its own replica shroud from Dr Brian Sagar of the Shirley Institute, specially woven for the programme and painted by Susan Hilton. Remarkably, although the making of the fabric was noted by the BSTS (search for Brian Sagar on the shroud.com website), the success or otherwise of the painting was ignored. That is a pity, because there was a concerted effort to duplicate all the characteristics of the the Shroud, in as simple a medieval way as possible.Brian Sagar: “Our problem was to find something that would reproduce this, leaving no traces, because we find no evidence of materials like protein or pigments of any kind, or metal ions, with the possible exception of some calcium, which was there in quite large quantities. We tried several materials that we know from past experience degrade cellulose in this way, and in the end we settled for alum, a material widely used by artists in medieval times.”Narrator: “Having settled on alum to degrade the cloth, Susan [Hilton, the artist] had to find a pigment, so she could see what she was painting. She chose brazil wood, often used with alum, and so popular in the middle ages that they even named a country after it. … For a canvas she used modern linen cloth that was specially woven to be like the real Shroud. That was sized with gum arabic, which contains calcium. … Finally a mixture of more gum arabic and alum was the medium to take the brazil wood pigment. The rest was up to Susan’s artistic skill.…And the finished product goes off for a bit of aging. [Cloth placed in an oven at 190°C for an unspecified time] We know that in the 15th century the Shroud was washed, in order, they believed, to test its authenticity. They probably used soda ash to get rid of those stubborn stains, like alum and brazil wood. [Cloth boiled in a large beaker]…Well, there’s the result. Looks good at a distance, and the closer you get, the less you see. [Close up] Tests showed that chemically everything was washed away except calcium and iron, and under the microscope the effect is strictly on the surface. It’s all very like the real Shroud. But the 3D test still has to be passed. Viewed from this side [The side with the epsilon blood mark], the real Shroud looks a bit better than Susan’s painting, but turn the other cheek [Image rotated slowly through about 100°] and there’s very little difference. All in all it looks as though our fake is extraordinarily like the real thing.”So. No gesso, but a sizing of gum arabic. Would that show up in a protein test?","date":"January 16, 2015 at 1:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/15/there-is-another-reason-charles-freeman-is-wrong/","cat":"image_theory","title":"There is another reason Charles Freeman is wrong"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Here is a description of the programme described above.Minutes0          Introduction.1          Prof. J.M.

Well yes and no.Fanti and Maggiolo did a lot of deconvolution of some photographs of the back side, and managed to derive a faint correspondence of the hair, moustache and nose, an even fainter correspondence of the hands area, and nothing resolvable from anywhere else. Given that the ‘normal’ image is entirely superficial, they assumed that the ‘back’ image was also entirely superficial, and consequently that the fibres between the two images did not carry the image through. They also show that the image on the back is not due to the frontal image “showing through,” as it might if it were much darker. They do not describe the back image as ‘smaller’; the correspondence of the bloodstains (which appear clearly) is accurate. They do describe it as having some slight differences from the front (specifically the nose appears more symetrical).The secondary image is in keeping with Rogers’s hypothesis. If an entire sheet is washed in a weak solution (and/or suspension) and allowed to dry, the solute appears concentrated on the outer fibres of the sheet, and minimally in the middle. The tightness of the weave may also prevent penetration to the middle anyway. I have not confirmed Rogers’s vaporograph ideas myself (cadaverine and putrescine seem remarkably difficult to get hold of…), but IF the image on the shroud is due to emanescing gases reacting only with the solute layer, and IF the gases penetrated the cloth, then I would expect an image on both sides but not in the middle, and considerably stronger and better defined on the contact side.The reaction of (e.g.) putrescine with starch is a Maillard reaction, so IF Rogers’s ideas are at all valid, then the discovery of the ‘back’ image certainly does not blow them away.I agree with Bippy that nearly all the naturalistic theories are flawed, and that, so far, none have produced wholly convincing explanations. However, even if they all ‘tumbled down’ I fear they are truly all science will ever have to offer. There is no scientific paradigm for the investigation of ‘unnatural theories,’ however true they may be. I don’t know where you got the idea that Science was the pursuit of truth. Only non-Scientists think that! Science is the gradual refinement of models that describe or explain observed phenomena – methodologically natural if you like – and it does a pretty good job of it. For truth however, you have to go to Philosophy or Theology.","date":"December 29, 2012 at 1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi ArtScience, good of you to join in! I have been a member of the British Shroud of Turin Society for donkey’s years, but began my present series of experiments as a result of renewed enthusiasm following the recent National Meeting of the BSTS. The two most active blogs seemed to be shroudstory (this one) and shroudofturinwithoutallthehype, so I began to read them, and start from there. I never take anybody’s word for granted if I can avoid it, so whenever possible I like to refer to original authors. I now have a copy of Pellicori and Miller’s paper on ultra-violet fluorescence, for example, and also Fanti and Maggiolo’s discussion on the image on the ‘back’ of the shroud. Perhaps curiously, the former’s photos are not as good as the one in Rogers’s “Chemist’s Perspective” and the latter do not actually include a straight photo of the ‘back’ side, which I had to Google for.Anyway, equipped with a school laboratory (I should say I live and work at a residential school, with continued access to ‘my’ lab in the holidays) I set to work, starting with the long-term axiom: “The image on the shroud cannot be a scorch because scorches fluoresce but the shroud image does not.” With a bas relief, a UV lamp and a sheet of linen, it was easy to discover that although fluorescence is an invariable associate of scorching, it appears as a surrounding ‘aura’ to a scorch, while the discoloured fibres themselves do not fluoresce. (unlike cotton, as I discovered much later, where the brown image itself glows brighter than the background under UV light). Further experiments showed that it was extremely difficult to prevent a scorch from travelling through the cloth and producing a clear image on the ‘back’ side, except by gently brushing the surface with a very hot spatula. However on obtaining some twill-woven cotton (I couldn’t obtain twill linen), it is very noticeable that the ‘back’ image was then much weaker than the front, compared to the 1/1 weave linen I was using. Returning to UV, it then became apparent that although strictly speaking the visible image does not fluoresce, the whole image area fluoresces quite brightly, so that any extra fluorescence produced by scorching could be difficult to detect. Rather to my surprise,I find that this background fluorescence can be obtained from myrhh (which is fluorescent in its own right, or simply heating the cloth to a little over the boiling point of water (say 150C or so).As to blood stains. Observations of photographs of threads are pretty inconclusive, I think. It appears that a solvent called diimide removes bloodstains to such an extent that the fibres beneath go white (i.e. no image). However it is not clear whether the same solvent applied to image fibres without blood, or indeed non-image fibres which are ‘yellowed with age’ has the same result. It may be that diimide removes everything, including any image, in which case the idea that there is no image under the blood stains is distinctly not-proven. You have noticed, I think, my capitalising of the word IF in my posting above. I have carried out a number of experiments with gravy browning, which in my bottle consists almost entirely of ‘ammonia caramel’ in water. The chemical is reasonably equivalent to the ‘impurity layer’ postulated for the shroud, with the advantage of being easily visible. Allowed to dry and teased apart, it is apparent that the colour appears principally on the outer surfaces of a cloth and, depending on how well it is soaked or rubbed in, rather less so within the thickness of a thread, or in places where two threads overlap. How much of this is due to evaporation concentration, and how much due to a failure to penetrate in the first place is difficult to say. Either way, Colin Berry’s latest post on shroudofturinwithoutallthehype reminds us that image formation had at least some effect on the structure of the fibres beneath it, which are described as altogether more fragile than non-image fibres.I think I’ve gone on long enough for the general readers of this blog!

After cooking a piece of linen for 20 minutes or so at 150C, or after smearing it with myrhh oil (or both, I guess), it glows quite cheerfully under UV light. In the first case it appears a faint yellow-brown under visible light (‘yellowed with age’), and in the second it has an oily translucency. Subsequent scorching at low temperatures (250C say) actually decreases the overall fluorescence. This is because the brown scorch marks do not fluoresce, so the more there are of them, the less area of fluorescent cloth is left. I do not know if it it makes a difference whether the ‘overall’ fluorescence is applied before or after the ‘image’ fluorescence.And yes; putrescine and cadaverine are amines produced by decomposing flesh.

You can read how I got on in my comments on Colin Berry’s blogs, if you’re interested. I’m writing here because I want to defend my approach (and Thibault’s, possibly). Whatever the actual mechanism for producing the shroud’s image, a real understanding of how linen behaves under a variety of circumstances is a worthwhile study.

I found Thibault’s paper very interesting and very worthwhile – and I wish I had a good microscope camera!It seems clear that there are at least two effects that have to be explained: the overall discolouration of whole threads, and the superficial darkening of the topmost fibres.

However, it also seems that the image is visible on the back side of the shroud Although I have not seen close-ups of the fibres on the back of the shroud, this suggests that the discolouring mechanism, starting at the top surface, somehow flowed completely around the fibres, discolouring the back surface too, without actually affecting the fibres themselves.

I have a once trendy office toy, which consists of a horizontal mesh about 15cm square, pierced with thousands of vertical steel rods about 8cm long. At rest, the rods all hang at the same level, but when the grid is lowered over an object, the steel rods adjust to the height of the point they touch, and an exact representation of the object appears, modelled in steel, 8cm above the object. If I knew what it was called I’d reference a picture of it; they used to be very common. Anyway, I can’t believe there isn’t a digital computerised version of this, probably using a laser beam instead of steel rods. The height data thus aquired could be imaged as a 3-D representation, as on ImageJ, or the numbers could be converted into a grey-scale, and a “shroud-image” produced. I think you would get quite a good version, and not a “fuzzy, ghost-like representation.”Next, I also take issue with: “There is no correlation in a photograph between the density of the imprint and the distance to the object.” In theory, of course this is true, and there are a number of clever artistic installations that bear this out. A series of flat black curtains at different distances from a camera ought to, and often do, produce the illusion of a single plane, and great surprise in an audience when a man walking between them seems just to appear and dissapear in and out of nowhere. However, in practice there often is some correlation between intensity and distance, and faces, especially, bear this out. Consider a white sphere, lit from directly in front. Does it appear in a photo as a disc? No. As the surface of the sphere slopes away from the frontal plane, the angle it makes with that plane reflects less and less light back to the camera, and in the photo the sphere is darker at the edges than it is in the middle. Much the same happens with faces – essentially pale spheres lit from directly in front. However, in detail, it would be truer to think of four or five such spheres squashed together, a big one for the forehead, a small one between two slightly larger ones for the nose and cheeks, and another for the chin. Each sphere appears equally bright where its surface is tangential to the plane in front of the face, which is why in the shroud, and in many photographs, the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin all appear more or less equally bright, and more or less equally high on an ImageJ repesentation. The more angled the surface of the ‘sphere’, the sides of the nose say, or the slopes of the eye sockets, the more different they are in intensity from the ‘flat’ frontal surfaces, and the greater the appearance of distance.In this way, by coincidence more than anything else, the distance/intensity colouration of the shroud image, which is probably real, resembles the distance/intensity colouration of a photograph.I’m not sure what the parameters of this observation are. Photos of people, as I have demonstrated on this blog, do show this correlation, while the full moon appears quite flat. Is this due to our inability to resolve contrast at such high illumination, given that the background is so dark? I don’t know.","date":"November 29, 2013 at 10:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/this-may-be-the-biggest-mystery-of-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"This may be the biggest mystery of all?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“The Gilberts were pioneers in spectrographic analysis.

Carmel … From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes and does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin.” Later, she does indeed list nine different samples sites, and says that the other eight are all different from the Jerusalem/Shroud samples. She does not say if they were tested, but a geological map of Israel shows the extent of the Turonian limestone upon which Jerusalem is built, and her inference is fair enough. Turonian limestone is, however, fairly common throughout the world.I don’t know where you got the Gilberts identification from. Their sample plan shows that they did not look at either of the knee-caps, and only the instep of one foot. They did look at the nose.

The STuRP team did take samples from the right heel (1DB) and right kneecap (2CF), but not the left heel, left kneecap or nose.

Until that time, they were unanimous in declaring the image to be a feature of the shroud itself, and were confident that no coating of any kind was involved, even though “we expected to find starch on the shroud.” I do not find the discovery of an entirely superficial layer of starch created by an evaporation gradient very convincing, although I agree that it would be a convenient explanation.The idea that the expectation of finding starch on the shroud meant that they didn’t look for it, is ludicrous. Rogers’s photo of a few blue strands resulting from the evaporation of a ‘very dilute solution of a blue dye’ is interesting, but needs to be supplemented by experiments involving a rather less dilute solution of something starchy to contribute to an explanation of the shroud image. We also need to consider what should happen when the toasted coating was subsequently subject to a soaking in water, as evinced by the water-stains.Rogers concluded by believing that “a combination of relatively rapid decomposing impurities on the surface of the cloth, with transfer/diffusion of catalytic compounds from a body” could account for the image. The relevance of his sideline into thermal radiation direction, and his mention of calculating “the temperature of a surface that would be sufficient to caramelise any of the possible sugars or starches on a cloth” is thus somewhat dubious. It reads as though as least some of his mind was on thermal, rather than chemical, degradation.One thing that Rogers explains well, and which I believe to be true, exactly contradicts Mottern, London and Morris’s paper on the X-ray examination of the shroud. He says, of the manufacture of Holland cloth: “Considerable material was lost during the bleaching process, and the newer linens are less dense, as can be seen with the Holland cloth.

They do not show bands of different thread in the weave.”Mottern et al agree that “the holland cloth is a more loosely woven fabric than the linen,” but then say: “A few measurements indicate that the linen threads [of the shroud] are rather uniform 0.15mm. In contrast the thread diameters of the holland cloth vary from 0.1 to 0.45mm.” They also say: “The bands of high and low densities which run along the length and across the width are the result of the different thread diameters of the backing cloth. … In contrast, the linen threads are more uniform in diameter.” Mottern et al also describe the holland cloth as cotton. Although Rogers was referring to colour and Mottern to thread thickness, their divergent opinions of the homogeneity of the two cloths are irreconcilable.","date":"September 4, 2013 at 9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think daveb may be right, but it’s only fair to point out that John Heller, Walter McCrone Roger Morris, and Gerald Lucotte reported finding limestone ‘dust’ on the Shroud tapes (or hoovering) taken from the 1978 sampling.

No evidence for a scorched medium can be seen.”Quote #3: “Microchemical studies of yellow fibrils taken from tape samples of the pure-image area have shown no indication for the presence of dyes, stains, inorganic pigments, or protein-, starch-, or wax-based painting media.”Quote #4: Direct visual observations of image areas that intersect scorch and water stains reveal nothing that might suggest the presence of organic dyes or water-, protein-, or starch-based painting media.”And is it, in fact true that because “we expected to find starch on the shroud, so we did not specifically look for it”?

It is not clear whether their quotations from Mills come directly from his paper or from Knight and Lomas’s book The Second Messiah (1997), which uses Mills quite extensively for scientific support, and whose own photographic hypothesis Allen is keen to denigrate!Here are some significant passages from Allen et al’s article.“Mills is good enought to admit that although not ‘individually demanding’, the particular set of circumstances he needs for this image formation is ‘highly unlikely.’ ”“Singlet oxygen, contrary to the claims of Kight and Lomas, can only be produced by enzymic action within the phagocytes of the body. It is not possible for this highly reactive radical to pass to the outside of the human body. Mills also correctly explains that ‘it is not expected that a charged ion would be able to cross the cell membrane and enter the gas phase’, but he does go on to state that the excited form of the oxygen molecule, known as singlet oxygen (symbolised as 1 delta g O2) behaves as an activated form of normal oxygen and consequently is able to ‘cross membranes such as those in the lungs and red blood corpuscles’. This statement is somewhat misleading because in fact the activated oxygen is produced within the red blood corpuscle as part of the pentose phosphate shunt and is thus unable to escape the cell membrane as it is in existence for only a few nanoseconds”.All this is somewhat above my pay-grade, but it may be interesting to hear Colin’s comments.","date":"October 8, 2014 at 11:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/to-revisit-a-stochastic-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Revisit a Stochastic Process"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Gosh!

(He said, dogmatically…)Scientists weigh up evidence and assess probabilities. They suggest, they propose, they infer. Rogers was no exception. Although it is clear that he did not think much of religion in general, or particularly that the explanation for the image was miraculous, he was even clearer in his rejection of dogmatism. If the “Chapter One” referred to by Yannick is that of A Chemist’s Perspective, then a couple of quotes that will be familiar to him will illustrate the point.“Persons who believe in absolutes will be unhappy with science. Scientists will be unhappy with persons who demand that they “make up your minds.”“A scientist has no right to demand that a devout person withhold devotion of the Shroud until all of the scientific evidence is in. A devout person has no right to tell a scientist that he must stop all observations because everything that is needed is known from scriptures or feelings.”Later he even quotes Richard Feynman: “… if a thing is not scientific, if it cannot be subjected to the test of observation, this does not mean that it is dead, or wrong, or stupid.” “This does not mean that those things are unimportant. They are, in fact, in many ways the most important.” I think that’s quite generous from one whose instinct was to reject the supernatural altogether.Finally, to suggest that Rogers  “clearly say that searching a supernatural explanation for the Shroud (just like Jackson, Rinaudo, Moran, Fanti, DiLazzaro and a bunch of other researchers have done in recent years) is not at all a valid part of the true scientific method,” is not, in fact, true.

I have been unable to produce red fluorescence even when scorching cloth in an oxygen-free environment, so there may be something else which affected that fluorescence. Secondly, the entire cloth fluoresces quite brightly on its own, and I have no idea why. However it is difficult therefore to judge whether the faint image marks have a faint fluorescence of their own or not. My own experiments with heated spatulas, bas reliefs and so on invariably produce significant fluorescence as soon as, or even before, any discolouration of the cloth, but if the cloth was pre-treated, for example with an alkaline wash or primer, then the lower temperature required to produce discolouration might do so without producing fluorescence. I myself currently incline to a chemical rather than a heat ‘scorch,’ which might discolour cloth without producing any fluorescence at all.","date":"March 17, 2014 at 1:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/two-comments-promoted-colin-berry-has-cracked-the-shroud-enigma/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Two Comments Promoted:  Colin Berry Has Cracked the Shroud Enigma?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thank you for your comments, Gentlemen.

I have experimented at length with UV fluorescence, and am currently working on superficiality. I have dabbled in different possible coatings, and different possible reactants with them such as ammonia and urea. The 3D quality of the image is a more long term goal, as my software is currently not up to it.Needless to say I have not made a shroud – I haven’t even made a face – but I have begun to understand the processes required to do so, and understood that very few people, including the sainted Ray Rogers, have managed to discolour linen at all, with anything, without also having to heat it up to temperatures that can be interpreted as scorching.I’m afraid I will not be exploring the quantum possibilities of the shroud. I have a school laboratory, a UV light and a microscope, but not a Large Hadron Collider. Not even a Small Hadron Collider, in fact. Sadly I suspect current speculation about quantum processes forming the image can scarcely be termed even a hypothesis. As the underlying principle for the whole of physics, it is, of course, behind lasers and MIR machines, but also candles, biscuits and butterflies, all of which were developed without any reference to their underlying principles.Back to the text. We should not get hung up on the 48 hours thing. If the shroud image was not created by a decomposing body, then there is no need for it to have taken any particular length of time.

Rather than reading absurdities behind the text that aren’t there – thinking that I or Colin call di Lazzaro an amateur for example – just take what is written as it comes. What am I to make of this?“Di Lazzaro never said that it was radiation.”followed by this:“Of course VUV radiation is pure radiation.”and then this:“I do not believe that radiation had anything to do with the image.”What on earth does this mean? Fortunately you followed up with:“Now, it seems that you have not understood why I used that term.” And you’re absolutely correct about that.And why did I say that Colin could proceed with Science while di Lazzaro waits for a change in paradigm. Because by his own admission Colin is on a journey of discovery concerning the image formation, while di Lazzaro has succeeded in what he wanted to do, but acknowledges that it cannot have happened without a miracle. After discussing the problems with Jackson’s hypothesis – “of a body wrapped by the Shroud that becomes mechanically transparent while emitting VUV radiation” – and Rogers’s experiments – “samples often were converted into a little amorphous powder and gas” – di Lazzaro explains that by finding the correct parameters he has succeeded in demonstrating that “VUV radiation is truly capable of generating a Shroud-like colouration of linen cloths.” But he goes on to admit that in terms of a dead body emitting these VUV pulses, something beyond the realm of science is required.“How can one untie the knot of this impasse? As scientists, we are not entitled to argue about theological and philosophical implications of a flash of VUV radiation as a possible by-product of resurrection. We are only qualified to investigate the complex chain of chemical and physical processes triggered by VUV radiation on cellulose/hemicellulose, that produce conjugated carbonyl groups as the chromophore, or, in simpler words, a Shroud-like colouration of linen. We did this scientific work, and we have made our experimental results and related arguments public, that is, in our papers.” Now all he can do is wait.So, go back to your gratuitous abuse: “How nice,coming as it is from the editor of the BSTS newsletter,” and see whether it is justified by what I actually said, rather than what you think I may have meant.Joe is completely correct in that a true assessment of the Shroud must not begin with an assumption that it is one thing or another. However, Science works by proposing an idea, and then attempting to justify or reject it. We may say: IF the cloth was made by an artist / by a corpse, then how might it have occurred? We may even say: perhaps it was by something outside the realm of science, but in that case it is pointless to try to investigate its cause further. Colin is exploring a painting hypothesis. To do that he must begin with an “IF the Shroud was made by an artist” assumption. di Lazzaro is exploring a radiation hypothesis. To do that he must begin with either an “IF a corpse can produce radiation” assumption or an “IF the Shroud was produced by a miracle” assumption, or there would be no point in pursuing his experiments.I believe David Mo was rather more dogmatic than I would be in declaring a 99% certainty that the Shroud is medieval, but that does not justify Antero’s “Once more skeptics show themselves ignorant about serious scientific studies on the Shroud and uncover their fanatic anti-authenticity agenda-driven comments.” As I have pointed out many times recently, non-authenticist views are almost invariably based on detailed study of the “serious scientific studies” while authenticists frequently appear not to have read it at all.","date":"April 1, 2015 at 6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/31/whats-to-like-over-on-colins-blog-right-now/","cat":"image_theory","title":"What’s to like over on Colin’s blog right now?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"« authenticists frequently appear not to have read it at all.»- This is not fair.Well ROFL, as the children say.What about: “Once more skeptics show themselves ignorant about serious scientific studies on the Shroud and uncover their fanatic antiauthenticity agenda-driven comments.”Is that fair?At least my claims are backed up by detailed evidence.

More the first than the second in my case. Anyway, OK’s FFTs are interesting, and best of all, offer anybody the chance to explore them on their own. However, I’m not sure he has destroyed the ‘painting’ hypothesis with his ‘lack of directionality’ evidence. Walter McCrone came up with the idea that the image could have been made by smudging a pigment laden finger across the cloth, but rejected it on the grounds that the threads would act as “snow-fences” (his word), so drifts of pigment would pile up against them as the finger moved across. I imagine that much the same would happen with paint, and no such drifts are observed anywhere. McCrone’s solution was to quote at some length from Sir Charles Lockwood’s book ‘Methods and Materials of Painting of the Great Schools and Masters’ which describes an unusual tempera, typical of England and Germany, which was ideal for painting on cloth, which was extremely dilute, and which appeared almost transparent. In these very dilute circumstances, there is no reason why and directionality would be apparent, even if the cloth were painted.There is also the possibility that the ‘paint’, if there was any, was dabbed on vertically, and the blood dripped on with a pipette. In these cases too, no directionality would necessarily be created.What I find quite strange about OK’s FFTs of the Shroud, and still need to explore, is that his photographs of the Shroud show very obvious directionality which is clear to the naked eye, namely the weave of the cloth. I find it curious that the FFT, which OK says can recognise directionality, is unable to recognise thick obvious diagonal stripes across the page. Or can it cunningly tell the difference between the directionality of the image and the directionality of the cloth, even from a simple black and white photograph?","date":"November 12, 2014 at 12:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/why-the-images-and-bloodstains-were-not-painted-on/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Why the images and bloodstains were not painted on"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m sure I misunderstand, OK.

He is correct in that, as it stands, the Shroud is far too ‘good.’ Charles will explain this better, no doubt, but I think the essence of a relic was not what it looked like, but how many red episcopal seals attested to its authenticity. Any old bone, any old coat, plants, ironmongery, even any old painting could attract thousands as long as it was solemnly assured to be genuine. At Glastonbury (though I was told this long ago and it may be apocryphal), worried that Walsingham was cornering the market in pilgrimages, it was enough simply to engrave “Hic iacet Arturus” on a slab to attract a new and plentiful source of income to the ‘authentic’ grave of King Arthur and his queen. There was no need to attempt to produce an authentic looking replica of something. If a miracle was involved in the production of a portrait, why shouldn’t it look like a painting anyway?That is why I am more interested in the epitaphios of Eastern Christian ritual. I was intrigued to see that the painting on linen referenced by MikeM a few posts ago is described as a Shroud. Many of the Fayum figures were full length portraits, apparently intended to be placed over the mummies of their subjects. The reason for this is not really known, and the practice died out in the 3rd century, but there may be an echo of it in some Byzantine rites of the Catholic Church, in which the body of Christ, represented by the eucharist, is placed on (and sometimes wrapped in) a cloth specifically stated to represent a shroud. Recently (well, for the last five hundred years or so!), this symbolic shroud (the epitaphios) actually has another shroud painted on it, and the body of Christ lying on that, and often an entire lamentation scene around it, so the cloth itself is a mere carrier for the representation, but echoes of the cloth as itself the shroud may be found in the katasarkion (also strachitsa or srachitsa), a plain linen sheet which is the first cover of the Byzantine altar, fastened to it and not removed after the altar is consecrated. Somewhere between the katasarkion and the epitaphios, I feel, there may have been an intermediate stage in which a cloth, representing the shroud, was given a plain image. There are various reasons why the cloth may have been long and thin (to drape over an altar about 2m long being one of them) and why the image of the dead body was represented as two figures lying head to head (to fill the cloth with image, and to have heads, rather than feet, directly under the rituals of the altar), two aspects of the Shroud which do not imediately make sense in the context of a real burial (when a single body-length sheet is more typical – although there are a few old Egyptian exceptions – and placing the body so that the last thing to be covered is the head also seems more appropriate).Pure speculation I agree, and if anyone can point me to the development of the epitaphios/katasarkion between, say, the iconoclasm and 1400 AD I’d be fascinated to read it, but development there must have been, and the Shroud would fit quite nicely in that gap. In this context, I feel, the exact nature of the painting could have been any of a number of things, including brush-and-paint or dabbing, colour or monochrome, realistic or impressionistic, or whatever.And finally – where are all the others? Well quite. There are no contemporary altar covers to compare the Shroud to at all, similar or dissimilar. Pity.

To clarify:a) the flax fibres were coated with something before they were spun into threads, perhaps as part of the purification process. If this were the case, and the image forming mechanism is strong enough to affect this layer, but not the rest of the fibre, I would expect the image forming mechanism to colour all around the fibres it affected, probably quite deeply into the thread, and by conduction along the coating, be visible on the back of the cloth. (The PCW hypothesis would produce a similar result). The appearance would look a bit like cloth does after it has been kept in an oven for a while – rather uniform.b) the threads were treated after they had been spun, perhaps as part of the weaving process. If this were the case, then ‘interior’ fibres, or the interior parts of fibres if they disappear into the middle of a thread would not be affected by the mechanism, but the image would appear at least deep into the valleys between the warp threads. It could also appear on the back by capillary action.c) the whole cloth was treated after being woven, perhaps as part of a washing process. In this case, the solutes appear prominently on the external faces of the cloth, and less, possibly much less, in the middle. This seems to be the basis of Rogers’s ammonia experiments, which were done on whole cloth.I too am not crazy about starch, as I don’t find it reacts as well as plain linen to heat or chemicals.

The other day I took some cloth to our local blacksmith, who kindly heated an iron bar (about 8 x 5 x 0.5 cm) to 1000°C – which you can tell partially by the sudden loss of magnetism at the Curie point (770°C) and partially by the colour, and then dropped it on the cloth. The first sample caught fire and burnt to shreds quite quickly, even in a tin with the lid only allowing a tiny amount of air in, but the second, which was from a different sample, behaved beautifully shroud-like, and although we threw a bit of water in after 10 minutes, the chars were restricted to the area of the bar. All 32 layers were neatly scorched in decreasing sizes, just like the Shroud.So far so good, but now comes the interesting bit. Having dried out the cloth and laid it on the floor, I set up a camera to photograph a good sample burn area, and then brought my UV lamp up to check the fluorescence. In all my previous experiments, I have had the lamp on, and brought the samples to it to be photographed, but this I think must be the first time that I have observed the fluorescence from the moment the lamp was switched on, as it were. To my amazement, the first thing to see was a thin red fluorescent border around the char holes, and none around the various nearby scorch marks, just as described on the Shroud. You may remember that I have never observed the red fluorescence, in spite of determined attempts to scorch cloth in an oxygen-free environment. However, while I was getting excited about this, the lamp continued to heat up – it takes about 5 minutes to reach full power – and the red fluorescence disappeared, and the familiar greeny-yellow fringe took its place, around the chars, and around the scorches, just as I have observed before, as seen in your posting of 19 Dec 2012, “Guest posting from Hugh Farey (yipee – another science bod!): here’s a snapshot of his current studies of scorching and uv fluorescence.”So, it seems to me that neither your UV source, nor that of the STURP team, is/was powerful enough to detect the fluorescence around the scorches, although it may have produced a red fluorescence around chars. The implications are that, yes, scorches always fluoresce, but only at high power. There is thus no reason why the ‘image’ of the Shroud is not a scorch!I’ll be writing all this up, with photos, in the December BSTS Newsletter.Cheers,Hugh","date":"December 19, 2015 at 10:44 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2015/12/16/does-thermally-induced-scorching-of-linen-always-produce-fluorescence-under-uv-rendering-it-invalid-as-a-model-for-the-turin-shroud-answer-most-definitely-no/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"Does thermally-induced scorching of linen ALWAYS produce fluorescence under uv, rendering it invalid as a model for the Turin Shroud?

This passage, from EGM above, illustrates the point. It is wildly speculative, wholly unconfirmed by experiment, and largely scientifically incoherent.“The processes of morphogenesis, growth, differentiation and regeneration are also explained by the structuring and regulating activity of the coherent biophoton field. The holographic biophoton field of the brain and the nervous system, and maybe even that of the whole organism, may also be basis of memory and other phenomena of consciousness, as postulated by neurophysiologist Karl Pribram an others.

I cannot say whether this means that “natural” linen is not fluorescent, but can be made so as part of the manufacturing process, or the other way round. Most modern sheets, and detergents, have fluorescing agents added so that they will come out “whiter than white” when washed.Incidentally, in the first 10 minutes or so of the remarkably dull St Louis conference video posted by Dan a day ago, there is a mild spat between John Jackson and Barrie Schwortz about the ambient reflected light during the STuRP investigations.

From my own researches I can say this:1) The UV photos of the Shroud were done by Miller and Pelicori and are published in the Journal of Biological Photography but are not available on the internet. Considerable care was taken to exclude any visible light emission from the UV source, so that the image captured on film was entirely due to fluorescence. I mention this because all the UV images show considerable background fluorescence which largely masks any extra due to image, scorches, blood serum and so on. There is no apparent fluorescence caused by the body image, but it is possible that there is some which is masked by the background. Those parts of the burn-scorches which are dark in visible light are also dark in UV, but they are often fringed in a pale reddish orange fluorescence, while the rest of the UV marks are greenish-blue. There seems to be no fluorescence attached to the ‘poker holes.’2) I have never been able to create reddish fluorescence using a scorch. When I heat an object and press it several times onto linen until it is cool, I find that at the lowest temperature to form a visible mark, however faint, it fluoresces brightly. I have not been able to make the cloth fluoresce without making a visible mark, but that may simply be that I have not had exactly the right temperature. As the temperature increases, the dark scorch/char itself does not fluoresce, but is surrounded by a bright halo which does.","date":"December 15, 2014 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes you did; that’s why I tried it.

As I understand it, the restoration of the Shroud in 2002, although not necessarily actually involving an iron, did flatten it out considerably, to the extent of increasing its length by 10cm or so. Anyone who wants to compare a ‘crease-before-the-image with a crease-after-the-image would do well to look at the creases bracketing the top and bottom of the face on the Shroud on shroudScope. On the “Enrie negative” page they are both very prominent, although the lower one is both brighter and has a faint ‘twin’ image just below. On the “Durante 2002” page, the top crease has all but vanished, while the lower one has widened considerably and resolved itself into two distinct lines (the upper darker than the lower) with a channel between them which is paler than the cloth above and below the crease marks. It is likely that the appearance of the upper crease in the Enrie photo is merely an artifact of the direction of the light and shadow, which is almost negated by the new flatness of the Shroud, while the colours of the lower crease are genuine linear discolourations of the cloth (no doubt enhanced by the light and shadow in the Enrie photo, but not removed by smoothing out the crease).Johyn (a typo or some atavistic ethnicity emerging?) is in good company in thinking that flattening the Shroud ‘beggars belief.’ John Jackson and several other students of the cloth were furious that the evidence of the creases was well-nigh destroyed as part of the new configuration of the Shroud.","date":"March 22, 2014 at 6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/21/so-then-why-is-there-an-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"So then, why is there an image?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Why is there an image?

I had a go myself but iPhoto (all I’ve got) is not subtle enough. It seems to me that the drop of blood right at the end of the distinctive 3 shape on the forehead has a light patch in the middle, which could be as a result of a thick encrustation peeling off. The other place is at the back of the head, where, to be frank, the blood stains look as if they have bubbles in them – again, light patches which may be the result of thick bits coming away. If there was no body image (scorch, if you like) under them, then the colour should be perhaps pale pink (???) being the stain left behind by the blood, and nothing else. If there is an image under them, then it should be darker, a combination of the brown image and and pink blood residue. Another place to look for pale spots in the blood might be the dribble from one of the feet, which clearly continues into places where there is no image.Back to Rogers. The paper I quoted does not seem to me to concern scorching at all, being all about nuclear radiation, specifically from thorium. How comparable the results of nuclear radiation are with lowish temperature scorching I don’t know. Having irradiated some flax for a week with thorium, it would have been pretty simply just to scorch a bit for comparison, but that was presumably not the object of Rogers’s exercise. His conclusion that, when examined under polarising light, image and non-image threads look the same (although one photo is very blurred) may be significant in terms of emitted particles, but I don’t think his paper establishes that it is relevant to scorching, at least not to me, or, presumably, you!There is a lot in the literature claiming that scorching always damages the medulla of flax fibres, and that the shroud fibres do not show such damage, but I have not found a paper that substantiates that yet. I’m a little perplexed as to the use of the word medulla, which (although it’s perfectly clear what it means) is usually applied to animal rather than plant material.Finally, I spent quite a happy time last night scorching cloth and looking at it under a 400X microscope, but it was all cotton, which isn’t really comparable, so I’m going to raid a tablecloth today…","date":"October 16, 2012 at 10:03 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

I haven’t read the original papers in any detail, but there seems to be some confusion between threads (being the long thin stuff the weaver used), fibres (being the little twisty bits that make up the threads), and cellulose molecules.  It is obvious that threads can be scorched on one side, you can see that with the naked eye. I think it is obvious under a microscope that fibres can be scorched on one side, or at least damaged more in one place than another, although I haven’t been able to verify that personally (yet); but I know nothing about the molecular composition of each fibre, and would need to read the original papers more carefully than I have done so far to see if the polarised light experiments really do preclude scorching, which I doubt. As I understand it, cellulose is a fairly elaborate and extensive network of sub-components (glucose units), which can surely be damaged in some places without affecting others. Heating it is not, I surmise, an all or nothing affair – unlike, say, heating a single glucose molecule, which cannot but cause total decomposition.As to the second, I suppose that if I were wedded to a photographic or chemical or burst-of-cosmic-rays origin, I would cling to any evidence, however tenuous, that the marks are not scorches. Nothing else springs to mind, but perhaps you have better ideas than I.Anyway, my next job is to try to understand Ray Rogers’s “Radiation Effects, Aging and Image Formation” whose abstract concludes that “the image could not have involved energetic radiation of any kind; photons, electrons, protons, alpha particles and/or neutrons.” That seems quite dogmatic!You may hope, and I wish you well, that positive evidence alone is enough to establish a theory; but in practice, I think, it is usually necessary to disprove negative evidence as well, especially if it comes from a reputable source.","date":"October 15, 2012 at 1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

I’ve done experiments of various kinds on pieces of cloth for 30 years (heat, light, UV, acids, alkalies, myhrr, aloes, sweat, you name it) without convincing myself that I know how the image was made. However I have never had access to the high-definition (although sadly not high enough for what I want now) photography of Shroud Scope, and it really has just struck me that we’re all working from pictures, with all their optical imperfections, rather than the artifact itself. I don’t even know if all the diagonal hatching (shadow, reflection or refraction) is actually visible at all in some lighting conditions. Part of the clarity of your scorch from the mask in your banner above comes from the exposure of the cloth so that the individual threads which are not scorched are hardly visible; it may be that the shroud would look very similar if it was photographed in the same way. It should at least be much easier to differentiate scorch marks (if so they are) from liquid flows (if so they are) which would be expected to follow the ridges and furrows of the threads.As for my fascination for minutiae, there are a steadily decreasing number of fields open to original discovery by independent researchers with no facilities, and any original discoveries i have made are indeed extremely minute. The Shroud is not something I’ve thought much about for a few years, as I’ve been concentrating on the history of the Olympic Games recently, but again, delving into some tiny details to try to derive original research from them.Here’s another bit of minutiae, for example. The famous crease across the neck of the shroud has a sort of dip, or shallow V, almost in the centre, in a light patch of the beard. Is that V real, or is the shroud lightly creased vertically at that point, and we are looking at the horizontal crease going down one side and up the other? If the V is real, then why is it there or how did it get there? It may be trivial, but it’s the sort of thing that absorbs me.If you’ve found my entry on the BSTS meetup site, you’ll know that I’m a Catholic and a Science teacher, and might have thought I was a “let’s-try-and-invent-some-science-to-explain-a-miracle” sort of scientist. Nothing could be further than the truth. In common with most orthodox Catholic theologians who have faced up to miracles (including the Pope, according to the second volume of his life of Jesus) I fully expect the accounts of what happened physically to be thoroughly explicable in conventional scientific terms. Theologians are now exploring how (and why) these events affected the people who witnessed them and how they were used to illustrate a new (and better?) life style; they are not (mostly) bothering about the science. There are still fundamentalist Creation and Miracle (and Shroud) so-called scientists, but they are not theologians.

Presumably the back of the shroud reverses this, and the other three quarters of the warp is visible, the threads running longitudinally from one end to the other, and only one quarter of the weft.I believe in the early days (probably round about the STURP examination) there were attempts (or was an attempt) to “remove directional markings” or something similar, by means of the very limited editing software then available. The object of that was to try to prove that there were no brush strokes, and so that the image was not a painting.

Or are they, literally, optical illusions?Somewhere in your blog you reproduce an extreme close-up of some threads with ‘blood’ on them (Mark Evans: Dense blood stain, scourge mark on back). If one ignores the blood, one  appears to to be looking at a wall of hairy bricks. If however, I blow the photo up to full screen, and then walk backwards away from it, then the vertical shadows between the bricks seem to become more prominent, and one sees two broad diagonal bands each made of closely spaced short vertical black lines. Needless to say, there are no such diagonal markings on the photo.So, if all the diagonal bands observed on the shroud are observable in a similar way, then they are optical illusions, not real markings, so what would the image look like without them? That’s what I was getting at.","date":"October 14, 2012 at 5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

I guess most “ordinary white light” includes a fair amount of UV anyway.

The image was very clearly visible (brown on yellow), but then I washed it, ironed it with a hot iron, boiled it and generally  tried to remove all traces of the experiment, but the image remained, albeit so faint that the BSTS were unable to reproduce it in their journal. it had, of course, a negative quality about it, in that the lighter areas of the photo changed the colour of the cloth least.I certainly don’t believe that the image on shroud was formed like that, nor by hanging a life-sized image (or real dead person) outside a pin-hole camera the size of a room, or any of the other photographic ideas currently in circulation, and of course it is true that in any of these cases the image is technically formed by the reaction of the sensitive chemical with the linen, not by the direct energy of light rays. (A similar experiment can be performed by shining a very contrasty slide onto a large leaf and carrying out a standard school-level starch test with iodine).I have to say that I don’t look forward to Stephen Jones’s photographic evidence (if so it be) with any great hope of being convinced; however, I still have difficulty with the hot brass statue idea, although the bas relief variation is quite compelling.","date":"October 12, 2012 at 6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

If I do the same with a spoon, the scorch is about 3cm wide, corresponding to a radiated distance of 3 or 4mm. If I heat a spatula for ten seconds or so, and press it on the cloth, I make a mark which superficially looks very similar. At least it’s the same colour.However, under the microscope it is obvious that the contact marks are very specific, just on the thread-fibres which have been in contact, and definitely not continuing into the places where the fibres go underneath other threads, while the radiated marks are much more even, and, when the threads are separated, it is difficult (read impossible) to see any difference between places directly exposed and places where the fibres passed under others.Why this should be I can’t really say. I guessing that under radiated heat the fibres are able to conduct the energy away and discolour all the way along, but in contact they can’t. Something to do with the suddenness of the arrival of the heat?Back to UV. I made some marks by pressing a hot spatula along a strip of linen, then cut the linen in two longitudinally, dividing all the marks in two, and washed one half in slightly soapy water then left it to soak for an hour, then dried it and put it back with the untouched half for comparison. Sadly, although the scorch marks seem to have been somewhat scrubbed off, the UV fluorescence is apparently unchanged. Can you think of anything else I might do to get rid of it?My camera is not good enough to adjust for focussing in the dark, and still pictures are disappointing; however a video-camera seems to be able to manage a bit better. Would you like me to send some screen shots of these experiments? I have found an email address from an earlier post, and would be happy to do so if you’d like.Next, the BSTS meeting was interesting (particularly as there were life-size photos to pore over), and although in principle extremely controversial, very polite! David Rolfe did not pursue the Dawkins Challenge at all. He read out a goodwill message from Ian Wilson (now living in New Zealand) with interpolations of his own, from which two new movements came to light. Someone in America is reviewing the pollen sample slides, both those taken by Max Frie and those by other members of the STURP team, with a view to explaining the rather different interpretations different people have made of them; and also (quite exciting) a mould for making Lirey/Cluny pilgrimage badges has been found. I didn’t know about that, but immediately Googled “Lirey pelerinage moule” and find a photo of it as the front cover of a book – still only published in France as yet. It does not seem to be the mould for the famous badge, but certainly for one very similar.Thomas de Wesselow then expounded in detail why he thought the two components of the shroud image, image and blood, were “technically, stylistically and conceptually” incompatible with 14th century art or forgery (I know you and many others disagree, and he did not reveal anything blindingly new, but he set out his arguments clearly and with many illustrations), and then went on, perhaps more diffidently, to explain why he thinks the shroud and The Risen Christ were in fact one and the same, and thus the foundation of Christianity. I found that difficult to take, I must say. Christian or not, to found a lasting worldwide religion on the basis of a stained sheet seems quite a tough deal to me – probably more of a miracle than bringing a man back to life!Finally a medical lady whose name I didn’t catch ran through the image as pathology, with some real Roman nails and a flagrum mock-up based on the famous remains found in Pompei.

Not finding any in the house I ebayed a piece and have spent a day happily experimenting in my school laboratory, with a Bunsen Burner, a couple of microscopes and a UV lamp. Firstly, I cannot, at any temperature, scorch the stuff without making it fluoresce. This was quite exciting for me as most cloth these days fluoresces anyway (probably being treated with something) but the linen wasn’t/didn’t until I heated it. Placing a hot spatula on it, in the dark, illuminated only by the light of a Bunsen burner and the UV lamp, produces a dark scorch, of varying depth, surrounded by a clear halo of pale green fluorescence, which also fills up the scorch area itself, except where it is charred to carbon. Carrying out the experiment you suggested, of repeatedly placing the hot object against the cloth until nothing seems to occur, shows that even when the scorch is barely visible, or even not visible at all, the fluorescence is quite clear.Next, trying to compare linen with cotton, it seemed to me that the cotton did not conduct heat as well as linen, because, after pulling apart some charred fragments under a microscope, it was easier to obtain banding (the threads not coloured where they passed underneath others, but charred where they were on the top) with cotton than with linen. A very good effect could be produced even on linen, however, if instead of heating a spatula, I used a pin, and rolled it gently over the surface (instead of pressing down with the spatula).Remarkably, the most shroud-like markings I could make were when, so that I could find them more easily, I drew a circle around one with a fibre-tipped pen. Astonishing. The ink remained only on the topmost fibres (and, when a fibre was examined under high power, only on one side of some fibres), and clearly didn’t flow into the dips where the threads pass over and under each other, except very occasionally when it seemed to stain a few individual fibres and turned up on the other side of the cloth. I don’t know how big ink particles are, but nothing particulate could be resolved at 400X. The marks were blue, of course…Lots more experiments suggest themselves to me, but I thought I’d let you know how I got on before I go to the meeting tomorrow.

I am open to the possibility that the image was not formed by a real body, or even a real body shape – not convinced, by any means, but certainly open to the possibility. I would hardly have spent the last few months singeing linen if I had rejected the possibility of a scorch. However, in this case, my personal views are irrelevant. We are constructing a critical summary of “A critical summary of … hypotheses” and surely, any such document that begins by denying the possibility of half the hypotheses it seeks to summarise deserves a certain amount of criticism. I agree that the pollen, the limestone and the artistic archaeology are evidence in favour of authenticity, but all of them have been sensibly queried, and are not as persuasive to me as they are to you.Mario Latendresse’s paper is excellent in its way, but I think fails to comment on some things and fails to notice others. He suggests that the biggest distortions of image should lie where the covering cloth is most steeply angled away from the horizontal. These include the sides of the arms (not commented upon), the hips, and the sides of the legs (not noticed). The width of the hips ‘photographically’ (without distortion) can be calculated as line B + line D + the distance between them (11 squares x 1.11cm) – about 27.2cm. By counting squares, the ‘image’ of the hips has a width of 36.6cm. This 35% increase is charmingly dismissed with “some observable widening of the hip is expected” and “such an apparent widening has been observed.” However the widest part of the front of the body (hips) corresponds in the rear to the buttocks. Measurements using Shroud Scope give about 36cm across the hips, and, not too surprisingly, about 34cm across the buttocks. Now if we assume that the hip-image is distorted by draping cloth, and the buttock image is not, it is clear that the front would be far too thin.As for the legs, Latendresse’s photos show his cloth draping the legs quite closely, but he does not explore the distortion thus caused. If I measure the bottom edge of his photo with a ruler, and then in his cloth squares, I get an undistorted width of about 24.7cm, and an image width of 33.3cm, an increase of 35% across the width of the image, not borne out by the image on the shroud. I do not think Latendresse has proved his point.","date":"February 7, 2013 at 7:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/07/topic-of-the-day-7-vertical-mapping-of-a-human-form/","cat":"topic_for_today","title":"Topic of the Day (#7): Vertical Mapping of a Human Form"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"In a word – yes and no.

Although I don’t really disagree with his conclusions – the man is quite an ordinary man – I think the mathematical calculations give a wholly unwarranted precision, given the subjective nature of almost all the measurements, and the assumptions made about angles of the head, knees and ankles and so on.Early on in the paper, there is quite an interesting diagram of the two images superimposed on one another. It is worth trying this out for yourself, using either a shroudscope image or, better for this purpose, the photos at http://shroud.wikispaces.com/PROPERTIES. The two images are, indeed superimposable. However, if the man had bent knees, and the bottom of the shroud was laid flat, and the top was draped over the body, the bottom image should show a) considerable foreshortening, and b) no image between the buttock and the heels. If (as Marinelli speculates) the bottom of the shroud was held up by pillows so that it makes contact with the legs, the legs would still appear shorter underneath than on top, as the top surface has to drape over the knees, while the bottom surface does not.Other uncertainties concern the width of the image, which might be extended on top by some factor due to being draped across the body, and extended on the bottom by the weight of the body flattening out the buttocks, etc.Given these speculations, look at Marinelli’s Section 5 – Uncertainty Analysis. My interpretation…1) We don’t know whether the image is rounded slightly over the top of the head, or is a flat image. Guess 3% error.2) We don’t know if the head was bent on not. Guess plus or minus 3cm.3) We don’t know if the linen has stretched. Guess 2% error.4) We don’t know if the draping of the cloth makes the front image too long in respect of the back. Guess 7.5% too long. [In my opinion it would make more sense to call the dorsal image 7.5% too short, but that’s by the bye]5) We don’t know if the back of the sheet was brought up to make contact with the legs. Guess 1% too long. [This doesn’t mean anything to me]6) We don’t know if wrinkles on the sheet mean the images occupy a greater length than they should. Guess 2% too long.7) We don’t know if the S-bend of the backbone may be relevant. Guess add 1cm. [Nor does this]8) A man lying down is longer than him standing up. Guess 2cm too long.9) We don’t know if the linen has shrunk. Or not. Guess let’s leave it as it is.If we take the uncertainty extremes of all Marinelli’s guesses, we have to accept the man in the shroud was between about 4 feet and 10 feet high, with arms and legs roughly in proportion.As I say, if you want to compare the man in the shroud to any modern set of anthropomorphic standards, you were much better to do it yourself.","date":"July 10, 2013 at 5:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/07/topic-of-the-day-7-vertical-mapping-of-a-human-form/","cat":"topic_for_today","title":"Topic of the Day (#7): Vertical Mapping of a Human Form"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I consider it an honour for the author of such an excellent paper to comment on my comment. His sort of experimentation is exactly what the shroud world needs, and his explanation of how he derived his findings is a model of clarity. Nevertheless, I do not think that the principle point of the paper – that the image on the shroud is compatible with a draped rather than a horizontal shroud, has been established. The places where distortion would be most visible would be the places where the shroud dropped furthest away from horizontal, such as the back of the head, the sides of the arms, hips and legs, and not across the face or along the arms. Carefully laying his sheet across his model, there are several places (lines B and D being his best examples) where he finds that a draped cloth would produce an image up to 35% wider than the ‘photographic’ image which might be expected from a horizontal cloth. I do not find this distortion in the shroud. Where the front and back images can be directly compared, i.e. across the widest part of the body in the hip region, the distances are very similar. It doesn’t matter at what magnification or what image of the shroud you use. Either one finds that the ventral image is 35% wider than the dorsal image, or one does not, and I do not. I do find it a few centimetres wider, as, no doubt did Ercoline, although quoting him as a supporter without stating whether he agrees with Latendresse (that the widths differ by 35%) or me (that they differ by less than 10%) is a trifle unfair, I think.

Perhaps the simplest is that the cloth was not wrapped around, but draped over the body. Imagine a body lying on a length of cloth on a slab, with a lot of extra cloth beyond the head. If two men stood, head and foot, holding that bit of cloth horizontally between them and lowered it over the body, then the length connecting the top and bottom would be loose, and flop down beyond the top of the head. Another possibility is that the whole body was encased in blocks or bags of spices (100 pounds of myrrh and aloes, perhaps), and the cloth drawn over the blocks around the head.

However, it doesn’t adapt well to an ‘evidence for versus evidence against’ kind of trial, so just consider what follows as a fairly off-th-cuff collection of ideas thrown into the meting pot!The shroud does look like something left behind after something else has gone. I have a piece of Indonesian batik framed on my wall. Although I have no intention of taking it apart, I wonder if, if the covering glass and the batik was removed, there might be some sort of image on the paper backing? The vague appearance of the shroud image owes much to its faintness, its monochromaticity, and its superficiality, all characteristics that could be a result of it being either a backing cloth, or a deliberate transfer experiment of some kind.So what might have been Mark 1, and what happened to it? Perhaps a medieval painting. Might the pigment have remained on the original and the solvent stained the backing? Was it destroyed in the 1532 fire? Destroyed by accident elsewhere? Destroyed deliberately when it was discovered that the ‘backing’ was more ‘realistic’? Or separated from the backing, only to turn up a few years later as the Shroud of Besançon?Or was Mark 1 an original relic, which, as you suggest finally deteriorated to the point of falling part, leaving the backing? Of course that opens the can of worms which even authenticists can’t agree on, namely how the Mark 1 image was made, whether the shroud was wrapped, draped or horizontal over the body, and so on.As for the C-14 date, doubts about its accuracy fall into three general areas. The first suggestion was contamination by oil, paint, smoke, grime, fibres from vestments, a ‘bioplastic’ coating, bacteria, etc. etc. This has largely been discredited even by authenticists; it is clear that all this extraneous gunk would have been completely washed away by the cleaning processes carried out by the labs. The current argument is about the possibility that the sample was actually made of 16th century interpolation, either a patch or a clever reweaving. It would mean that about 70% of the C-14 sample was new, and only 30% original. It’s a sensible idea, but it seems unlikely that such an interpolation would be completely invisible, even after intense scrutiny. The final idea is that the original cloth somehow had its C-14 content changed. Apart from wild speculation, two proper experiments have been carried out. The first did demonstrate that intense neutron radiation can indeed change C-12 to C-14 in a piece of cloth. Whether this was likely as a feature of the resurrection is question of religious faith rather than science. A more realistic experiment, to find out if ‘modern’ carbon monoxide could be incorporated into an ‘ancient’ cloth during an episode of intense heat, thus changing the C-14 proportion, was a complete failure.Finally – the naked Jesus. Well why not? Most medieval paintings of the resurrection show him naked, albeit with the odd wisp of random material to prevent sacrilege. The ‘physics of the supernatural’ is to me a complete oxymoron, but some people speculate. Jesus almost literally exploded in a nuclear blast (mysteriously leaving the rest of Jerusalem intact) and reappeared in a completely different assemblage of matter elsewhere, with or without clothing. Jesus simply miraculously ‘healed,’ woke up, drew aside the bedclothes and walked out (naked or draped in a spare bit of gravecloth). Jesus suddenly dematerialised, leaving a body-shaped vacuum which collapsed with an audible pop, the shroud falling down through the space, and then reappeared elsewhere, in whichever form he chose. All good fun. Other scenarios are possible.That should give you food for thought!","date":"August 20, 2013 at 10:29 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/who-says-the-shroud-is-not-a-scorch-mark-and-more-to-the-point-why/","cat":"permalink","title":"Who says the Shroud is not a scorch mark – and more to the point, WHY?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I see we have moved on quite a lot since Gabriel and latendre replied to my comment, but I cannot let them go unchallenged. Marion used “many” photographs taken in “various lighting conditions and “used PCA” to derive his final results. The filters he used are listed, but whether they were used objectively or specifically to enhance letters which he already assumed were there (having been told what to look for by Marastoni and Coero-Borga), is not clear. There is no indication of where or how any negative results were obtained. The famous three Hebrew letters are bigger than some of his observations (well over 1cm in height), and placed exactly between two of them. It would be interesting to know whether that area was processed. In spite of apparent detail, it would be impossible impartially to replicate his method using this description alone, however well versed one was in using PCA. That is what I call sketchy. If the single set of illustrations leading to PEZw is a good example of a successful process, then I find them unconvincing, and would have liked similar photographs of several of the others for comparison.In order to exclude pareidolia, five criteria are listed for the verification of his inscriptions: “If these five conditions are simultaneously verified, the probability of an artefact becomes very small.” – Remarkably, perhaps, not one of his inscriptions adheres to all five, and all have to be heavily ‘interpreted’ to make any sense of them at all.No doubt Optical Engineering was impressed with the skill with which Marion was able to derive his letters, and perhaps more so by the dexterity with which they were manipulated to reach his conclusions – I’m impressed myself – but in spite of all the science I still find no objective evidence that any of them is actually there at all.","date":"April 17, 2013 at 7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/14/the-making-of-the-hd-image-for-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Making of the HD Image for the Shroud 2.0 App"}],"key_evidence":[{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Big problems for the anti-authenticists:1) The pollen.

However he does not say what Fanti’s mechanical tests were (and the press released mentioned “a set of mechanical parameters”) or how they were calibrated to achieve the single date; and he (Rinaldi) does not discuss the spectrographic results at all, which presumably postulate chemical rather than physical degradation.Given the almost universal derision which Fanti’s book has received, I fear the chances of it being published in English are getting remoter by the minute, which I think is a pity.

On my laptop (Macbook Pro), this only occurs if I hold the screen in ‘landscape’ format, and not when I hold it sideways in ‘portrait’ format. I suppose it is something to do with the way the liquid crystal display units are arranged. Although a solarization has many of the characteristics of a negative, it isn’t, nor is it anything to do with infra-red radiation, as suggested on Vicenzo’s website.Almost nothing in Vincenzo’s article above is true. Angular Filming does not act as a negative/positive inverter, it does not enhance detail, nor allow for close up magnification. It is a very poor filter system. Angular filming does not work in segments, it depends entirely on the angle between the screen and the camera, although, as a camera is more precise than the human eye, you do need several positions to take photos of the whole screen. The Wikipedia image is not the best image of the Vatican Veronica on the internet. Try http://www.holyfacedevotion.com/images/VeronicaVeil.jpg.As for the similarity between the faces of the Shroud and the Vatican veil, you don’t need to squint at a badly focussed solarisation of either to observe them. Just superimpose the two on a document. Hardly surprisingly, the eyes, nose and mouth can be fairly accurately superimposed on one another – but then that’s true of just about every other portrait on the planet. I do not see any other correlation, specifically no injury marks on the cheeks. The conclusion that the Veronica will authenticate the Shroud of Turin and vice versa is extremely far-fetched, in my opinion.

I agree that the the finel version of the papal bull was much less antagonistic towards the shroud, and by implication its owner than the previous ones. I’m afraid I cannot go along with your suggestion that the phrase ‘omne fraude cessante’ can be reduced to a formulaic expression of general good faith, but do agree that the second part of the sentence (ut tanquam…) is indeed couched in somewhat legalistic jargon (especially with all those predictam, dicti and diciturs!).So did Antipope Clement think the Shroud was authentic or not? I think he had no idea. While any bit of bone or cloth might be considered a genuine relic in its local environment, partly out of loyalty to its area and partly for lack of anything else to compare it to, the hierarchy in the Vatican (or Avignon in this case) must have realised that there were dozens of conflicting, and sometimes impossible, relics scattered around Europe, many or most of which could not be authentic, and were at best pious representations and at worst deliberate frauds. I do not think consideration for the irregularities of the Fourth Crusade were much of a consideration; at the time these things were considered ‘rescued’ rather than ‘robbed’ I think, but the seniority of the place where the relic was displayed may have played a part in making a decision. A humble parish priest suddenly announcing he had a nail from the cross could have been denounced out of hand, while a bishop might have been accorded considerably more respect. A conflict of interests between two important men over the Shroud had to be handled very delicately. Various middle paths were possible: the shroud was authentic, but couldn’t be displayed; the shroud was not authentic, but could be displayed; or the pope didn’t know whether it was authentic or not. The last, ignorance, would have shown a hierarchical weakness an antipope would have wanted to avoid, and the first would have rendered the relic useless (practical things, relics). The second, I think, was the best compromise the pope could come up with.Two questions arise; why would one grant an indulgence to someone who visited a painting? and why was the bishop enjoined to perpetual silence on the matter?The first is easy. An act of veneration is made to God, not to an artifact, miraculous or not, and indulgence is granted to a person, not a thing. The visiting of a holy place, whether or not it contained a relic, could be considered sufficient devotion for an indulgence to be awarded.The second is less easy. My guess is that, being personally hostile to the de Charney family, d’Arcis had another go at the Pope, who now felt that his authority was being attacked and who felt that he had already made as good a compromise as necessary.As to whether the Shroud is really authentic or not, I don’t think any of this correspondence sheds any light on the matter at all!","date":"October 24, 2014 at 6:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Ah.

B) and C) the other thirds to Oxford and Zurich.7) Weigh each piece carefully, but do not record which way up the pieces were when they were cut, or from which end each lab’s piece came, so that it is almost impossible to decide later who got what from where…A) 1) Tucson reserves its little sliver and cuts its bigger piece in two, reserving one of these ‘halves’.2) Cut the remaining piece in four. Convert these four pieces into carbon pellets.3) Test each carbon pellet twice to achieve BP dates.B) 1) Oxford cuts its piece into three, and converts them all into carbon pellets.2) Test each pellet six times to achieve BP dates.C) (Much less certain about this). 1) Zurich cuts its piece in two.2) One bit is subdivided into three, and each piece converted into carbon pellets for dating (how many times?)3) The other bit is divided into two (or three and one bit kept back?) and these two bits conveyed into carbon pellets for dating (how many times?).So, Tucson still have the “little sliver” and the “reserved half” of its other piece.

So far, terrific! The brown stain spread out a little and looked just the colour of dried blood, and, what a surprise, a yellow ‘serum’ spread out beyond the brown stain, exactly like a wound exudate on an injury-dressing. Very exciting. After it had dried – and would you believe it did the clot retraction thing to perfection, leaving a thicker rim and and a thinner middle – I looked at it with a UV light. Tragedy. The brown stain did not fluoresce, but the ‘serum’ ring did – bright pink! (Most unlike the alleged serum rings around some blood areas on the shroud.) Back to the drawing board. Still, I then washed my paint drips thoroughly, and the dark brown “blood” was washed away, leaving a much redder, but lighter, therefore pinkish stain. The yellow ‘serum’ ring is a little lighter, but still yellow. The whole thing now fluoresces pinkly as well.I do not know if the pink fluorescence is long lasting, but if the C-14 sample corner fluoresces pink, then Rogers’s madder ideas may be better supported.

Take this farrago; “Actually what is mostly needed is an alkaline solution in terms of remoistened human lactic acid and/or Jerusalem limestone dust mixed with rainwater and/or Red Heifer ashes mixed with living waters + (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation = pre- or light mordanting conditions on Second Temple period burial (basic archeological chemistry).” Now suppose I was brave enough to say that I think you’re completely wrong. Suppose I were to suggest that none of the conditions you describe were likely to have been present at the burial of Christ, and that even if they were, they would not have had the effect of producing an image. Suppose I did that, what would be your response? Would it be a list of sources showing that you are in fact correct, or would you simply call me an idiot for not believing you? Why should I?Later, you do give two references: 2 Chronicles 16:14.  “They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer’s art, and they made a very great fire in his honour.”That’s it? That’s a source for all your detailed descriptions of the wrappings and smearings and fumigations? Well, it’s not good enough, Max. It is a basis for an imaginative reconstruction, not a source for a factual one.And then there’s: Ket. 8b; M. Ḳ. 27b. “At first the carrying out of the dead was harder for his relatives than his death, so that they left him and ran away, until Rabban Gamaliel came and adopted a simple style and they carried him out in garments of linen, and [then] all the people followed his example and carried out [the dead] in garments of linen. Said R. Papa: And now it is the general practice [to carry out the dead] even in rough cloth worth [only] a zuz.” What does this tell us about Jesus’s burial? That he must have been buried in elaborate wrappings? Surely not, because you also say that in ancient practice, either “comely” or “rich” shrouds were used.So, no, Max, don’t go on and on about how badly you are misrepresented. Don’t “repeat endlessly,” don’t say “most probably” or tell us what you think Jewish burial practices were. If the halakha supports your ideas, then quote it. If the Talmud or the bible support your ideas, quote them. If physics or chemistry support your ideas, show us how.And finally: “since the end of 2011, I can convincingly demonstrate Pilate coins were really placed over the TS man’s eyes by means of an eidomatic reading grid based on archaeological bloodstain pattern analysis.” I bet you can’t.","date":"August 1, 2015 at 4:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/31/cherry-jam-the-metaphor/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Cherry Jam, the Metaphor"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Max, I do understand how frustrated you must feel when your own version of the image formation of the Shroud has received little critical appraisal (when, in YOHO it far surpasses anyone else’s), while Colin’s version has received a lot of attention.

I have devoted several posts to explaining that “no one knows how it was done” is not an argument against a 13th century origin, but it is equally not an argument against authenticity either.

Your sole contribution to ‘how the image got there’ is “images are always created by human beings and no one has been able to explain how a corpse could produce such a detailed blood-stained image on that large piece of linen,” which I have already commented on above.“The reviewer is saying there is a “stockpile” of evidence for authenticity. This is pseudoscience because there is no evidence for authenticity.” In the absence of common consensus, evidence may be brought forward to defend either interpretation of the Shroud, and there is indeed sufficient evidence for authenticity for the term ‘stockpile’ to be valid (if somewhat bizarre). Even if there were not, the statement would simply be false; it is not pseudoscience. And should the Shroud ever be definitively determined to be a fake, then the contrary evidence will still exist; it will just have to be re-interpreted.“The reviewer then goes on to assume that the TS is authentic and indicates that this is evidence for the “resurrection of Jesus” because the TS was not destroyed.” No, he doesn’t. He specifically conditionally says “provided the [authenticity hypothesis] is assumed,” then there is a priori evidence that the Shroud’s occupant did not lie in it for very long, which is evidence – not very strong, but evidence nonetheless – for the Resurrection.“It is obvious to me that the reviewer is practicing pseudoscience to promote belief in life after death.” What is obvious to you is not necessarily what is obvious to anybody else. It may well be that the reviewer believes that the Shroud is real evidence for the Resurrection, but he is careful not to say that, and one should not assume unstated beliefs. Even if he does believe it, you cannot demonstrate that his belief derives from the practice of pseudoscience. Your subsequent comment on ID is wholly irrelevant.Next you quote a passage from the reviewer without comment. Why?

Donna Campbell, the textile expert, says tentatively: “There are signs in the Shroud sample that direct the notion of mending or reweaving of the actual woven fabric,” which is hardly conclusive. Donna Campbell also points out the irregularity of the thread spacing in the sample she examined, but rightly attributes this to “the collapse of the yarns at the cut edge.” She also notices a black ‘thread’ which is in fact scarcely thicker than one of the fibres of the linen, which could have been used in stitching. And so it could, and probably was.

There is a long and worthy tradition of “what if” speculation, in science and in various other disciplines, in which the axioms upon which a hypothesis is based are not all rooted either in observation or logic.What if animals could talk? What if Napoleon had succeeded in invaded Britain, or Japan had never attacked Pearl Harbour? What if light travelled at the same speed as sound? Scientists and historians have enjoyed developing interesting and sometimes useful scenarios based on these ideas, knowing full well that the premises were wholly unsubstantiated.One of Jackson’s axioms is that a body can become instantaneously mechanically transparent. From that, and the rest of his postulates, Jackson has built a reasonable scenario which, according to his ‘new physics’, could produce an image exactly as seen on the Shroud. The scenario is controversial. To suggest that the axioms upon which it is based are controversial – is silly. Even Jackson knows very well that there is no known physics on which such a predicate could be based, although he desperately hopes that, simply because science has occasionally been wrong before, something may turn up to justify it eventually.“As a physicist, I admit to having my own difficulties with this concept … [but] … I would like to ask the reader to put aside, for the moment, any reservations he or she might have concerning the “unconventional” nature of this concept and consider it merely as a hypothesis to be evaluated critically using the well established principles of the Scientific Method.”Well, fair enough.","date":"November 18, 2015 at 9:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“Jackson does not believe a vacuum was created.”But he does believe that a body became ‘mechanically transparent’.

Did the mechanically transparent Jesus become solid again, get up, push the stone away and walk out? Or did he mechanically transparently walk through the stone and resolidify outside? And where did he get his new clothes from?

No one could look at the Manopello image, with its somewhat grotesque teeth, or the slicked back hair and sleek moustache of the Pantocrator, and say, ‘he looks like the man on the Shroud.’ I do not consider the mathematical similarity more important than the overall artistic one.2) When I match up a couple of photos, I do not use the size of the head. It is impossible to gauge the size of the Shroud man’s head as his beard obscures his chin. What I do is to adjust one picture (without changing the aspect) so that the level of the eyes and the level of the mouth match, as I have in my picture above. When that is done almost any picture of anybody blends quite well, including Prince William.3) Your own matches of the Manopello and Pantocrator images do not match mouths well. For the Manopello image, we have to assume that what is normally taken as the lower lip of the Shroud man is actually the teeth of the Manopello man, while the lower lip of the Pantocrator image is actually the moustache of the Shroud man. Comparing the Manopello image with the Pantocrator image, following your own video, shows the mouths of the two are widely discrepant.4) At 4:08 we are told “there is no way your going to get all these match points by random happenstance” and at 4:20 we get “the calculated odds of probability and chance that all these 180 points of congruency between the Shroud of Turin and this image [the Pantocrator] are a coincidental match … are 1 in several million at least.” Actually the video shows almost no points of congruency, let alone 180. You would have to point them out individually before anybody could accept any such thing. How did you count them? Simply lining up the eyes does not show 180 points of congruency.5) There is also a claim (at 1:35) that the Manopello image must have been laid against the Shroud image for the match to be so perfect. However resizing photographs to fit each other does not support any such claim. To do that you would have to produce actual measurements of similar features of the two images, which has not been done, either here or, I believe, anywhere else.All in all, its an entertaining game, this image blending demonstration, but it tells us nothing at all about the origins of the various images, let alone constitutes any kind of ‘proof.’","date":"March 26, 2015 at 3:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"So…Article I.1.0 The front and back images are equally dark.

I do not doubt Dayvault’s sincerity. However I have a couple of serious objections to the ENCODED article.Firstly, I do wish the word ‘forensic’ didn’t keep cropping up. I have no doubt at all – does anyone else? Does Dayvault? – that a court of law (which is where forensic methods get tested) would have extreme difficulty in recognising, beyond all reasonable doubt, that either the Sanliurfa mosaic or the Cistine Chapel were copies of the shroud. The forensic methods of a fingerprint expert, for example, or those of a firearms/toolmarks unit, in which Dayvault gained his expertise, are to demonstrate specific points of congruence between two images that appear very similar from the start. Any demonstration, by an opposing barrister, of lack of congruence where there should be some, usually invalidates the finding completely. Sadly, the images in dispute look nothing like each other, and all attempts to make them do so by finding points of congruence – which are in themselves highly debatable – are, forensically, doomed to fail.Secondly, Dayvault makes (at least) two assertions which are demonstrably untrue by anyone with basic imaging software, namely:     “The ONLY photograph which accurately and forensically corresponds to the unique landmark features of the frescoes is the highly-detailed CDD shroud face image” and     “In an attempt to disprove the hypothesis, overlay the Chapel fresco with another scaled photo of another person. try your best to align them. (An observable exercise is futility.)”This last was the stimulus behind my first ‘try-it-yourself’ comment above. I maintain that my own face has at least as many points of congruence with the Chapel as that of the shroud, and would be happy to defend that position with detailed illustrations.Thirdly, and I admit that this might just be my own prejudice, but I’m not impressed by the fact that a number of nations have forensic science departments, and do not think that mentioning the ‘FBI, DHS Customs and Border Protection, New York City Police Department, Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department…. Australian Federal Police… ‘ etc, etc. lends any authority to the article. At least to me, this sort of thing actually damages, rather than enhances, its credibility.Finally, like many researchers into offbeat matters, I should be delighted to change my mind if better evidence could be adduced.

Another lamentation, painted ten years later, also shows these criss-crosses, although the Shroud is not transparent. Before, between and after these paintings Fra Angelico painted a couple of dozen figures of Christ, on the cross and off it, and there are very few consistent elements. The criss-crosses may be present or not, blood from the side-wound may be spurting or a mere dribble, and the length of beard and style of moustache is variable. The hands are invariably nailed through the palms, from which blood dribbles down the underside of the arms as well as straight off, and the feet fastened with one nail, and Christ wears a crown of thorns.

I have the 26 page “Correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with the 3-D structure of a human body shape” before me, specifically the graph labelled Figure 2. For those not familiar with Jumper and Jackson’s remarkably inventive technique, this is what they did. They photographed the head of a man lying on the ground from the side, with and without a cloth draped over it. By superimposing the two photographs, the vertical distance between the two outlines could be measured. As it is difficult to identify most of the body parts with sufficient specificity, data from 13 places on the real head was compared with intensity data from 13 equivalent places on the shroud. Figure 2 shows the relationship. Being good scientists, they find that although the null hypothesis (that there is no correlation between image intensity and cloth-body distance) can be rejected, very little can be confidently asserted about what the relationship is. (The perfect match” quoted by daveb has, like so many derivations from original papers, become part of shroud dogma, but is in fact wholly fictitious.) They might have refined their calculations by omitting three, closely-spaced results which appear to me to be outliers, but, being good scientists, they didn’t.These 13 cloth-body measurements, of 13 points on the head, provide the whole rationale for every subsequent attempt to read three-dimensional information from the shroud. And it works astonishingly well. Jumper and Jackson’s further investigations take the correlation as read, and devote the rest of their time to deforming the whole body image derived from it (which they find very unconvincing as is) until it matches the observed profile of a prone volunteer, thus establishing a theoretical cloth shape which looks entirely convincing. Other investigations using the same idea demonstrate that the cloth is more flexible along the warp than the weft, rather like, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, unrolling a carpet or a Venetian blind over a body.The most important point about all this is that the cloth-body measurements that work so well were all made vertically (indeed, how could they not be, from a face?), not perpendicularly to either body or cloth, which fact has interesting ramifications for ideas about gas diffusion and minimum distance, among others.","date":"February 2, 2013 at 9:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/01/gripping-comment-promoted-thus-expanding-teaser-of-the-day-2/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","title":"Gripping Comment Promoted thus expanding Teaser of the Day #2"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I notice that shreds of John Paul II’s clothing are on sale for about $15, and numbers of chapels have drops of his blood, although none of that is for sale that I can find.

He suggests an X-ray spectrographic analysis of three small areas. If titanium is found in quantity, he thinks his hypothesis is well founded. if not, not.

It is often stated that the dorsal image represents a taller man than the ventral image (which should be the other way round if the back of the cloth was flat on a ledge and the front was draped over a figure. Isabel Piczek thinks that the front legs are too short, and attributes this to the fact that they were bent, with the knees well off the group, in which case there should be no image of the back of the legs on the cloth. Some people think that the shoulders look dislocated, to account for the fact that the hands can hide the genitals, whir others think that the shoulders were slightly raised to account for this. Rigor mortis, lying on a stone pillow, even floating above the surface of the tomb, all these have been suggested by authenticists to account for what they see as patently inaccurate anatomical details. John’s simple faith in anatomical perfection, in short, doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.Heller and Adler were very brilliant and accomplished scientists in their fields, and their lack of imagination about how the details of the shroud could be reproduced should not be held against them, but to treat their artistic speculations as the last word on the matter is absurd.I don’t know anyone who is searching frantically for an explanation of how the shroud appeared on the shroud. I know of several who have calmly investigated a variety of hypotheses, presented their findings for discussion, and either refined their line of thought or embarked on new ones. The image on the shroud appears to be unique among images; any explanation for it, regardless of provenance, is fanciful until it is considered established.What on earth is all that stuff about Christ’s crucifixion got to do with it?

St Paul, I believe, stated that if Christ did not rise from the dead than our faith is in vain.” Dead right. I am endlessly quoting St Augustine of Hippo, St Thomas Aquinas, Pope John-Paul II’s ‘Fides et Ratio’ and Benedict XVI’s address at Regensburg. However, the genuineness of the shroud has no bearing on my faith in the resurrection, and I don’t believe it has on yours. If it were proved a fake tomorrow, would you convert? What to?Matthias: “There is just no issue there. I struggle to see anatomical abnormalities.” Apparently, so does John, but you are in a minority. Shroud/body configuration theories abound in order to correct percieved abnormalities. Just one point though – when you lie flat on the ground with your wrists crossed, what angle do they make? You’ll notice that the shroud man’s arms are very bent at the elbow, and meet at quite a wide angle at the wrists. Can you copy that?OK. Your measurements are impeccable. Why so many people disagree with them is beyond me. But they do. Piczek thinks that both the top and bottom of the shroud were horizontal, and the shortness of the legs is due to the foreshortening that comes from projecting the bent legs vertically upwards and downwards. If the cloth were tied under the knees, then there should be a non-image band on both ventral and dorsal images, and there should be considerable lengthening of the upper legs as the cloth passes over the knees. And all that projection business – of course I understand. All the suggested radiation directions and cloth configurations are attempts to show how “anatomical perfection” would look when it appeared on a cloth. The trouble is, as I said before, that each of these possibilites has its adherents, all of whom think that the others’ versions are completely untenable, and would result in a distorted appearance. W says the legs are too short, and therefore must be the result of foreshortening; X says the arms are too long, and therefore must be the result of dislocation; Y says the neck is too short, and therefore must be the result of the head being on a pillow; Z says the buttocks are too rounded, and therefore must be the result of the body hovering in the air. All of them begin with the assumption that the shroud image is not, in itself, anatomical perfection, but a projection thereof. Trouble is, none of them agree how to achieve it.John: I think you’re correct in thinking that a body set rigidly in the position of a crucified person, whose arms were pulled out of position with some force to their site over the abdomen, is now fairly well accepted by authenticists.

I have now examined Dr Diaz’s paper in detail, and those of his observations which are true are very simplistic, and those which are scientifically complex are not supported by evidence. Trying to understand how the connection came to be made leads me to guess that because chaotic cell growth sometimes produces blobs that loosely resemble embryos, and because some vaguely embryo-like shapes can be seen in the burn marks of the shroud, there must be some connection. No such connection is established.Section 1 is devoted to the observation of embryo-like shapes observed in irregular cellular masses. They range from the shape of a very early embryo with no observable limbs to an almost fully formed looking fetus with well defined wrists and ankles. In only one picture is there any evidence of an umbilical cord. So far, so unsurprising. These shapes could be found in any random assemblage of blobs. In spite of considerable care in discovering and photographing these shapes, there is no suggestion that they are, in fact, anything more than that. No evidence of spine, brain, bone or any organs is attested. Although some of the pictures shows a dark spot on the “head,” others show spots dotted around the body, and random separations and smudges. Section 2 is devoted to materials (photos of the shroud) and methods (attempting to match shapes on the shroud to “prior morphological visualisation” – start with a vague shape and try to match it somewhere). It is a very short section and does not explain what the prior morphological visualisations were or how they were matched to shapes on the shroud.Section 3 begins: “In horizontal position by extracting the central man that appears in the front image, we identify dark emission of central 10 -12 spectral lines.” This is nonsense. No evidence is shown of how the ‘central man’ was ‘extracted.’ If he was, and it is possible, then we could be left with the famous ‘bands’ which are usually explained as artefacts of the random distribution of different darknesses of the hanks of warp threads in the cloth. The term ‘spectral lines’ is genuinely meaningless in this context.The next sentence is: “These spectral lines evince narrow alignment that delimiting head area and undergoes a curve, broadening at level of the lower extremities, this signify that some type of photon source energy its generate in the brain and decay slowly at distal level.” This is illustrated by a picture of the shroud, with 7 longitudinal lines sketched in stretching from wrists to ankles, spaced sufficiently widely to touch the patches on both sides, and 7 more from the top of the head to the stomach, closely spaced so that they fit within the frame of the hair. Allowing from translational difficulties, this appears to mean that Diaz observed dark lines radiating from the brain and widening out towards the feet. This observation is not illustrated in the paper, and the illustration which does accompany it does not show anything of the kind.Now the paper takes off into wild speculation without any evidence at all, and in direct contradiction to every previous observation or explanation of the shroud, whether for or against authenticity. “Outside the main body man image there is no evidence of these spectral lines.” This is simply not true, as a glance at shroudscope will verify. “The spectral lines generate a hexagonal pattern.” This is also not true, as a glance at the paper’s own accompanying illustration will verify. “Other chiral pattern are identified in terms of helicity waves.” This is an attempt to turn the outlines of the big water stains into wave pattern, which is explained in the caption to an accompanying illustration as due to “electromagnetic field wave polarisation.”Need I go on? After finding some vaguely embryo-like shapes, Figure 18 compares them to a couple of fully formed foetuses, complete with fingers and toes.It really won’t do.","date":"October 14, 2013 at 5:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-a-peer-reviewed-scientific-journal/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"In a peer-reviewed scientific journal"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m sorry Dr Diaz, but your explanation is still hopelessly unscientific and in most cases meaningless. I won’t comment on your medical observations, except that for a scientist to say something like: “Light and magnetism are reflections of the same substance,” in an introduction to some form of “Collision Event” theory is a disappointing start. There is no sense in which either light or magnetism are substances, nor in which they are reflections of any substance or each other. You go on to suggest that you made a model of light discharge over “lines of electrical conductance structured in helicoidal patterns.” If this means anything, it means flashing a lamp over some twisted wires carrying electric current. A diagram of your apparatus would seem to be a basic, even minimal requirement.But no matter, I am happy to leave you to your cancer cells. What you can’t get away with is your description of, and deductions from, the shroud. The core of your argument begins: “please observe the patches ,….. what pattern has the patches? Easy …. Triangular pattern …. Observe the organization of these triangular patterns , its is random ? … not . ..it is organized in chiral patterns that its mirror images,,, can purely fire make this spatial order …?? Not.” You go on later to say: “scientists who have analyzed so far have focused exclusively in the shroud man image without placing attention un the patterns that appear around the main image.” This is simply not true, although it is possible that you have not read the articles by Aldo Guerreschi and Michele Salcito (at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo3.pdf and http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo4.pdf) which comprehensively demonstrate how these marks, and the pattern they make, could have arisen without any need for the “piezoelectric activity of collagen.”The whole of the rest of your paper seems to be based on the idea that all the patched holes appeared more or less independently of each other, with the shroud opened out. Some very confused ideas about chirality, reflection, piezoelectric effects, electromagnetic, helicoidal waves and quantum entanglement are adduced to explain what would indeed be a remarkable event, if it were not entirely adequately explained by folding the shroud up and sticking a hot bar through it.This having been done, some water appears to have been poured through the damage, creating clear, dark rimmed stains just above each burn hole. These you liken to the heads of twin foetuses, and the area below them, which has no definition but is fortuitously bordered by burns and scorches, to their aborted bodies.

I had occasion, a few days ago to criticise a ‘comparison’ between the work of Walter McCrone and Heller & Adler, because although it was a reasonable analysis of the STuRP scientists, it said virtually nothing about McCrone. Here, I was expecting something to justify the blurb: “This talk explores the tension between scientific fact and religious faith in the identification and verification of a sacred relic.” and “Some of the conclusions drawn from that study [the STuRP expedition], and the absence or presence of scientific evidence for those conclusions, has led to perhaps the quintessential conflict between acceptance of the validity and veracity of the scientific method on the one hand, and religious belief and faith on the other.” But no. After a few interesting comments about good and bad science, Joel Bernstein merely recounted, sometimes word for word, Walter McCrone’s account, in ‘Judgement Day for the Turin Shroud’ of how he investigated the Shroud and the conclusions he drew from it. There was not a single mention of any other findings by any other scientist, let alone anything to dissent from McCrone’s painting hypothesis.Bernstein did recall Carl Sagan’s ‘Baloney Detecting Kit’, whose second tenet is ‘Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgable proponents of all points of view,’ but no alternative points of view, let alone debate, were even suggested, let alone debated. Another tenet is ‘Can others duplicate the experiment and get the same result?’ Bernstein seemed unaware that others had indeed duplicated the experiment (examining the fibres), but got a different result.In the question and answer session at the end, one of the audience asked if there were any chance of the radiocarbon dating being repeated, to which Bernstein’s reply (verbatim – see 1:12:06) was: “I recently saw another paper – they didn’t re-date it but they checked all the data of those three institutions and came up with the conclusion there were no errors, the sampling was correct, and all that was perfectly legitimate.” I do not believe this is true.I have no reason to suppose that Bernstein is particularly interested in the Shroud for itself, and he is correct that it provides an excellent focus for a debate, or a lecture, on the dichotomy between scientific fact and religious faith.

Why this should be I’m not sure – possibly because ‘Science’ trumped ‘Art’ when it came to authority in those days, and the scientists involved in the Shroud showed little evidence of knowing much about painting. There was much talk of ‘a painting would seep through the cloth and be visible on the back’ and ‘a painting always shows the directionality of brush strokes’ and ‘a painting always has shadows which show where the light was coming from’ and even, ‘a painting always has outlines,’ all of which seem rather naive, and fairly obviously to anybody who’d actually visited an art gallery, simply untrue.They were on better ground in the search for pigment, although even here, they did not really know how much pigment could be sufficient, so that their arguments were not about whether there were any iron oxide particles, but whether there were enough to create an image. McCrone thought there were, and produced at least one experiment which appeared to demonstrate it. I do not know if it was challenged by any counter-experiments showing the opposite.The scientists were on even better ground in their search for a colourless binder that would hold the pigment to the cloth. This, it could be reasoned, might remain even when most of the pigment had rubbed (or been washed) off. According to STuRP (Schwalbe & Rogers), McCrone’s chemical test for a proteinaceous binder (amido black) shows positive for any linen and could not have identified anything on top of it, while their own tests were more specific and definitely ruled out any protein on the image area. However they also ruled out any possibility of starch being the binder, a finding that was later retracted by Rogers, who decided he could find some after all. This suppported his ‘starch and saponin’ surface layer hypothesis, but could also support McCrone in his search for a binder.Even lower, as it were, than the binder, would be any chemical deterioration of the cloth itself, caused by pigment, binder, or carrier, all of which had disappeared. Guarlaschelli’s painting hypothesis depends on this, I think, and chemically, has not been demonstrated to be untenable.So, no, the painting hypothesis has not definitely been ruled out.","date":"September 24, 2014 at 3:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/21/lest-the-wrath-of-god-descend-upon-them-like-a-ton-of-bricks/","cat":"humor","title":"Lest the wrath of God descend upon them like a ton of bricks"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"You say TOM-AH-TOES, I say TOM-AY-TOES; let’s agree they sound exactly the same…In a recent conversation at Shroud Science, Giulio Fanti expressed his belief that the entire radiocarbon sample was from the date determined by the laboratories (1300 or so), without any contamination, but was part of a larger patch, the borders of which have yet to be determined.

Thus the sides of the cheeks appear to be cut off by a clear vertical edge, when in fact they are not so well defined; they just appear so because of the weave.

Three references to the “traditional” horizontal position of the arms led me to believe the setting up of a straw man, but I think I was mistaken. Attempts to get blood to flow down an arm were made from three different ‘exit wound’ sites, at angles from “0° (arm parallel to the groud and perpendicular to the body) to 90° (vertical arm).” It was found that blood would only flow down the arm at “greater than 80°” which is, indeed, a good deal more vertical than any “traditional” position.The idea that there were two blood flow angles, as illustrated above, was explored many years ago. The zigzag pattern was created, it was suggested, by blood flowing vertically down the arm and stopping in minor clots along the way, which, when the arm was more horizontal, then changed direction and dripped straight off. This was quite ingenious, and I experimented with it myself twenty years ago, but was wholly unable to produce anything like the pattern we see on the Shroud. The fact that in all this time nobody has reported success suggests that either the experiment has continuously failed, or that the researches of Garlaschelli and Borrini are long overdue.Mike’s suggestion, that the blood would flow along the sloping arm if the flow was slow, or vertically off it if the flow was faster, also needs experimental corroboration.The authors do state that “further analysis will focus on the position of both arms…” so I don’t think the right arm has been wholly ignored.

I arbitrarily decided to match the bloodstains of the back of the head to the line of the eyebrows. The image of the deltoids roughly matches the image of the pectorals, and the blood trickle across the back is level with the elbows on the front. The big bloodstain (on the instep?) at the end of the ventral legs then appears more or less in the middle of the big footprint at the end of the dorsal legs. If we make a fold in the dorsal image, then either the ‘back of head’ bloodstains end up match up with the moustache, or the ‘instep’ stain now ends up matching the ‘toes’ end of the ‘footprint.’ Lesser distortion but at both ends simultaneously is also possible.If the man on the shroud had bent legs, then, of course, the front image (the cloth following his contours) should end up significantly longer than the dorsal image (the cloth being flat), but in that case it is difficult to explain how the back of his calves could have left a mark. Sorry, Chris, I was dragging in various comments from earlier postings for my comment about Dan’s iPad photo.(a) comes from the Gilberts’ spectroscopy paper which has a diagram of the reflectance spectrum of exactly this bloodstain.(b) comes from Miller and Pellicori’s UV paper which has a photograph of this bloodstain under UV light with no fluorescent serum rim.(c) and (d) are apparent just by looking at Dan’s posting.I dare say I often appear a bit round the bend anyway, but my observations are nearly always based on reports of primary observations.

However, shorter wavelengths may get scattered, so that there are fewer to detect, which is why the sun looks redder in the evening. Reflectance spectra would not be affected. A whiter backing cloth would reflect more of all wavelengths, but the overall shape of the spectrum would not be affected, I think.As to the red spike, it puzzles me enormously. From the spectra I have found on the internet, it seems that ‘red’ minerals reflect little visible light from roughly 400-500nm, and lots from 600-700nm. The shape of their spectra is basically a step. ‘Brown’ things have a spectrum which slopes gradually from little at low wavelengths to lots at high wavelengths. Green and blue minerals have reflectance spectra that look like hills at around about their appropriate frequencies, but nothing is typified by a spike. Spikes do appear in the spectra of biological material, such as various algae, but I imagine that that sort of material would degrade quite quickly, and cannot think of anything (a lichen perhaps?) with a stable red colour.It beats me, then.

They do look fainter than their front side equivalents, but the photos are not good enough to say much more than that. There is, as far as I can see, no image at all on the back side, although this is in direct contradiction to Fr Rinaldi’s 1934 observation that there was. Perhaps he was only referring to the bloodstains.I’m interested in Colin’s (and my) observation that “Most of the original blood has probably flaked off, leaving just a pinkish coloration.” Looking at individual ribs of thread, it seems to me that while some of them have indeed retained a ‘pinkish colouration,’ some of them seem to be the same colour as the off-bloodstain threads. None of them seem to be lighter than the off-bloodstain threads. Since all the off-bloodstain threads are image threads, and not only that, but particularly dark image threads (being on the prominent brow), this suggests that the base colour of the shroud under the bloodstains is the same as the un-bloodstained image areas – in other words that the darkening of the shroud due to image-formation occurred before the application of the bloodstains.","date":"April 14, 2013 at 5:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well, the good thing about those early papers is that they are quite easily understandable. When we look at a patch of cloth and say it’s green, and then look at its spectrum and see a big reflectance hill around 543nm, that’s easy to understand. That’s why I like reflectance spectra better than absorbance. However, we could see its spectrum and see nothing in the ‘green’ range, but twin spikes in the blue and yellow. A patch of cloth made of alternating blue and yellow threads looks green, but if we examined individual threads, we wouldn’t see green at all, but blue or yellow. (I actually know this because our school uniform skirts are made of a blue and yellow tartan, which looks green at a distance).Now if, for example, the shroud linen threads consisted of, say, 90% yellow fibres and 10% bright red ones, then we might see that anomalous spike in the spectrum, and be able to resolve it by looking more closely at the individual fibres. However, when we found these bright red fibres (or paint flakes, or whatever they might be) they would still have to be made of a material with a distinctly ‘spiky’ spectrum, which so far I can’t identify.As for identifying individual spectra of layers of different colours, that would be a bit of a poser. However, by overlaying a transmission spectrum (light shining from behind) and a reflectance spectrum (from above), you might be able to identify wavelengths of light absorbed by the material underneath, and thus deduce something about its colour. So a twin layer of red and green would look red by reflected light, but black if you tried to shine a light through it, showing that there was an absorption of the red by the layer beneath it. If the spectra of the two layers were individually quite irregular patterns (such as those of blood and cloth), then subtracting the one from the other might enable you to derive the colour of the hidden material. Maybe an expert in authenticating paintings would have some ideas along those lines?","date":"April 13, 2013 at 12:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"We are the peers, Paulette, you and me and Oskar and Andrea and Yannick and Max and everybody called David and all the rest.

It was not “silly” to believe that the Besançon shroud was the genuine shroud even though it looked obviously like a painting; being miraculous, it could have looked like anything.

My own view is that the Turin Shroud was more ‘realistic’ than the Besançon one, but that was not really my point, which was that a relic did not have to look realistic to be accepted as genuine, it only had to have official sanction. Whether or not the revolutionaries really found a 200 year-old stencil, the fact that they said they had was sufficient to discredit the Besançon shroud which has been accepted as genuine by saints and pilgrims for two hundred years.I have read Bergier carefully, and am intrigued as to why he particularly wanted to discredit the Besançon shroud, but was not particularly interested in supporting or denying all the other shrouds he knew. He says the the Turin shroud better represents the sort of cloth that might wrap a dead body, but does’t go so far as to say he thinks it, or any of the others, genuine.

My mention of the Lier copy was to establish that the Shroud of Turin did not look like Chifflet’s depiction of it.However, it is clear that Bergier did not believe that any of the shrouds were genuine, and that they had all been manufactured for religious ceremonies. It is also notable that he recognises that shrouds used for this ceremony had the image of Christ on them. This is exactly Charles Freeman’s belief as well.I’m not sure how secure is Dorothy’s Crispino’s assertion that the Besançon shroud was actually created as a prop for the 1523 exposition. If you have a text for this it would be useful. She says that on “March 27, the chapter made a formal decision that ‘the shroud’ should be secured in a chest with three locks and three keys.” I find that strange, for a ‘theatrical prop.’ She goes on to say that “Paul de Gail sees in this event the recent acquisition by the church of what came to be called the Besançon shroud.” The word acquisition is significant. Acquired from where? From an artist’s studio? Or from some other source? Although it was clearly used in the Quem Quaeritis ceremony, it was obviously given some considerable veneration, possibly, as Dorothy guesses, because it had been touched to the true shroud elsewhere, or possibly because it was much older and had some more respectable provenance. Only ten years later (1535) we are told: “thirty thousand pilgrims came to the city of Doubs on the day of an exposition.” To leap from recently painted stage prop to authentic shroud of Christ in ten years is a remarkable feat of commercial marketing.","date":"January 19, 2015 at 3:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/17/ponderable-for-today/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Ponderable for Today"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"In fact, we find in Bergier’s “Dictionnaire de Théologie” (Volume 7), that he didn’t believe any of the Shrouds were genuine.

Ces linceuls ou suaires conservés dans les trésors des églises, pour qu’ils servissent toujours au même usage, ont été pris dans la suite pour des linges qui avoient servi à la sépulture de notre Sauveur; voilà pourquoi il s’en trouve dans plusieurs églises différentes, à Cologne, à Besançon, à Turin, à Brioude, etc.; et l’on s’est persuadé qu’ils avoient été apportés de la Palestine dans le temps des croisades.“Il ne s’ensuit point de là que ces suaires ne méritent aucun respect, ou que le culte qu’on leur rend est superstitieux.

I wonder why, or how, this particular image was used.Secondly, one has to be very precise about exactly what any particular FFT does. The weave of the Shroud means that the image appears largely on the warp threads, and not on the weft. Thus the warp threads are darker than the weft threads. However, in any photo, the weft threads appear the darker, because they are in shadow, forming ‘valleys’ between the warp thread ‘ridges.’ If we wish to remove the diagonal striping, we can average out the colour between say, a weft thread and one or both of its adjacent warp threads, or we could lighten the weft threads until they match the colour or intensity of the warp threads on either side. The latter would be preferable.What’s more, such ‘blood’ as remains on the Shroud is largely confined to the ‘valleys’ between the ‘ridges’ having been abraded from the more superficial threads, so that weft ‘bloodstain’ threads really are darker than ‘warp’ bloodstain’ threads, as well as appearing darker anyway because of the shadow effect. To achieve a uniform ‘blood’ colour, it would be better to lighten the weft a little to remove the shadow, and then to darken the warp to replace the blood where it has been worn off.I would like to know what exactly any particular FFT achieves in real terms.

However I’m still not what Roemer’s point is.1) His first paragraph is surely quite incorrect. Neither his ‘old’ model nor his ‘new’ model are now or have ever been recognised by evolutionary biologists. The gradual accumulation of adaptive characteristics cannot be modelled in either of those terms, and never has been.2) If the last sentence of paragraph two is intended to be supported by the rest of the paragraph, then the paragraph is a non-sequitur. The facts that a gas expands to fill its container, whereas in space a gas contracts to generate a star cannot be directly compared. Indeed the second law of thermodynamics predicts that where the energy of escaping from gravity is greater than the energy of gravitational attraction, a gas will not fill up its container. This is why the earth has an atmosphere, for instance. The behaviour of gases has no direct relevance to the evolution of organisms, which are not gases.3) I do understand that particles move faster when they are hotter. For all I know he may be right in saying that the kinetic energy of a gas molecule increases by 10000000000000000000000 times for every degree heated, although it seems quite a lot to me. Is that really what Boltzmann’s constant implies?4) The fact that a number of entities can be arranged in billions of different ways has no relevance to evolution. The number of possible proteins is constrained by a number of other conditions unrelated to the mathematical calculation, and even if it were not, proteins are not formed by the random accumulation of amino acids.5) Roemer is correct in saying that evolution does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The only ‘non-physicists’ who think it does are people whose understanding of the universe comes from a mistaken interpretation of various religious scriptures.6) I have recently read two ‘scholarly papers’ (in the American Journal of Physics, brought to my attention by David Roemer himself) which refute the idea that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics. Neither of them is so simplistic as to claim that that ‘nature goes from order to disorder’. They both explain comprehensively how the entropy of the universe is not decreased by anything that happens on earth, and that any local or apparent decrease in entropy is invariably outweighed by an overall increase elsewhere.7) While Roemer is correct in saying that solar radiation tends to increase the entropy of the universe, he is wrong to apply this generalisation to photosynthesis. The decrease in entropy due to photosynthesis is trivial compared to the overall increase due to solar radiation, and is at any rate temporary.8) The article to which Roemer specifically refers (Styer, 2008) makes huge generalisations concerning the rate of evolution, and applies figures derived from these to standard entropy equations. The equations are not ‘fake,’ although the figures may be ‘absurd.’ A subsequent paper (Bunn, 2009) made serious adjustments to Styler’s figures, but the equations were just as relevant and the conclusion identical – that in sheer mathematical terms evolution does not break the second law of thermodynamics. In other papers, mathematicians making different assumptions come to the conclusion that evolution actually increases entropy, which more obviously doesn’t violate the second law.After all that I still do not understand Roemer’s fundamental conviction. If it is simply that he disagrees with Daniel Styer’s numerical assumptions then he may well be right and others concur. However their papers have been accepted rather than his because they have explained precisely where his assumptions were erroneous and proffered better ones of their own. If, on the other hand, Roemer believes that evolution is intrinsically impossible according to currently understood science, and that an alternative science must be adduced to explain it, then I think he should say so.","date":"December 4, 2012 at 5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/02/rupert-sheldrake-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rupert Sheldrake on Science and Religion"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“Natural selection explains only adaptation, not common descent.” Fortunately evolution contains rather more than natural selection, and the study of DNA and genetic mutation explain both adaptation and common descent very well indeed, without the need for ID.“There is no evidence for intelligent design.

Almost by definition, “selection” suggests that a variety of things already exist, from which one or more may be ‘selected,’ and others rejected. As far as that goes, I could not disagree. However, “evolution” consists firstly of the provision of variety, through mutation, genetic drift and sexual recombination, and only secondly of “Natural Selection.” To equate Evolution and Natural Selection is wrong, and repeating the fact that Selection explains variety but not innovation does not make it right. Not being a high-school or college teacher I do not have access to textbooks, but I do not believe that they restrict their explorations of evolution to Natural Selection alone, and to imply that they do is a gross distortion of their intent. For the edification of anybody else who may be following this thread, here are a couple of quotes from the internet:–  British Natural History Museum: “Evolution is driven by random changes in the genes of organisms, called mutations, and a complex process called natural selection.”–  Biology Online: Evolution is “the change in genetic composition of a population over successive generations, which may be caused by natural selection, inbreeding, hybridization, or mutation.”–  And even Wikipedia: “Life evolves by means of mutations (changes in an organism’s hereditary information), genetic drift (random change in the genetic variation of a population from generation to generation), and natural selection (the non-random and gradual process of natural variation by which observable traits (such as eye color) become more or less common in a population).”However, I do find that some avowedly creationist / intelligent design sites, and for I know their textbooks too, do try to omit mutation from their considerations of evolution, presumably because it is easier to deny evolution if you ignore half of its exposition.","date":"December 5, 2012 at 9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/02/rupert-sheldrake-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rupert Sheldrake on Science and Religion"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Now I’m baffled beyond redemption.I can supply quotes from biologists saying that natural selection acting upon innovations explains the complexity of life; I did in my previous post.As it happens I do have a copy of The Greatest Show on Earth, which devotes many pages to mutations. “Mutations are the random changes in genes that constitute the raw material for evolution by non-random selection,” Dawkins explains at one point, and at another: “Lenski’s research shows … many of the essential components of evolution by natural selection: random mutation followed by non-random natural selection … the way successive mutations build on their predecessors to produce evolutionary change …”I utterly deny that I have been duped by either atheists or advocates of ID.

I gather that he feels that the energy input to the earth from the sun is insufficient to account for the energy required for evolution, whereas the article in the American Journal of Physics claims that it is.

Nowadays, we expect our miracles to at least have some semblance of scientific rationality, even if they defy the laws of physics, but I don’t think the medieval mind was so constrained. A painting might have appeared miraculously after Jesus had simply wiped his face on a cloth, just as curing somebody need not require the laying on of hands or the application of any substance.

That enlightening tome “Last Journey and Memorials of the Redeemer, or Via Crucis, as it is in Jerusalem” by the Rev. J.J. Begel, published in 1880, explains how.“Since, as in the case of the cross, this abundance might become a pretext for denying their authenticity, we will endeavour to show that the Jewish manner of burial required large quantities of linen.” … “Hence the multiplicity of shrouds is now no longer a problem, and that great question of former times, who possesses the true shroud, the authentic shroud of our Saviour, has no longer any weight, and merely proves long ignorance of a fact.”Nor was the existence or not of an image at all a problem.“We know that after the embalming and enshrouding the ancients painted the mummies exteriorly. This was the last operation before restoring them to the family or bearing them to the tomb. From this cause, I think, among the holy shrouds that remain to us, some bear the image — not, indeed, very artistic, and traced with hurried hand— of our Saviour extended lifeless, and others do not.”Interestingly:“The two shrouds which bear the print of the body of Jesus Christ are that of Turin, in Piedmont, and that of Besancon, in Franche-Comte. … In this last the painting is not so vivid nor the traits so distinct as in the shroud of Turin.”","date":"November 25, 2014 at 5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"All the comments above illustrate the lengths various commenters, and the adherents of each particular cloth, would go to in order to demonstrate that their relic was as authentic as all the others.

There are even convoluted explanations as to how some shrouds had one image while the Turin Shroud has two. Max’s comment: “Its veneration was not so much linked to its being considered genuine as both being a shroud copy of or shroud substitute” is not borne out by the remarks of the 19th century commentators. In case of misunderstanding, I don’t think Colin personally thinks the Shroud was any kind of body-bag; however he is perfectly correct in saying that it was often described as the sheet into which Jesus was immediately placed after being taken down from the cross, or the sheet in which Jesus was transported to the tomb, in order to differentiate it from the several sheet/s in which Jesus was wrapped once in the tomb.It is perfectly possible that the Shroud of Besancon was destroyed in 1349, and also that that of Turin was destroyed in 1532.

Colin has been working on STuRP’s own assessment of the image as degraded cellulose. This, as they all pointed out, looks just like a scorch. They decided it couldn’t be because a) a scorch fluoresces and b) a scorch burns through to the other side. Colin quickly demonstrated that b is nonsense, and various other things as well – a scorch can show image density resembling a body/distance correlation, and a scorch is essentially a contact mechanism, not a radiation mechanism. However, niggling problems remained, and so he began to work on how to produce an effect indistinguishable from a scorch, but with lower heat and different chemicals. This is what I mean by “a kind of” scorch.His point about sweat is in contrast to Charles Freeman’s brighly coloured paint hypothesis. One thing a scorch does not look like is a brightly coloured painting. However, the Shroud has been described as being derived from sweat several times by pilgrims, who were saying what they saw, not suggesting a manufacturing process. If the Shroud was originally brightly coloured, then it could not have been intended to be its current brownish tinge, and any kind of scorch would have been a incidental byproduct, not a deliberate intention. This is my position, currently, although it could change any minute, and was cheerfully derided by Stephen Jones as he deliberately misinterpreted my statement to the effect that I thought the whole thing had been created by accident. Colin’s position is that Charles is wrong, and that the Shroud was deliberately intended to look like a sweat imprint from the start, so the “kind of scorch” that we see today was an integral part of the plan.Rather than vague derogatory remarks, which suggest that anoxie either has not read or has not understood Colin’s, Charles’s or my ideas and comments, he might do better to offer more specific criticisms, that one or other of us might be able to address.","date":"November 24, 2014 at 4:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks, Mo.","date":"November 27, 2014 at 3:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Rather than vague derogatory remarks, which suggest that anoxie either has not read or has not understood Colin’s, Charles’s or my ideas and comments, he might do better to offer more specific criticisms, that one or other of us might be able to address.","date":"November 24, 2014 at 5:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Max makes a couple of valid points above. When a “new” relic appeared, such as the Shroud, I suppose it was natural for supporters of rivals to try to denigrate it as much as possible. Nearly all the miraculous images, whether or not we include the Shroud, looked like obvious paintings, so it was easy to claim that while my painting was a miracle, yours was cooked up by an artist a few years ago. After a while, when the new relic had achieved popularity, respectability and episcopal, or papal, approbation (invariably in that order), then of course it had to be assimilated into the canon. The only denigrations I have seen are those of Pierre D’Arcis, but I dare say there were others of the various veronicas, shrouds and other images as they turned up.It is true that my sources are 19th century rather than, say 15th or 16th century, but can anyone say that individual relics were being denouced as fakes then? Apart, of course, from people like Calvin, who didn’t think any of them had any validity.Max’s next two points do not support his own argument. The Shroud which was turned into bandages was destroyed in the face of popular belief in its authenticity, as a deliberate challenge to it, by an avowedly atheistic authority. His third point, that relic authenticity was based first and foremost on certificates of authenticity not just popular beliefs, does not fully reflect the close relationship between the two. If a relic wasn’t popular (or thought likely to become popular), it didn’t receive hierarchical authority, although once it had done so, it’s popularity was no doubt enhanced.","date":"November 26, 2014 at 8:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No, that’s too simplistic.

Obviously no relic can be popular before being ‘presented.’ As a challenge to Bishop Henri it was suppressed. When it resurfaced it was obviously more popular, and, in spite of another attempt (D’Arcis) to supress it, it gained limited papal approbation.

Here goes:The colouration of the back of the shroud is mostly typified by a dark longitudinal stripe right down the middle, with a sharp edge on the nail-wound side, and a more attenuated edge on the spear-wound side. At first thought, one would guess that it was due to different batches of warp thread, differently processed, and so producing differently coloured longitudinal bands. However, I have always understood that the front side of the shroud was the side with the greater warp thread visibility – 75% –  (thanks to the 3/1 twill), while the proportion of visible warp thread on the back was only 25%.

At this late stage (the 14th century was towards the end of the relic making – or discovering – craze), he might have decided not to produce an out-and-out painting which was simply declared miraculous (like most of the other imaged cloths), and, as a sop to the increasing rationality of the age, produced one in monochrome that could be thought of as a ‘sweat’ or ‘blood’ imprint, but at first sight there seems no reason to produce a long thin cloth (most un-shroud-like) with a double image.However! If he was not producing a ‘relic’, but a liturgical illustration, for the particular purpose of being displayed across the Sanctuary of a church, held in front of or behind an altar on Easter Sunday, having wrapped a wooden body of Christ (quietly removed by clerics on Saturday evening) lying in a side chapel since being placed there on Good Friday, then he might well have produced a long thin cloth, with a representation of what a real body might have produced had it laid within it.This explanation would seem fanciful if we did not have countless accounts of just such a re-enactment occurring in monasteries, churches, and then outside during the development of mystery plays. The ‘Shrouds’ undoubtedly existed, and in vast numbers across Europe, although, in common with almost every other similar mystery play prop, not a single one remains. It is true that we have no description of any such Shroud, imaged or otherwise, and the few paintings of the scene do not show an image either, but such vestiges as remain can hardly be considered representative of the whole.I struggle myself with non-authenticist scenarios, as it happens, but this seems to me both sensible, possible, and historically justified.","date":"December 21, 2015 at 5:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No I don’t think there’s a contradiction, Mario. If an ancient ‘authentic relic of Christ’ had had a miraculous double image, I think Colin is correct in supposing that it would have been most unlikely not to have been well known. However, a mere liturgical prop need not have excited any particular interest, regardless of its illustration. At some point, of course, Charles Freeman’s contention is that the cloth was transformed from ‘mere prop’ to ‘authentic relic’  and it was at that point that Henri de Poitiers stepped in to correct the misapprehension. He knew that such liturgical ‘shrouds’ were common, and considered it absurd that the Canons of Lirey were attempting to pass one off as an authentic relic.So far, I think, so sensible. However, I do see some major objections to this scenario. If the Shroud had been brought from a long way away, from an area where the Quem Quaeritis was common to a place where it was unknown, or if it had been hidden away for a long time after the Quem Quaeritis tradition had died out, then its transformation would be understandable, but Bishop Henri claimed to have known the painter, which suggests recent, local manufacture. Charles thinks that a supposed ‘miracle’ associated with the cloth might have enhanced its reputation, but nobody who had known it before the miracle would have accepted it as the authentic burial cloth, miracle or not. One might speculate that a painter from somewhere else could have created a deliberate forgery based upon his knowledge of Quem Quaeritis shrouds (and assuming that Lirey had no such tradition), but I agree that there is no evidence for such a speculation. I agree completely that the historical and artistic arguments for a 13th/14th century manufacture are far from decisive, but then, the authenticist route from Jerusalem to Lirey, via Edessa, Constantinople, the Templars, the Crusades, the Mandylion and other possibilities is also far from decisively established.","date":"December 21, 2015 at 12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi Thomas, thanks for your comments. I have tried to explain how the precise features of the Shroud fit the Quem quaeritis ceremony above and in other posts…1) “The Shroud image is not one of a glorified risen Christ.” Well, of course not. As explained above, it was specifically to show the traces of a dead body. The whole point was that it was the shreds left behind, not anything to do with the Resurrection.2) “Why show an imaged burial shroud ‘to show Christ had risen’ if there was no tradition of a full body imaged shroud?” There was no tradition of any particular kind of Shroud. I think the faint image (and I differ from Charles on this point) was not to show a miraculous effect – which would certainly have been talked about and well known if such a tradition had been extant – but simply to differentiate this cloth as a ‘shroud’ from any other cloth, such as a table cloth or bed sheet.3) “The Shroud itself is of such length as to be quite a nuisance to ‘hold up’”. It certainly required two people, but I think that was the whole point, to be able to hold up something clearly ’empty’ before an entire congregation.4) “Why ‘manufacture’ a front and back image?” Holding up a ‘shroud’ for all the congregation to see meant that long and thin was obviously easier for the back rows than a squarer sheet, much of which was too low. Having decided on long and thin – a most unlikely shape for a real shroud, I may say – then the shape of the man wrapped in it, back and front, would fill the space better than a single image in the middle. Elsewhere I have also suggested that this may also be the reason why the images are placed head-to-head – also an unlikely configuration for a real shroud – rather that feet-to-feet.5) “The nude image goes against the art history grain.” Yes, it does, but again, I don’t think this scenario should be considered ‘art’ in any modern sense. Medieval theatre props were produced in their thousand, and not a single one remains. This was not a ‘work of art’ but a utilitarian indication of a body in a shroud for a drama. As such, I don’t think it broke any taboos. (And no, Charles has never said that there was originally a loin cloth that wore off. He suggested that at a much later date a loin cloth was painted on and that that has worn off, or been removed. That possibility is also highly debatable, but it is irrelevant to the origin of the Shroud.)Nothing definitive, I quite agree, and to those who think the Quem quaeritis hypothesis untenable, I have nothing but sympathy. However, I hope that they will at least have some idea why I think it could provide a reasonable context for a medieval origin, and have some sympathy in return!","date":"December 22, 2015 at 5:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No, Mario, I’m not sure you understand the distinction I am making. The development of the liturgical drama involving characters, a tomb in a side-chapel, and a shroud seem to have begun in the 9th or 10th century (see, for example, The Latin Passion Play, Its Origins and Development, by Sandro Sticca). By the 14th century its use was widespread all over Europe. Chifflet was talking of actual relics; he does not even mention the liturgical props, with or without an image on them. He certainly does not deny their existence.Although there are countless mentions of such shrouds, they are not described at all, and none remain. Such a lack of evidence does not preclude the possibility that some were painted.I’m not sure what you mean by: “The religious authorities at Troyes reasoned that such an image could not exist”. Bishop d’Arcis did say that had the real Shroud of Christ had an image on it the Gospels would have mentioned it, but the shrouds exhibited as part of the Quem Quaeritis ceremony were not intended to be mistaken for the real thing. They were illustrative, and educational, and I do not think that precludes the possibility that some were painted either.As I said above, there are some serious flaws in the ‘ritual-to-relic’ hypothesis, but I don’t think the image itself is one of them.","date":"December 21, 2015 at 3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Your “1997 CE RED HEIFER WATER IN-SOAKING & XYLOALOETIC FUMIGATION IMPRINTING”?

I see it begins (page 40): “Or incontinent apres le commencement du 13. siecle l’on voit la ceremonie de la monstre du sainct Suaire au jour de Pasques, couchee dans un certain ceremonial escrit devant l’union des deux Eglises de S. Jean, & de S. Estienne, faite en l’annee 1253. car cette ceremonie n’est point descripte dans le Rituel, comme nouvelle, mais bien comme en usage quelques annees auparavant: ce qui nous fait conjecturer que la ville de Besançon fut bien-heuree de ce present environ l’an 1100.” You may be able to help with the translation, as although it seems clear to me that the Quem Quaeritis ceremony was obviously well known in Besançon long before the arrival of its more famous Shroud, it also seems that the people may have been using another, non-authentic, shroud before the ‘authentic’ one appeared.In the book I mentioned, The Latin Passion Play, mentions on page 23 “two documents, both of the tenth century: the Regularis Concordia of St. Ethelwold of Winchester and the Quem quaeritis version from Saint-Martial of Limoges. Composed between 965 and 975, the Regularis Concordia contains rules […] and describes religious ceremonies […]. In it are found the earliest stage directions for the performance of an Easter play: the Quem quaeritis:” The Latin directions are then quoted, including:“Quo viso, deponant turribula, que gestaverant in eodem Sepulchro, sumantque linteum et extendant contra clerum, ac veluti ostendentes, quod surrexit Dominus et iam non sit illo involutus, […]. Superponante linteum altari.”“Having seen this, they lay down the thuribles with which they have been honouring the Tomb, and pick up the shroud, holding it out towards the clergy, as if to show that the Lord has risen from it and is no longer wrapped in it. … They place the shroud on the altar.”In the few pages, the book goes on to discuss both antecedents to and the extensive expansion of the ceremony in its dramatic form over the next few centuries.In all this, however, I can find no description of the shroud – big or small, square or long, painted or not. However I do not think that my reconstruction, particularly as it pertains to quite a late-comer to the field (400 years later), by which time the ceremony was much more clearly developed, is merely fanciful. The very fact that the Besançon shroud, which seems to have been an obvious painting, existed, lends some credibility to this hypothesis, don’t you think?","date":"December 22, 2015 at 5:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks for your help, Mario.

Brooks doesn’t even mention shrouds. Suggestive, but no smoking gun yet.Then we get to “Encyclopédie méthodique. Théologie. T. 3” (about 1790) at http://gallica.bnf.fr., and Abbé Bergier’s conclusion that “on conclut que le corps de Jésus-Christ ne fut point enveloppé d’un linceul entier, mais seulement avec des bandelettes comme Lazare. Ainsi les linceuls ou Suaires que l’on montre dans plusieurs Eglises ne peuvent avoir servi à la sépulture du Sauveur, d’autant plus que le tissue de ces Suaires est d’un ouvrage assez moderne.     Il est probable que dans le douzième & le treizième siècles, lorque [sic] la coutume s’introduisie de représenter les Mystères dans les Eglises, on représenta le jour de Pâques la Résurrection de Jésus-Christ. On y chantoit la Prose Victimae Pascali, etc. dans laquelle on fait dire à Madelaine: Sepulchrum Chrisit viventis & gloriam vidi resurgentis, Angelicos testes, sudarium & vestes: Au mot Sudarium on montroit au peuple un linceul empreint de la figure de la figure de Jésus-Christ enseveli. Ces linceuls ou Suaires conservés dans les trésors des Eglises, pour qu’il servissent toujours au même usage, ont été pris dans la suite pour des linges qui avoient servi à la sépulture de notre Sauveur; voilà pourquoi il s’en trouve dans plusieurs Eglises différentes, à Cologne, à Besançon, à Turin, à Bripoude, &c. & l’on s’est persuadé qu’ils avoient été apportés de la Palestine dans le temps des croisades.”“A sheet imprinted with the figure of the buried Jesus Christ.” We’re getting close…Now I’m assuming that ‘A French Bible dictionary of 1912’ is that of Paul Vigouroux, whose entry on Suaire includes: “Les autres ne serait que des nappes sur lesquelles on peignait autrefois le corps du Christ au tombeau et que l’on étendait ensuite sur l’autel pour célebrer la messe de Pâques.”“Cloths on which were once painted the body of Christ.”Sure, dictionaries are not primary sources, but it is clear that Charles is not alone in thinking that painted representations of Christ inhis shroud were used in the old Visitatio ceremony.","date":"December 23, 2015 at 7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, you’re quite right that to use 14th century imaged cloths as evidence that the Shroud is a Visitatio Sepulchri prop would be too circular to be convincing.

The first is Ray Rogers’s finding that fibres from the Shroud lack a vanillin component that some medieval fibres retain, and the second is Giulio Fanti’s explorations into the deterioration of linen fibres with age. Sadly neither of these has sufficient calibratory accuracy to pin the date to the first century (leaving aside Fanti’s rather fortuitous concocting of an average from a number of wildly different dates from vastly different techniques), and neither has any kind of scientfic consensus as a dating method which could be applied to other textiles, which would give them an objective credibility.Everything else is circumstantial, and some of it not evidence for a date at all. Pollen and limestone speak of the place, not the time, and the fact that the Shroud image coheres with Gospel narratives tells us nothing of the date at all. Miraculous hypotheses tell us even less, and generally tend to constrain, rather than display, the omnipotence of the Almighty.Authenticists have to rely on documentation and art. I do not deny that this is evidence, and some of it quite powerful, but the smoking gun is still sadly lacking.

Radiocarbon dating has massive scientific consensus as a dating technique, and is widely used in all kinds of circumstances. Barring deliberate fraud, there is little reason to suppose that the sample dated to 1300 was inaccurately dated. There have been numerous attempts to demonstrate that the sample tested was not representative, but they have not achieved consensus.Other evidence is circumstantial. The lack of clear documentation before 1350, the coherence of the Shroud to the religious rituals and theological trends in art of the 14th/15th century, and the claim that it was known who painted it are all evidence, some more powerful than others, but the smoking gun is still sadly lacking.

The whole idea of two or three, or half a dozen, undisputed “Shrouds”, and a similar number of smaller cloths or coifs, is generally untenable to modern thinking (although I note there are a few sites which still support it, and the Oviedo cloth has similar acceptance to the Turin Shroud). However, for several centuries previously, all these cloths were considered authentic, and a rationale had to be concocted to account for them. Whether Jesus was wrapped up in all these cloths simultaneously or at different times was variously sorted out by different people, who probably disagreed with each other. Whatever Adrien Baillet’s own enlightenment view (thanks Thibault), the idea that both that the Besancon and Turin Shrouds were authentic was clearly current in his time. What’s more, whereas we now think (rationally) that no clear image could be obtained while lowering or carrying a body in a cloth, this was not a problem to earlier minds, for whom even an obvous painting could have simply been an example of a miracle. Earlier on this subject, someone commented that nobody could imagine that after wiping his sweaty blood-smeared face with a cloth, a beautiful painting could have been left on it, when in fact this was exactly what people thought, and in some cases still do.In some ways, it occurs to me, the Turin Shroud was ahead of its time, bearing a more or less “realistic” imprint, when there was really no need for it to be anything more than a painting. Could this be because the late 13th century was really quite late in the craze for relics, and a more rational approach to miracles had already begun to manifest itself?","date":"November 28, 2014 at 3:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Are Andrea and daveb arguing at cross-purposes? Daniel Scavone himself writes, as the opening sentence of his “Documenting the Shroud’s Missing Years” that “History proceeds from documents, not arguments from silence. Besançon alone, of all the major theories of the Turin Shroud’s whereabouts during the missing 150 years, has documents to support its possession of the Shroud after the Fourth Crusade until about 1350, after which the Shroud’s history from Lirey to Turin is well established.” He then reviews various letters and documents from about 1200. Assuming that these were not subsequent forgeries, which is not necessarily wise, the question then becomes; do these documents support the hypothesis that Otho de la Roche owned a shroud? Scavone refers to a letter written from the Emperor Alexius V Mourtzouphlus to Pope Innocent III in 1204, specifically complaining that the Holy Shroud had been stolen by Otho de la Roche, which is evidence, if not conclusive. The letter may be a forgery, or the shroud may have been a different one from Turin’s, or the Emperor was mistaken, but there is a document, and that’s what it says.Now for the image. Scavone gives no evidence that the Besancon shroud bore an image, but only assumes that it must have done by conjecturing that it became the Turin Shroud in about 1350. As the conjecture is only circumstantially evidenced, so must the suggestion that the Besancon shroud bore an image be similarly only a conjecture.","date":"November 30, 2014 at 8:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"In his “Orphaned Manuscript,” which although impossible to get hold of is quite substantially available on Google Books, Adler explains the red blood colour in fascinating complexity, all of which sounds quite good except for: “You now mix bilirubin which is yellow-orange with methemoglobin in its para-hemic form which is an orangey-brown and you get blood which has a red colour.” Although I do not have access to these materials, I can mix colours in a paint palette, and I cannot make the shrouds pinky red ‘carmine’ colour from brown and orange, however hard I try.More curious still, Adler goes on to say: “In fact, we have been able to simulate this spectrum in the laboratory by the process described above.” Well I’d love to know how.

So, following my promise of always following up any theory, this, I think, is what you propose. Please correct me if I’m wrong, and attempt to answer some of the questions, which are not contradictions, but requests for clarification.1) Having been scourged and tortured, and now covered in blood sweat and dust, Jesus was dressed in the Tunic of Argenteuil.2) After being crucified, he was taken down from the cross in a rigid state of rigor mortis, and his face covered with the Sudarion of Oviedo.3) Arriving at the tomb, he was laid on the Shroud on a preparation table, which had two stones or bags of myrrh granules placed to elevate the body from the surface, and the Shroud laid over them.4) Leaving the body unwashed and unwiped, the Shroud was folded back over the top of his body, and secured tightly with the Veil of Manopello, the Cap of Cahors, and the Sindon Munda.5) The shroud itself was wet, having been soaked in an alkaline mixture including Red Heifer water, Jerusalem limestone and powdered starch. Ammonia derived from urea in the sweat may have contributed to the alkalinity.6) Within the wrappings, various bits of plant material, and wooden artefacts were also placed.7) The body was then fumigated on both sides with vapours arising from the myrrh and aloes, which contained a blood-intensifier.8) As a result of the fumigation or a natural drying process, the Shroud shrunk, pulling itself away from the body to leave various areas of non-contact.9) The blood marks were formed by contact with the cloth.10) The image was formed by bodily contact with the cloth, and also by some form of emission resulting in action at a distance, collimated by the dust covering the surface of the body.11) Finally the whole assemblage was wrapped in the Sudarium of Kornelimunster and placed in the burial chamber.I hope Max feels that I have represented him correctly, and that others find this description more coherent than previous attempts.My questions are:1) Can we have some sources for the idea that any of this was typical Jewish burial practice?2) What is ‘Red Heifer water’?3) What does ‘fumigated on both sides’ [first on one side and then on he other side] mean?4) What was the nature of the emission from the body to produce the action at a distance represented by the intensity differences on the Shroud?3) How did the dust on the body collimate the emission?Once I have really understood your hypothesis properly, I will be in a better position to comment on whether it has any credibility.","date":"April 24, 2015 at 5:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Apart from the detail that I don’t find the authenticity arguments as powerful as daveb, I agree with the tenor of his posting whole heartedly.

Googling him in an attempt to find out more, all I get is from the BSTS Newsletter on Shroud.com. “J. Bruno Azzola, “A Possible Image Transfer Mechanism on the Shroud of Turin.” The Author, a Roumanian engineer working in West Germany (or perhaps a translator) has made a valiant attempt to write in English. Scientists familiar with what the Author is talking about may be able to figure it out.” Now, I hold up my hands here. I don’t know what his ideas are. But don’t now jump up and down in glee shouting “Go and do your homework” as usual. I’m absolutely certainly you don’t know what he’s talking about either, so would you like to explain?Next, “I personally made two attempts in 1994 and 1997.” Yes, so you said before. But you didn’t say what you did or what the results were. That’s not an explanation at all.And what, finally, is the energy beam? It’s “a collimated/ body-shaped like vaporographic beam of energy resulting from fumigation of the alkaline water in-soaked inner winding burial sheet (aka TS) moulded around the body front and back.” Oh, dearie me, Max. What on earth is a “vaporographic beam of energy”?In short, Max, hurling neologisms around is not the same thing as explaining something.What was the “vaporographic beam of energy” made of?How did the “DUST-(urea residue)-blood COVERED body-like membrane shroud” collimate the energy into producing a picture?Simple questions – simple answers please!.","date":"April 29, 2015 at 11:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Could somebody with more experience of magic than I explain how a kiss defends against shape-shifting?","date":"March 14, 2013 at 5:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/13/the-shroud-connection-shape-shifting-jesus-described-in-ancient-egyptian-text/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud Connection: Shape-Shifting Jesus Described in Ancient Egyptian Text"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“Since it is not a matter of faith, the Church has no specific competence to pronounce on these questions.” (From the Vatican.va translation of “Pastoral Visit of His Holiness John Paul II to Vercelli and Turin (Italy) May 23-24, 1998).

Complicated stuff. It is possible to dispute the indisputable? Or is the term indisputable entirely subjective, so that although A considers something indisputable, B is entirely at liberty to dispute it without there being a logical contradiction?“The Shroud of Turin already has proved, beyond reasonable doubt, Christ’s physical resurrection and therefore that Christianity is true.” For Stephen, this is indisputable, and therefore, for him, any attempt to dispute it is the mark of those who “don’t like the implications of there being scientific proof that Christianity is true.” Trouble is, however solid his axiom is for him, it is an airy nothing for others, both Christians (like myself) and Non-Christians. Even if I were convinced (“beyond reasonable doubt”) that the Shroud image was derived directly from the crucified Christ, I would not consider that it proves, or even suggests, the veracity of the Resurrection, nor that “Christianity is true” (whatever that really means). The scientific truth of Christianity does not depend on, nor is supported by, an authenticist interpretaton of the Shroud.Jason has interesting things to say about miracles, and I think his comments very sensible, for a given definition of the word miracles. My objection to the scientific investigation of miracles in a supernatural sense is that there are no parameters within which such an investigation can be made. If the yellowing of the cloth was caused by a miracle, then it is fatuous to bother with the precise direction or intensity of the radiation which might have caused it, as any or all values are equally valid. There was a thernonuclear explosion which only affected the Shroud? Well, why not? There was a faint exhalation of postmortem vapour? Well, why not? With a miracle, all things are possible. However I do enjoy his request that, although believers in miracles have nothing to investigate, the non-believers continue their work, on the grounds that the less successful they are, the more the supernatural hypothesis is strengthened.This is also the reasoning behind John Klotz’s quoting Sherock Holmes: “When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Needless to say, I don’t think natural causes for the image of the shroud have been eliminated as impossible. I don’t even think a 13th or 14th century origin for the Shroud has been eliminated as impossible. I certainly don’t agree that “All explanations for the image have failed, and must be eliminated.”Finally, there is a grain of truth in Stephen’s insistence that if something ought to have been discovered but hasn’t been, then that is evidence that it wasn’t there in the first place. I just don’t think it applies to the Shroud. In spite of many years of interest, there has been very little systematic effort to duplicate the Shroud image-making mechanism. Such attempts as have been made, Vignon’s (pro-authenticity) and Garlaschelli’s (anti-authenticity) being perhaps the most promising so far , have all been little more than first steps along a possible path of investigation rather than thorough explorations of the underlying hypotheses.","date":"April 1, 2014 at 10:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/01/the-shroud-that-defies-scientific-explanation-part-2/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud that Defies Scientific Explanation (Part 2)"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"You may be right, but I bet I’d give the jury something to think about as the Attorney for the Medieval!","date":"April 1, 2014 at 11:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/01/the-shroud-that-defies-scientific-explanation-part-2/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud that Defies Scientific Explanation (Part 2)"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"We have been looking at similarities (or supposed similarities) between the Manoppello veil and the Shroud quite recently, and a quick search through this blog will show you both sides of the argument quite well.

It is surely true that perhaps 90% of all weaving is simple over and under 1-1 weave. This requires only a single heddle, which either raises or depresses alternate warp threads. 3-1 twill requires four heddles, alternately raising every fourth warp thread, and is indisputably more complicated. Whether it has a herringbone pattern or not is a feature of how the threads are set up on the heddles and, once set up, is no more complicated to make than ‘ordinary’ twill. The exact proportion of twill to 1-1 is not particularly relevant – there is a lot of cloth made, and even 1% would not, I think be considered terribly rare, although it would certainly be less than common. It may be that it was more expensive than ordinary cloth and has been disproportionately preserved. I’m afraid that I find the idea that there is no 3-1 herringbone twill from the 13th century anywhere in Europe difficult to credit. However it may be very rare, and I can well understand nobody wanting to lose any of it, even a (large) postage stamp size, just to act as a control. After all, the shroud would only be the most valuable cloth in creation if it was the genuine article, and there would be no guarantee of that before the control was destroyed. Another reason may be that by 13th century samples of fabric are complete articles rather than fragmentary, and chopping any sample off would damage them beyond tolerance.I note the complaint that Wilson’s word “unusual” is graced with a [sic] by Weaving Fan. However it is an odd word. What, I wonder, is ‘usual’ about the shroud? How many similar shrouds are there to compare it to before anything about it can be considered either usual or unusual? I think I would need half a dozen or so before I could class one of them as “unusual.”Having said that, Weaving Fan is being slightly disingenuous in his quote from Raes: “The type of weave is not particularly distinctive…” The paragraph from which it is taken begins: “At the beginning of our age both cotton and linen were known in the Middle East.” It is clear that here Raes is speaking of antiquity rather than the Middle Ages.Finally, and on a slightly different tack, and I don’t even know if it’s important, but on one side of a twill the warp threads dominate the visible area, and on the other side the weft.

Some, I’ve no doubt began as deliberate cynical ploys to extract money from the gullible, but others began as illustrations, some, as OK says above, were honest copies, and some were certified on the basis of possibility rather than certainly. A wooden beam in Jerusalem: a piece of the cross; it’s not impossible.Having gained acceptance, however, there is no reason to suppose that the vast majority of ecclesiastical relic traders were dishonest or insincere, and the more ecclesiastical hands through which a relic passed the more certification it acquired, until its original provenance was wholly irrelevant.I do think OK makes a good point about respecting the heritage of these things.

However if the ‘publication’ version was not an actual copy, but a kind of list of required characteristics which an artist had to include, either written or sketched by the ‘nihil obstat’ and ‘imprimatur’ authorities as required, that might be a realistic compromise.","date":"December 12, 2015 at 6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Can you suggest any “genuine Second Temple period Jewish scholars” of which you approve, Max?

Yes, ’tis I, not wholly ignorant of biblical archaeology, who finds nothing remarkable in the findings of Sapir-Hen and Ben-Josef, whose camel dating only confirms what had already been well established anyway, that domesticated camels only arrived in the mines of the lower Levant (south of the Dead Sea) round about 1000 years BC.Jones is wrong about the “argument from ignorance” and the “if we haven’t found it, therefore it doesn’t exist” suggestion. The site described was in continuous occupation since the late 14th century BC, and layer after layer of faunal studies show what animals were present at the site. Camels are conspicuously absent before the late 10th century, and conspicuously present after it. This is definitely suggestive of their introduction at about that time.It is perhaps worth mentioning here that Abraham is not mentioned in Sapir-Hen and Ben-Josef’s paper, nor is there any discussion of biblical chronology at all, but they do mention the rock-art conveniently omitted from the Huffington post article. It is apparent that Jones hasn’t read their paper, although it is freely available by clicking their names on the first line of the article.It is not impossible that the story of Abraham is based on truth, but there is no archaeological consnsus about him. Some think he is wholly legendary, and others that he may represent an actual migration, but there is little suggestion that this occurred long before the first millennium BC, in spite of literal biblical chronology. The idea that the biblical contemporary of Abraham called Amraphel is to be identified with Hammurabi of Babylon in about 1750 BC is much disputed.Dr. Robert Harris, an eminent Jew, said to the Huffington Post: “This is just one of many anachronisms in the Bible, but these do not detract from its sanctity, because it is a spiritual source, not a historical one.” Jones boldly announces that this may be a Jewish view, but it is not a Christian one. Well, wrong again. There is no “Christian” position about the historical veracity of the bible. It is perfectly true that individual Christians may hold sincere beliefs, but they are only individuals, and cannot speak for Christianity as a whole. If anybody needs some kind of Christian consensus, they will have to have recourse to that massive collection of Christians, the Catholic Church (1.1 billion), or one of the larger alternatives if they can’t agree with Rome. It turns out that for the vast majority of Christians, Robert Harris’s views are wholly acceptable.","date":"February 11, 2014 at 6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/11/abraham-and-his-camels-the-shroud-of-turin-how-did-we-get-here/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Abraham and His Camels & The Shroud of Turin.

He hoped, and was probably correct, that this had no effect on his subsequent experiments. Although the linen is descibed as prepared “following the methods used in the Near East in Roman times,” no details are given in “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin.” I have acquired some quite stiff unbleached linen, however, and am prepared to give it a try, using leaves from soapwort mashed in water as a source of saponin, and commercial dextrin (a readily available water-soluble glue) as the starch. I also have ammonia and urea. The problem is “freshly dead” animals. The trouble here is to acquire enough for sufficient repeatable experimentation. However, after asking around, I find that people who keep snakes as pets feed them on frozen mice, which are available quite cheaply in bulk. This looks promising, so I’m preparing an appropriate protocol for just the experiments you suggest!Incidentally, although my linen feels quite stiff and heavy, it has an areal density of only 16mg/cm2, which is considerably less than the Shroud, which therefore appears to be considerably thicker than I had previously imagined. As such, I think it will be much easier to produce discolouration on one side of the cloth only. Other investigators (Thibault? Colin?) might be able to comment further on this, and readers of this blog might like to weigh a bed-sheet themselves to confirm how flimsy it is compared to the Shroud.","date":"April 4, 2014 at 5:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/am-i-the-only-one/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Am I the only one?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yannick, do any of the above postings mean anything?

You do not have a right to criticise his character, his beliefs or his faith, because you know nothing about them, and when overexcitement has led you into intemperate language, your views have been deleted by Dan, which, of course, he has every right to do.So you know Thibault is not an expert in ancient textiles or the chemistry of scorched linen.

Not being a scientist you do not know whether his conclusions are valid, so reject them by appeal to “lack of authority.” I think that’s a perfectly reasonable position to hold.

Transporting a dead body from cloth to tomb, even if the tomb was so extraordinarily close to the execution site as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre would have us believe, must surely have involved some kind of covering, if just to protect the carriers from the blood and grime, and such a cloth may or may not have been used as a shroud, or just left in the tomb with the shroud. I don’t think the painters who showed a cloth being used to lower the body from the cross, or to carry it to the tomb, gave any thought to whether it was the same one as ended up covering the body. Whenever the burial cloths are shown in medieval iconography there are nearly always two, one big and one small, as suggested by the Gospel.If the Turin Shroud is a medieval fabrication, it is relevant to ask ourselves if it was meant to be a ‘realistic’ representation of what the holy women found on Easter morning, or an image ‘miraculously’ appearing on a cloth. If miraculous, then it should be brightly (if ‘cunningly’) painted to show the power as well as the majesty of the miracle-worker, but if quasi-realistic it should be fainter and look as if it might be made out of sweat and blood. It is also relevant to ask ourselves how the Shroud was meant to be displayed. If it were to form either a reredos above an altar (as in the recent ostentations), or an altar frontal, then its long thin shape could be explained that way, without consideration of whether it was ‘meant’ to be thought of as either a transport cloth or the burial shroud itself.It is not until the 18th century, I think, that some kind of rationalisation of the various different (all genuine) shrouds was needed, whereupon the Turin Shroud was usually thought of as the transport cloth and the Besançon one was the actual body-covering. Even today, sudariumchristi.com goes to elaborate lengths to incorporate as many cloths as possible.I do not know how precise the word ‘shroud’ needs to be. I think even Colin accepts that the cloth is meant to represent a cloth wrapped around a dead body, and I think that any such cloth can legitimately be referred to as a shroud even if it was only used for transport.","date":"July 13, 2015 at 6:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/13/beg-your-pardon-comment-promoted/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Beg Your Pardon (Comment Promoted)"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes; I’m sorry, Leon, but I fear Max Frei’s attempts to characterise the pollen he found on the Shroud as Middle Eastern have not withstood scrutiny.

If I did not believe in the existence of any kind of God, then I would neither need nor care to ‘want’ the entity I deny to do anything. I do not ‘want’ dragons not to breathe fire, and I do not ‘want’ Father Christmas to go on a diet, and I do not ‘want’ Bigfoot to be a vegetarian; I do not have ‘requirements’ for non-existent entities.But I think the thinking behind OK’s argument is this: if I do not believe in God because the world is full of evil, then, if the world was completely free of evil, would I change my mind? The answer, of course, must be, I don’t know. There may be all sorts of other corollaries that would affect my decision. One such, which seems to be implied by OK’s question, is that a world completely free of evil could be a denial of Free Will, which, in some theologies, is an attribute of God’s love. So by making God more “all-loving” by removing all evil, we at the same make him less “all-loving” by his denial of free will, which is a paradox.The way out, of course, is to postulate a third scenario. Suppose that God created man in his own image etc., etc. as postulated in the bible, and gave man free will to do good or evil, also as postulated in the bible, and more, that men, from the creation until now, entirely from their own free will, and in spite of numerous temptations, chose not to commit any evil. Suppose further, if you will, that, entirely by chance, men chose not to build their homes in the paths of any natural disasters, so that nobody died of tsunamis or earthquakes or hurricanes either. And now suppose there was a discussion about whether a God who ‘looked after’ his creation existed or not. I submit that there woud be less opposition to belief in his existence than there is now.Does that answer OK’s question, do you think?","date":"January 9, 2015 at 7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The filmed Interview with El Mundo as published at the link provided doesn’t mention Dawkins at all, let alone provide all those quotes attributed to Peter Higgs.

Emanuela Marinelli, I thank her, writes as a scientist. She has this to say regarding the possibility that the radiocarbon-dating laboratories produced their 13th century result from a mixture of 1st and 16th century material:Sindonologist Maria Grazia Siliato, considering the abnormal weight of the Shroud sample used for the radiocarbon dating, suggested the presence of a mending instead. Sindonologists Joseph Mario and M. Sue Benford provided some evidence of the existence of an “invisible” mending dating to the sixteeth century in the area where the sample for radiocarbon analysis was taken, including differences in thread colour and size and weave pattern. Flury-Lemberg denies the existence of such a darn, but, according to Savarino “the sampling site does not exclude this hypothesis.”Later, perhaps, I may demonstrate reasons for doubting “the abnormal weight of the Shroud sample,” as well as the “differences in thread colour and size and weave pattern” but my point here is to show that scientists do not “prove” things, such that anybody who denies them is an idiot. Scientists, humbly, “suggest” things. They “provide some evidence for” things. They find evidence which “does not exclude a hypothesis.”However fanatical one may be emotionally in support of a hypothesis, one seldom supports one’s case by insulting those who find faults in it, and one definitely weakens one’s case by attributing motives for their doubts for which one has no evidence at all.But then, I can only speak for science.

Well that’s nonsense, as has been demonstrated many times on this blog. From the accidental product of an unconnected burial in the 1st century to a devout attempt to represent Christ’s passion for the reverence of believers in the 14th century, there is ‘middle ground’ in abundance, and I have wandered about in it with fascination for months.Then we have the “scientists have tried to manufacture the shroud…..” as if failure was evidence for authenticity. My guess is that most of the scientists trying to explain how the image was formed, by quite a large margin, were in fact trying to show how it was formed by the body of Christ, not by a medieval forger. From Paul Vignon, through Ray Rogers and John Jackson to Giulio Fanti, via the vaporograph, Maillard reaction, and all the radiation, laser and plasma theories, not to mention those on the very fringe of scientific credibility, such as quantum dissapearance or biophotonics, pro-authenticity scientists have not only failed to expain how a body could produce an image, but cannot even agree about the actual configuration of either the body or the shroud required to produce one. In the face of this utter inability to produce a shroud by natural means, then obviously it must be….. Ah, but I don’t use arguments from ignorance, so I don’t go down that road!In that context, let’s rewrite Stephen Jones’s paragraph above, shall we…“The “authenticists” (who are themselves “believers” in the Shroud’s authenticity) have no evidence that the Shroud was “a product of a dead man in Jerusalem”. They cannot cogently explain: Who conjured it up? [Well, I suppose we must grant them them the who and when, although they are matters of faith rather than evidence] How was it conjured up? When was it conjured up? Why can’t they conjure it up (i.e. make a convincing replicate copy of the whole Shroud)? The “authenticists” (so-called) cannot even agree on how the Shroud was “conjured up”.Not such a bold argument for authenticity now, is it? Now let’s have a look at his quotation from Ian Wilson:“Yet ingenious as so many of these ideas are, the plain fact is that they are extremely varied and from not one of them has come sufficient of a groundswell of support to suggest that it truly convincingly might hold the key to how the Shroud was…” the end of this quotation could just as easily read “naturally made” as “forged.”One more? Stephen Jones again:“Similarly, if the Shroud were [1st century / 14th century], the science of the 20th-21st century should have discovered that by now. So that absence of proof by modern science that the Shroud is [1st century / 14th century], after 35 plus years of intensive scientific study of the Shroud, is positive proof that the Shroud is  [fake / real]!” [Delete at whim.]And then I’m told my doubts are unreasonable!We end with the most unreasonable, irrational, merely emotional appeal of all, that the Shroud is scientific proof that Christianity is true.

This is not true. A glance at just the bloodstains above the eyes, or across the back, shows a wide variation of image intensity around them.Furthermore, the major part of those bloodstains which could have resulted from body- contact which was later removed would be, in a body being carried in a sheet, around the sides of the legs and sides, where we know there ought to be plenty of whip marks, as these are found on the front of the legs too. So there ought to be a large number of off-register scourge-marks down the sides of the dorsal legs, which there aren’t.

I think even authenticists have generally abandoned the idea that surface contamination even before pre-treatment consisted of more than half the measured weight of the samples (necessary for it to hae an effect), and the pre-treatment reduced it to a minimum. Two other possibilites are that the linen itself is not original, for which, in spite of some serious investigation, evidence is currently insufficient, or that the original linen has had C14 atoms either created (via neutron radiation) or added (via carbon monoxide), for which evidence is even less.daveb (below) is correct that this is a perennial topic, but I don’t think we should tire of investigating it.

The alternative hypothesis is that the radiocarbon corner is not representative of the whole; the evidence for this is some reports about variable cotton content, Rogers’s vanillin experiments, his observations of a surface layer of gum and madder, and unjustified accusations of grubby fingeredness among medieval episcopacy.And no, not again! “You can’t explain how it was done, so I must be right and you must be wrong.” This is indeed the common consensus among authenticists, but not, thank goodness, among non-authenticists, who recognise it for the specious argument it is.","date":"November 15, 2014 at 1:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"If the water you test is uniform, then grab sampling is be as good as any other, cheaper, quicker and uses less water.

The intensity/distance relationship (if some kind of action at a distance is involved) or the intensity/pressure relationship (if there is only contact imprinting) is the same for the Gyotaku as for the Shroud. The Shroud image certainly gives the illusion of a photographic negative, as, in this particular case the intensity/distance and the intensity/pressure hypotheses are comparable to an intensity/luminosity relationship, which is what a photographic negative has.That the comparison is illusory is easily understood by considering the beard, and eyebrows of the image of the Shroud. These may be assumed to have been darker in colour, in life, than other parts of the skin. Any bruises the man might have developed would also be darker than the surrounding skin, and perhaps the nose and lips also. However these all appear as lighter on the ‘positive’ than the surrounding skin.Of course the luminosity of a normal photo is related to the reflectivity of the surface, while the luminosity of a luminous body is related to the emission intensity of the radiation. However, the negative image of the Shroud does not look like a body glowing from within, it looks like a normal reflected light photograph. If we claim that in this case actual emitted luminosity can be related to supposed reflected luminosity, then we still have the curious paradox of why the hair should emit stronger radiation than the skin. Attempts to explain that for this unique occasion, the entire surface of the body was equally emissive, that the emission was entirely vertical, and that the emission was strongly attenuated (to zero over 4 cm) entirely by distance and nothing else, are not characteristic of any known radiative body.So, no. “Some sort of light, X-ray or some sort of radiation type waves” do not “have to be involved” and “the surface of the linen cloth” does not have “to act like photographic or X-ray paper.”","date":"June 10, 2015 at 9:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/08/guest-posting-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Guest Posting by Yannick Clément"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“But I am using it show the effect of radiation to the Shroud image.” But it doesn’t show the effect of radiation on the Shroud image.

However, I am also not a great fan of the appeal to authority simply because the authority is an authority. This approach leads to the “my expert is better than your expert” kind of bickering, and, although it seems to have passed Yannick by, he is not the first person to have consulted an “expert in ancient Jewish burial rituals.” There are undoubtedly several others of equally impeccable credentials who would disagree with some of his opinions.No, an expert is useful not because “he is an expert,” but because of his ability to explain how he has come to his opinions, via his research. Yannick’s “Am I right?  –  Yes you are” conversation is unlikely to convince anybody who disagrees with him. If Yannick really wants his expert to sound convincing, he must words his questions to attempt to disprove his hypothesis. So:1) Have any 1st century Jewish burials been found with flowers (or papyri, ropes, coins, etc) associated with them? In what circumstances?2) How good is our evidence for what exactly was the ‘prescribed ritual?’3) Were there particular rituals for people who were executed criminals, or had to be buried in a hurry? Is there evidence of exceptional procedure in such cases?4) Could the fact that Jesus was thought of as God have influenced his followers in diverting from the prescribed ritual?5) How closely were prescribed rituals followed anyway?

Having begged Zias to confirm that the Jews were sticklers for ritual observation (no coins, no flowers), he is nevertheless happy to believe that it was bypassed in the case of the washing of the body (no washing), simply in order to account for some of the alleged blood flows. I don’t think appealing to ‘experts’ in one case, and ignoring them in another, gives credence to his hypothesis.Finally, Yannick wants a rational answer to two questions – why coins? and why flowers? Various people, particularly Max, have given sensible replies to these. The hurried burial, the intention to return to complete the ritual, the social variety of Jesus’s followers, the belief that he was the son of God, the company of women, the necessity of weighing down the eyelids, even the Roman guards could all have had something to do with it.But that’s not really important.

Firstly Colin is correct to query established dogma. Too much of it is based on remarkably little evidence. We must not forget that the only things the STURP team (or Rogers later) had to work on were individual fibres stripped from the surface of the shroud by sticky tape, or the occasional snippet of extracted thread, rarely more than a few centimetres long. I have studied a lot of linen fibres, scorched and unscorched, with a microscope, and find that whether the lumen (lumen, note, a plant fibre has a lumen; wool has a medulla – why do we have to perpetuate Rogers’s error?)  is well defined or not is as often a feature of the lighting conditions as of any chemistry. Well scorched fibres may or may not have obvious lumens, as, indeed, may unscorched ones. After all the lumen itself is a void; any colouration must be of its wall, and extremely thin. Thibault’s paper referenced above has lots of micrographs of scorched fibres not one of which has a dark lumen.In his later work, Rogers identified not simply his thin surface ‘impurity’ layer, which he attributed to an evaporation gradient produced from a solution of dextrin, but also the fact that it dissolved in water. Not so the image on the Shroud, which is clearly visible ‘through’ the big water stains across it. The solubility (or just wash-away-ability) of Rogers’s layer is a major objection to its validity.As I mentioned before, the UV problem (which I know Colin does not think significant) is to me the only objection to the image being a scorch. Almost everyone on the STURP team commented on how similar the image looks to a scorch to the eye (the scorched ironing board), the ‘top-of-the-ridge’ image marks of Mark Evans’s micrographs have clearly and easily been replicated several times, not least by Thibault himself, and microscopically it is clear that individual fibres, and fragments of fibres, can be scorched selectively without the scorch discolouring an entire thread thickness. Whether it actually is a scorch, and how it was done if so, is still a mystery to me, but the chemical and physical arguments against it being a scorch (apart from the UV) have largely been discredited.","date":"August 18, 2014 at 8:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/18/into-a-world-not-cut-off-from-reality/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Into a World Not Cut Off from Reality?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I don’t think Jackson is at all stupid.

Not for the first time, I think, I am somewhat at odds with Fr Longenecker’s cursory ideas about scientfic, historical and sindonological facts, but most of all, and he is not alone in this, I strongly object to the idea that anybody who does not believe in the authenticity of the Shroud is an atheist. I do not believe that I am any less a committed Roman Catholic than Fr Longenecker himself, but, in common with many other equally committed Roman Catholic scientists, I believe that universe is supremely rational, and do not believe in all his “angels or aliens, demons or devils, goblins or gods.” The sly way he has coupled this bunch together says a lot about his argument. He will jump down my throat, I am sure, with: “Aha, so you don’t believe in angels or god!” but will no doubt claim that my riposte “Aha! so you do believe in aliens and goblins!” should not be taken seriously. This is not the place to discuss the theology of angels, but clumping them together with goblins is simply trite. Sure, “if atheistic materialism is right there are not intelligent, reasonable, personal exterior forces superior to the natural world who might interfere or interact with the natural world,” but I believe that even if atheistic materialism is wrong the world is not beset with “personal exterior forces” who interfere with the natural world. And why do I think that? Because of the total lack of evidence for any such things. [At this point, people who disagree with me give a long list of miracles, usually including rainbow Buddhists and the visions at Fatima, none of which I think demonstrate any ‘outside’ interference with the natural world, least of all the Shroud, which even most of its authenticist adherents do not think is supernatural. Please don’t bother; I already know them all.]In common with many other authenticists (even ‘rational’ ones), Fr Longenecker lists evidences about the Shroud, and on the basis of a 9-1 majority, imagines that his case would be proved to anybody looking “objectively, carefully and with an open mind.” As usual, most of the nine are irrelevant or highly disputed, even among the authenticists themselves (No. 7, for example – “the shroud shows details perfectly consistent with first century Jewish burial customs”, or No. 9 – The cloth is consistent with fabrics from first century Israel). I don’t wish to repeat myself (find other references to Fr Longenecker at shroudstory), but will at least reiterate that “You don’t know how it was done”, which is the first and biggest plank in Fr Longenecker’s case, is not evidence for anything.Finally, unlike most authenticists, I am fully aware of the genuine evidence in favour of authenticity, and am not so convinced in non-authenticity that I would go to the stake for my opinion. As I have said many times, much of Dan’s apologia down the right hand side of this blog reflects my view exactly.

And what about the Mandylion?” I have no doubt whatever that I have examined all these in much greater detail than Bippy himself, and detailed both my inquries and the conclusions I derive from them on this blog. “THE FACTS” shouts Stephen in capital letters, “ARE SIMPLY IGNORED OR BRUSHED ASIDE AS SOMEHOW DECEPTIVE.” Well, I challenge anyone to find a single fact (or even vague hypothesis) that I have either ignored or brushed aside. A few posts ago Andrea Nicolotti couldn’t understand why I didn’t!

I have demonstrated evidence against authenticity, and in favour of a 12th or 13th century origin, which I personally find persuasive, but I fully accept that others do not. I agree with Thomas that non-authenticists face the problem of finding a context within which the Shroud was created, but have suggested lines of inquiry which may be worth pursuing. However, authenticists simply cannot – and they do, all the time – fall back on the “You don’t know how it was done artificially so it must be authentic,” argument. This is nonsense, and so easily reversed to say, with equal validity, “You don’t know how it was done authentically so it must be artificial.”Daveb is a good example of one who, like myself, has weighed all the arguments for and against, and although he has reached a different conclusion, he has carefully explained why. He has listed some debatable issues, and the evidence which he finds persuasive to him, and it is impossible not to respect that (although even he slips in the “You don’t know how it was done” argument at the end).Another constant of the authenticist argument – and this applies to almost everybody and is not specific to Daveb, Thomas or anyone else – is this business about the weight of evidence being sufficient, and a certain irritation with scientists who are pernickity about tiny details. I don’t agree with this. To a scientist the Shroud is not a maypole held up by so many guyropes that a few snapped ones here or there make no diference to its stability, but a reservoir held back by a dam made of many stones, within any of which a single crack threatens the stability of the entire edifice. I dare say a proper approach combines the two metaphors. Some evidence may be considered trivial by either side, and its validity or not makes little difference to the argument, but other evidence may indeed be stand-or-fall to the conclusion one eventually comes to. For me, one such is the radiocarbon evidence. If it were demonstrated satisfactorily that there was a Russian hacker, an episcopal switch, or any interweaving, then I would agree that on balance, the evidence now tipped in favour of authenticity. I believe also that I have tried harder than most to find such evidence, on the principle that a hypothesis stands or falls on its falsifiablility, but so far, I find it insufficient.Authenticists, I think, would go for historical provenance. If a good source of 3/1 twill were identified, an artist’s workshop and some models or preliminary sketches – if, finally, someone could satisfactorily say, “This is how it was done” – then many would concede that perhaps the evidence now tipped in favour of a medieval artifact.On with the search then…","date":"October 12, 2014 at 7:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/11/is-the-shroud-evidence-for-gods-existence/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Is the Shroud Evidence for God’s Existence?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Tsk!

So now Colin’s image must be shown to have “3D holographic properties.” Why? Because “FYI there is no one on earth that has a two dimensional image that contain the 3D properties of the TS.

Many people have weighed all the evidence for and against the authenticity of the Shroud and come down for or against authenticity as their personal position. Nothing wrong with that. Others have allowed the image on the Shroud itself, as an icon of Christ, to form their judgement, regardless of science, and that is a valid position too. But your position is that you have balanced the evidence in favour against – what? Nothing. You have not found any evidence against it. How could you fail to be convinced of the Shroid’s authenticity? How could anybody? Of course, in those circumstances, it is “reasonable to conclude that the relic is authentic.” I do not know where you have been looking, but this site, from its inception, has been devoted to examining all the evidence, for and against, in such excruciating detail that exact quotations from obscure publications, or minute blips in spectrographic analyses, have been debated for days.A person’s convictions are his own, and no one should deny him them, but when he communicates them publicly, he has some responsibility to his audience, especially to those who hold different opinions. It is not enough for him to explain why he is right; he must also try to explain why they are wrong. If he is unable to explain their attitude at all, then he cannot refute it, although he may simply consider them evil or mad.If RH has read any of my, or David Mo’s, or Charles Freeman’s or several others’ comments over the past months, he will have come across evidence in abundance to explain why we cannot agreee that the Shroud is authentic. He should have considered it, and decided that it was not sufficient to change his view of authenticity. To announce that he has never seen “evidence, of any sort … against it” is irresponsible, making, if I may paraphrase, hyperbolic certainty an unbeatable standard.

The Shroud is not a hologram. I do not know of any unique properties. In common with every other artifact, it has a blend of properties which make the object unique, but none of them is particularly mysterious.Talk is indeed cheap. I note your 10 comments so far with interest, but I’m not sure what evidence you would like me to show. Do you want me to demonstrate that the Shroud is not a hologram? Well, I have hologram in front of me here. It is of a flying bird and about a centimetre square. As I tilt the hologram I seem to see a 3D object in that some parts of the bird are revealed and hidden, as they would be were it solid, as I move it from side to side. The beak almost touches the tip of the left wing in one orientation, but is far removed from it in another. This does not happen with a picture of the Shroud. No part of the cheek is hidden by the nose as I change my point of view, nor do the fingers seem to change their orientation. The Shroud is not a hologram.When viewed in a VP-8 analyser, or by ImageJ, a 3D image can be generated from anything at all, more or less realistically. Whether the Shroud image is better than any other full-face, frontally lit, black background, portrait is somewhat subjective, but whatever the realism, a contour map of the 3D image, and thence a solid 3D object can be generated from it. A hologram could then be made of this object, just as it can of any object, using the appropriate equipment. The Shroud is nothing special in this respect. In spite of “doing my homework” I have yet to see anything different elsewhere in Shroud research. If Todd can show anything different, I would, of course, give it my most concentrated consideration.","date":"December 6, 2014 at 2:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/11/is-the-shroud-evidence-for-gods-existence/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Is the Shroud Evidence for God’s Existence?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"They did say that, didn’t they?

There is no doubt something similar on other credit cards. The Shroud is not a hologram.You mentioned Dr Soons, whose work was remarkable in several ways, and who did produce a hologram from the image on the Shroud. The production of the hologram, however, could have been just as easily achieved with any 3D image digitally plotted on a computer, and had nothing to do with the Shroud. Where he, and later Ray Downing, really achieved success was in their taking of the fairly crude bas relief achieved by the 3D software, and manipulating it into an image which better resembles a man lying down. No one could fail to be impressed by their achievement, but it requires considerable subjectivity and is really more of an art than a science. However, their starting point was no better than Colin’s scorch, and, had they bothered, they could have produced just as good a hologram from that as from the Shroud image.I have to say that I’m not sure that if you have read Drs Jackson, Jumper or Soons or Ray Downing’s detailed accounts, you have really understood them.

I have carried out extensive research into the UV characteristics of scorched linen myself, corresponded in detail with Colin and Thibault, and deeply respect their ongoing research into the subject.That, however, was not your point. You asked for evidence for two things, which has been provided with speed, clarity and abundance.1) Can I demonstrate that the shroud is not a hologram? Yes I can, and have done.2) Can I demonstrate any image at all that shows a similar 2D-3D convertibility to the Shroud. Yes I can, and have done.There is no doubt that the Shroud is a unique object. It shows an image of Christ that is to mind superior to that of, say, Michaelangelo’s Pieta, Da Vinci’s Last Supper, Della Francesca’s Baptism, the Byzantine Pantocrators or any of the 20th Century images, including Ray Downing’s “Real Face of Jesus” or Akiane Kramarik’s paintings. That in itself could be evidence of a miraculous origin, and I would respect anybody who thought it so. As daveb reminded us a little while ago, the Shroud’s chief interest to Christians is as an icon of the almighty, and a very fine one it is too. It can justify its existence perfectly well without being wrapped up in para-scientific generalisations or mumbo-jumbo such as “holographic 3D quantum matrix” which means nothing at all. Beyond that, it’s a cloth, with an image, of unknown age, provenance and manufacture. These qualities can be investigated forensically.

I have already said that when analysed by a 3D interpreter such as the VP-8 or ImageJ, the Shroud image can be converted to what looks like a bas relief of a face, where the nose and forehead appear more prominent than the eyesockets and so on. I am however very happy to disagree with you and any quote to the effect that “no other photograph contains spacial encoding when viewed under the VP-8.” The evidence is clear, unequivocal, and appears a few column inches above this comment. A scorch on a cloth, made by a heated object, photographed and analysed by 3D software reveals precise spacial encoding, and can be converted back into a 3D image of the object that made it. Exactly like the image on the Shroud. What’s more, as I have found out by myself, such an image is easily made from any object that can be sufficiently heated to produce a scorch.It may be that Pete Schumacher had never seen a scorch image, but you, now, have. You can see that Schumacher’s sweeping generalisations, such as “the Shroud image produces a three dimensional response unlike any other image so processed” is simply wrong. Yes, wrong. A scorch produces a three dimensional response very like that of the Shroud. There’s a picture of it above.Now; how will you respond to the paragraph above? By quoting, again, from Schumacher? Why? Is he somehow infallible? Please don’t. Compare the Shroud 3D and Colin Berry’s 3 yourself and explain why they are not comparable.Forgive me if I err, Todd, but it seems that you would rather accept the pontification of an “authority” over the evidence of your own eyes.

Innocent people are indeed sent to prison, and a verdict of guilty does not, of course, mean that a prisoner has actually done any of the things that he is convicted of. But the consensus of the court, and by publication, of the rest of the populace, still dooms him.Guilt or innocence, in other words, is not a statement of truth, but a statement of publicly accepted truth, based on a consensus of the evidence presented. In the same way, Joe Nickell’s “Inquest on the Shroud of Turin” and, with a nod to metaphor, Walter MccCrone’s “Judgement Day for the Shroud of Turin,” may have ‘convicted’ a first century burial cloth of being medieval. Their findings were very widely publicised and are accepted as fact by hundreds of people. On the other hand Stevenson & Habermas’s “Verdict on the Shroud of Turin” came to the opposite conclusion, and their findings (in conjunction with many others’) are also accepted as fact by hundreds. It doesn’t seem possible to determine where, of if, there is a consensus.If Nickell and McCrone are wrong, how do we overturn their verdict? If Stevenson and Habermas are wrong, how do we overturn theirs? A simple consensus of probabilities won’t do. We examine every tiny detail of their findings, and point out flaws which reduce the probability of their being correct, one by one, painstakingly, until their adherents themselves have sufficient doubt about their conviction that they reclassify it as a probability, or even as simply indeterminate.The conviction that the shroud is authentic has recently been supported on this site by comments insisting on the bigger picture, on a mass of evidence, and consensus. The balance of probabilities for these commenters does not hover around the horizontal, as it does for some of us, but crashes firmly down on one side or the other. Investigating a single tiny detail is unlikely to redress their convictions, and they have wondered why anybody would bother. However for those whose balance is more finely tuned, a single thread, (literally, probably one of Rogers’s), can affect it.We began this discussion by Charles Freeman wondering whether a stitch on the shroud was as unusual as was previously thought. It seems not. A single tiny detail. A shift in the centre of gravity. That’s what I like about studying the shroud.

The shroud is not under “trial” nor will a “verdict” make it authentic if it is a forgery, or a forgery if it is authentic. I think daveb, a model of good sense, is quite right in guessing that if there was a “trial of authenticity,” the shroud would be found “authentic,” but that will no more make it authentic than any other miscarriage of justice properly determined by a court of law. The same would apply if, after a retrial, it were found inauthentic.Scientists, surprisingly, are not keen on facts. They work with probabilities, with suggestions and difficulties, out of which a general acceptance, with reservations, gradually emerges. They explore every carp and niggle, and expose new evidence, which they immediatley attempt to discredit. The weight they give to each piece of evidence is often largely subjective, which is why they can differ quite markedly, even from exactly the same evidence, if they’re forced to come to a conclusion.I don’t think I have ever claimed that the shroud must be a forgery because of such-and-such, or that it must be authentic because of something-else. For many years I have teetered around the 50/50, sometimes thinking there was 60/40 chance the shroud is genuine, and sometimes thinking the reverse. But a 60/40 chance is not a conviction of authenticity, nor is the reverse a conviction of forgery. A scientific fact is not achieved “beyond reasonable doubt” but beyond any doubt at all: that’s why there are so few of them.So, by all means believe the shroud genuine or fake, according to your convictions, but if you believe it fake, keep those halophytes in the back of your mind, and if you believe it real, do the same with my 610nm spike, and remember that “they can’t show how it was made” cannot be twisted into “therefore it must be authentic” any more than it can into “therefore it must be a fake.”","date":"November 30, 2013 at 1:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/30/it-may-not-suit-the-scientific-mind-set/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"It may not suit the scientific mind-set"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No no no, again! The shroud is under investigation, not under trial. At the outcome of a trial, it is not possible to deliver a verdict of “Probably,” but that is the outcome of many, many investigations. If Max Frei’s pollen findings were discredited, there would be very little to link the shroud to Jerusalem, and if the C14 dating was discredited, there would be little to link it to the 13th century. Although fanatics of either side think these points have been roundly cleared up (to their own satisfaction, of course) they are still important bones of contention.And, dear me, of course the verdict makes you guilty (or not). However innocent you be, if you’ve been properly stitched up by cleverer villains, the verdict of guilty locks you away and makes you a pariah in decent society. And conversely, however many atrocities you’ve committed, if you can afford a clever QC to persuade the jury to say ‘not guilty,” then you’re as free as any other citizen to continue on your way with your head held high.And that’s precisely the point. A verdict is a reasonable judgement, not, by any means, necessarily, a truth. And who is to decide what a reasonable judgement is, in the case of the shroud? Well, it’s every man for himself, I’m afraid. Any my verdict? “Probably” (or probably not, according to the wording of the indictment).Scientists do not explore every carp and niggle? Nonsense, again. They do not explore every tiny detail, perhaps, but if there is a carp against their findings, or a niggling inconsistency, then yes, getting to the bottom of every one is crucial to the publication of their findings, and occasionally pointed out (with glee) by their peers. Failing to respond to objections, or brushing them aside as irrelevant (unless they are) is a short cut to ignominy.And finally: “The point is not an individual judgment concerning one fact or another but a collective consensus concerning a viable constellation of facts.” What on earth does this mean? The point of what? Of my investigations? Not at all. Of yours? Scientific truths are not collective consensuses of viable facts. Legal truths are. A legal truth can be overturned, and often is, on appeal. A real truth can’t be. If the shroud is a 13th century fake, then no amount of consensus can make it authentic, and if it’s genuine, then none can make it false. It is not up to a committee to decide.

Daniel McKinley (Pinna and her Silken Beard: A Foray into Historical Misappropriations) does a lot to dispel the mythology that has grown up around it (particularly with reference to transparency in ancient textiles), albeit without reference to Manoppello, and Jaworski (The Properties of Byssal Threads, the Chemical Nature of their Colours, and the Veil of Manoppello) has examined byssal threads in great detail, and found compelling similarities between them and reported observations of the Manoppello veil, but still concludes that Giulio Fanti is probably correct in saying that the fabric is probably linen. A compendium of surviving specimens of nineteenth century byssus is being compiled in Switzerland, virtually none of which are woven, knitting or crotcheting being the dominant method of manufacture. Although I have not seen any painted specimens, that may be more to do with the deep golden brown colour of the fabric than because it is ‘impossible to paint.’ Jaworski found that the fibres were hydrophobic, but that microgranules of colour remained on the surface of fibres which he tried to paint with watercolour. Perhaps a light oil would work better. Also, I don’t think byssus is particularly fragile. It is very susceptible to insects, which is probably why there are no ancient examples to be found, but seems to have been used for gloves and stockings in some abundance, for which a reasonably sturdy material is essential. The fibres are reported as being an average of 25um (Jaworski) or 14um (Fanti) in diameter, which is much thicker than silk, and Fanti reported a thread thickness of 120 um, which is comparable to the linen thread thickness of the Shroud.","date":"September 3, 2014 at 1:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/02/manoppello-shroud-and-durer-a-short-presentation-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Manoppello, Shroud and Durer:  A Short Presentation by O.K."},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Calling people fools tells the reader, I think, more about the character of the caller than that of the called.","date":"September 25, 2014 at 10:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/25/mars-weeping-mary-and-the-shroud/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Mars, Weeping Mary and the Shroud"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“And the cause of science is not advanced by “scientists” who attack a particular religious belief without doing the science.” In response to my challenge, Mr Klotz named two: Carl Sagan and Richard Dawkins. To the best of my knowledge Sagan did not attack belief in authenticity of the shroud at all. In a radio interview on YouTube he admitted having respect for Walter McCrone, but, not having read anything else about the Shroud, did not commit himself to any particular viewpoint, and certainly did not attack any religious belief. Richard Dawkins, on the other hand, has spent a lot of time and energy “doing the science” and come to the mistaken conclusion that God does not exist. This is not a “particular religious belief,” but a general attack on the whole ideology. The cause of science is certainly not advanced by this view – and in fact such was the naivity of The God Delusion that the cause of religion was rather strengthened by it – but it has little to do with the Shroud. This was mentioned in his book The Greatest Show On Earth, in connection with radiocarbon dating, which, “doing the science,” he accepted. However he also accepted that the date could be wrong. “The dating of the shroud remains controversial … For example, the carbon in the shroud might have been contaminated by a fire.” This is not an “attack” on “a particular religious belief without doing the science.”So, as far as I can discover – and please quote chapter and verse if I’m wrong – neither Carl Sagan nor Richard Dawkins have attacked belief in the authenticity in the Shroud. Furthermore, such a belief is not, for most people, a religious belief anyway, but a conclusion derived from evidence.After calling me a fool, Mr Klotz now finds my careful exposition of his nonsense insulting. I can’t think why. As I’m sure King David would agree, not all fools deny the existence of God, many of them are his most devoted servants. And yes, being a Catholic school, the bible is quoted frequently here. “Love those who hate you” is a favourite…Details about Shirley Anne Martin are readily available on the internet as reports in numerous papers.

The complexity of reality was discovered and exposed by rationalists, not denied by them. A truly dogged agnostic would not write anything off as a hoax; that would be a rejection of his agnosticism. In 1949 11-year old Shirley Anne Martin made tears come from the eyes of the broken head of a statue of St Ann for a couple of days. There were no weeks or months of hysterical viewings, although she did appear on television demonstrating her ability.“Anyone, who dismisses the Shroud image as other than an image of a horribly tortured, crucified man that was by all probability created within three days of his death, is a fool whatever his credentials. Science demonstrates that it IS.” I thought we’d grown out of this childish insult-throwing by now. Science has opened many lines of investigation into the Shroud, but closed very few. It has certainly not conclusively demonstrated that the Shroud is authentic.“And the cause of science is not advanced by “scientists” who attack a particular religious belief without doing the science.” Can Mr Klotz name any of these “scientists” and their attacks? Which religious belief does he think has been attacked in the absence of “doing the science?” Does he think belief in the authenticity of the Shroud is a religious belief? Does he think rejection of its authenticity must be a rejection of religion?“In the case of climate change, the atheists and agnostics who proselytize for atheism instead of sticking to scince, are as big a danger as those who are driven to reject scientific proof by the arrogance of some scientists.

If anything, 1st century cubits were considerably smaller than Assyrian ones. Jones, quoting Dickinson, says “a particular cubit of the market place that is connected with the Shroud, the cubit that is known as the Assyrian cubit: the widely used, indeed, international standard of that time for merchants of the Near East, and had been so for centuries.” I can find no evidence for this at all.

I do not for a moment suppose that the apearance of the image on the shroud was a freak combination of circumstances wholly unrelated to its subject, such as those wonderful cloud formations and pieces of pizza that turn up on the web every so often, but I do think that the image as we see it now was probably not what its creator intended. I think it likely that there was something on the shroud, possibly a pigment of some kind, possibly even material glued in place, which has come off, leaving the image we see today. It could have been scorched by a bas relief, either when it was heated (although I find it hard to think that could have been wholly inadvertent), or when a protective covering of paint or varnish or cleaning material or preservative made contact with the cloth. The concept of the volkringer image has occsionally been brought up, in which context you might like to peruse this: http://imgur.com/9taZ8vg, which is the tissue-paper protective covering to one of the plates in my (electronic) copy of Vignon’s 1902 book, the Shroud of Christ. Some of the burn-hole pattern is clearly visible – by accident.There are plenty of authenticists who also think the shroud is an accident, an unintended consequence of the circumstances surrounding the entombment of Jesus.

Jones thinks that the Shroud did spend some time in the marked Montfort, but in 1358-1359, after which it moved to Anthon. However he gives no reference for this. The root of the various discussions regarding the Shroud’s movement at this time seems to be M. Bergeret’s Ohio Conference paper on ‘Linceul de Turin – Le Trou Historique’ which says that the Shroud moved to Montfort in 1360 and stayed there till 1389, and Dorothy Crispino’s ‘To know the Truth’ which says that it may have moved directly to Anthon in 1357 and stayed there till 1388.

The minerals in the blood are in widely different proportions from modern human blood. But (according to Chan) Dr Linoli uses all this to conclude that this is evidence for miraculous preservation.There has been no attempt to carbon date these relics, and no particular reason to suppose that they date back more than the time needed to shrivel up a piece of meat into its present state. Having done that, I dare say they might remain in that state for a very long time, but there’s no obvious evidence that they have.There are five (solid) globules of blood, which are supposed to be all different sizes but exactly the same masses, according to the Miracle Rosary Mission (at http://www.miraclerosarymission.org/lanciano.html).

Forensically, however, one must not begin with that assumption, and Heller & Adler do not make such as assumption in the paper “A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin.” Their contention there can be simplified (fairly drastically) as follows: There are three colours of fibre on the shroud, white, yellow and red, corresponding to non-image, image, and blood. When these three colours of fibre are tested with protease (to dissolve any animal trace), the white remains unchanged, the yellow remains unchanged, and the red disappears and becomes white. This implies that only the red derives from animals, and that there is no yellow underneath it. So far, so good.However, observing the shroud in close up, one can see that on the whole image fibres are on the top of the middle of each exposed thread, while the most bloodstained fibres are found most heavily down the sides of the same thread. In other words, image fibres and bloodstain fibres do not closely coincide, even on quite heavily bloodstained patches. The reason for this is that the blood has mostly eroded away, leaving the image behind. It seems to me quite probable that, in selecting well-blood-stained fibres for testing, Heller and Adler unwittingly selected fibres that, although they came from an image-bearing part of the shroud, actually bore no image.Look, for example, at the bloodstains over the right eye (on shroudscope, for example). There is the famous epsilon, and further to the side a single dark smudge. Between these two are a couple of rather poorly defined bloodmarks. All of them are characterised by pale diagonal stripes, which represent the tops of the threads running through them. The blood is clearly found mainly in the cracks down the side. Are we to understand that all these threads running right through the bloodstains actually contain no image?  I don’t think there is any evidence for that.","date":"October 7, 2013 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"No, Max, I make no assumptions at all.

A wide variety of themes to address while I’ve been off the air. Let’s see…1) I’m very familiar with Rogers’s FAQ paper. It is deliberately fairly simplistic in tone, and addressed to people who want to understand his conclusions rather than to people who already understand them and don’t necessarily agree. Nearly every question, beginning “How do you know…” would be better begun with “Why do you think…” Many of his own beliefs are presented as fact with little or no corroboration, and several diagrams presented as if what they showed was obvious, when in fact it isn’t. For example the reflectance spectrograph labelled “image”,  “blood” and “Fe2O3” shows a reflectance spectrum for blood that only barely resembles it, and the photo purporting to be a UV image of the sample area shows a bright spot for the Raes area which appears to be a retouching and looks nothing like any of the UV photos of Miller and Pellicori. While I agree with many of Rogers’s ideas, there are many I do not agree with, and none that are wholly uncontentious.2) There are no Roman flagra in existence for us to copy, and the only two (quite different) examples used to verify the whip marks of the shroud were modelled using those very whip marks. Hardly surprising they match. Remarkably, the only reference to an archaeological find shows a flagrum made entirely, handle, thongs and plumbata, of metal. This find no longer seems to be in existence. There are a few illustrations, on coins and such, but they only go to demonstrate that there was a wide variety of designs. To claim that the shroud matches any of them is mere speculation. The only actual whippings with which one might compare the Shroud are carried out annually in Mexico and the Philippines, and they look nothing like the Shroud.3) Do I think the Shroud was modelled on the Pray manuscript? No.4) The Stuttgart Psalter is wonderful and I’m so glad Max mentioned it. It can be found in its entirety at http://digital.wlb-stuttgart.de/digitale-sammlungen/seitenansicht/?no_cache=1&tx_dlf%5Bid%5D=1517&tx_dlf%5Bpage%5D=1 and does indeed have a picture of a naked Christ being flogged.

Hiss! Enter the pantomime sceptic, twirling his black moustaches! Brothers, it was me. I think the evidence that there is no image under the bloodstains is very weak. It is certainly not apparent just by looking at the shroud, either from a distance or in close-up. There do appear to be places where the blood has worn off, and the colour of the shroud in those places is not noticeably paler than adjacent non-blood areas, imaged or not. Early examination suggested that the image was formed by corrosion of the upper surfaces of fibres, and that no corrosion was observed under the bloodstains. This might be compelling if it was quantified, and the places where the various corroded/non-corroded fibres were taken from was clear, or even if clear comparison photographs were available. I have not seen any such evidence myself. Later, it was suggested that the image was not formed on the fibres of the shroud at all, but on an impurity layer which covered the whole shroud. This rather damages the finding of the corroded/non-corroded fibres, which, by the new hypothesis, should not have occurred at all.","date":"October 6, 2013 at 6:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"My remarks were a specific reply to “Can you really paint the mirror image of a flagrum having impacted human flesh on a linen?”  It is often said that a) the marks on the shroud fit the design of a Roman flagrum perfectly, and b) no artist could have matched the injuries due to a Roman flagrum. As there is no evidence as to the precise nature of either the instrument which made them or the injuries it inflicted, artists can do more or less what they like. For all anyone knows the marks on the shroud look nothing like genuine flagrum marks, and were dabbed on with a piece of sponge. If we must speculate about either the instrument or the injuries, then it is relevant that the only flagrum ever found, and the only wounds due to flagellation we can examine, bear no relation to the marks on the shroud. Wilson’s flagrum was made specifically to fit the injuries on the shroud, and has no archaeological justification. William Smith’s illustration would not produce the marks, nor would the knucklebones he also mentions. He derives his information about the flagrum found in Herculaneum from Rich’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, where it is illustrated. Of course all these genuine classical descriptions predate the popularity of the shroud – that’s why they didn’t feel any urge to conform to it, unlike most descriptions of flagra since.

The half-tone effect is very clear, with more or fewer coloured fibres per thread giving a lighter or darker image, and some fibres carry the image through to the other side of the sheet, but the 3D effect is so muddled by variations in pressure and ‘ink’ density at any particular place that the overall result is very un-shroudlike.2) Soaking material in cornflour starch, rinsing and allowing it to dry, then pressing a hot template into it does not make a noticeable difference in colour from using untreated linen. Pressing sellotape hard over scorched material and peeling it off does not noticeably diminish the image, and I find no trace of removeable coating on the sellotape (although there is a fair amount of particulate matter). When you press sellotape over cloth and pull it off, the contact area remains in the sellotape as a regular pattern of deformed patches in the glue, basically a mould of the cloth. It was presumably on the inside of this mould that Rogers observed his discolouration layer, but I wonder how he knew that the fibre from which it came was now clear and colourless.Do you know if there are any photos of any of the slides of sellotape at, say, 25X magnification?

With these four specimens soaked for ten minutes, lightly rinsed and dried, I heated individual spatulas (so they all started the same temperature) in a flame for a measured 10 seconds, and then applied them for 5 seconds to my cloths. The custard cloth scorched about as well as untreated linen, the others more so, especially the potassium hydroxide one. All of them fluoresced. All showed more marked scorching of the upper fibres of each thread, and all transmitted some discolouration on the reverse of the cloth. So far so good.However, thinking about a purely surface layer of degraded carbohydrate led me to a bottle of gravy browning, with ingredients: Water, Ammonia Caramel, Salt, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum and Potassium Sorbate, all good healthy ingredients that shouldn’t upset anybody’s spectrographic analysis. It’s a thickish goo, so I dipped one finger in, wiped it on a finger of the other hand, and dabbed a sample of linen. Brilliant. Discolouration only of individual fibres, darker in the middle where pressure is greatest and more fibres were touched, lighter at the edges where only a few fibres received a slight grazing. Some individual fibres conducted the colour along their length and round to the back of the cloth.This result led me to re-thinking painting. Leaving aside the stylistic arguments, everybody seems to be agreed that no artist could have painted the cloth, as the medium would have soaked through, the paint particles would be conspicuous and it would have been impossible for him to paint individual fibres, leaving others completely untouched. This is not necessarily true. Get a felt-tipped pen and scribble lightly on some cloth, or a finger wiped with goo and dab on it, and look (under a 25X microscope) at what turns up. For a start individual fibres take the colour, and some are not touched, for a second the medium doesn’t soak from fibre to fibre, but along fibres (which is how the colour turns up on the other side), and even under 400X, the particles responsible for the colour cannot be seen (I think I did see salt crystals).A finger, of course, is not a good way of testing the “photographic negative” or the “3d information” aspects of the image, but watch this space…I’m not keen on gas diffusion, and am more convinced by physical contact. However there do seem to be at least two aspects to the image which must be derived from it, the direct, upper-surface degradation and the indirect, whole-fibre degradation (much paler). Scorches of various kinds, sufficiently controlled, seem to be able to provide this, but if we postulate some sort of chemical carbohydrate-based pre-treatment of the linen, a layer which degrades when the image is formed, why not also image a layer, transferred by contact, which has already degraded (basically caramel)?Although I’m still doubtful about any of these coatings, it would be interesting to find out if the non-image fibres had the same sort of coating that Rogers thinks is present on the image, but in an un-degraded form.","date":"October 25, 2012 at 4:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Refining a model: children’s ‘invisible ink’ trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (“scorching”) at a much reduced temperature"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"That’s an interesting analysis and food for thought.It’s not impossible that Jesus carried a complete cross, but I do not find OK’s analysis particularly convincing. It may be true that the execution equipment was not left on-site – and Glori’s suggestions seem quite sensible in that respect – but that does not mean that the condemned criminal carried a completely constructed cross. There are a couple of reasons for this.Firstly I have myself carried such a cross a number of times, the distance (about 700m) between the Catholic and Anglican churches on my parish as part of the Good Friday ‘Walk of Witness’ and I think I can say with some authority that the crosspiece is always in front of the body and never makes contact with the back at all. OK’s diagram which seems to show the whole cross strapped to the back is wholly unrealistic. What’s more, given its length, the cross presses on the top of the shoulders and does not abrade the shoulderblades.Secondly, my cross consisted of two pieces of wood of equal cross-section joined by a cross-halved joint. If this is not done, then the cross-piece would either be simply nailed directly across the upright, or have a mortice cut out for a tenon in the upright to fit in. In the first case it would be very difficult to stand the completed cross up with a body hanging on it (the Good Thief’s beam looks like this), and in the second the crossbeam would have to be much thicker than suggested (maybe 15cm or so) to accommodate both the tenon. Also I would certainly not assume the upright had a circular cross-section; the crossbeam would be impossible to attach securely.As to weight, my cross was made of 6″ x 4″ (15cm x 10cm) pine and weighed about 50kg. However, I only carried it; I don’t know how stable such a narrow cross would be to hang a victim on.","date":"March 14, 2015 at 9:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hey Ho, I’m off to buy a lemon.

He agrees that earthquakes and radon are unlikely to be the cause, and stops short of “therefore it must be a miracle” for which I applaud him, although he needs now to demonstrate that ball lightning (his favoured explanation) can have the appropriate effect.The other paper, however “The Physics of Resurrection” is gibberish.

The risen body of Jesus was not infinitely massive, for a start (or consider the effect on the gravity of the earth!).

It’s an expression I use quite often. I suppose that if we start with the results of a thermal decomposition of a cloth, defining them as a ‘scorch,’ then the results of any other process which produces exactly the same result could also be termed scorches, whether they be by sulphuric acid (chemical scorch), laser beams (radiation scorch), or a process wholly outside science (miracle scorch). The point would be that it would be impossible to tell, just by looking at the chemical changes to the cloth, which of these processes had resulted in the scorch. We must then look at the physical aspects of the ‘scorch’ to attempt to understand it. It appears only on the outer crowns of the threads, it appears to be of all-or-nothing intensity, and it appears to be only a few nanometres thick. There are good reasons for supposing that both vapour and radiation would discolour more than just the outer crowns of the threads (although the threshold intensity stochastic theory attempts to get round this) and some evidence to suggest that any thermal treatment sufficient to discolour the outer surfaces of the linen fibres would also darken the surface of the lumen as well.

If it was the reason for all the correspondence, it is curious that it is not mentioned. Even in his memorandum, Bishop d’Arcis says nothing of Geoffrey I de Charny having been connected with it all, claiming that the Dean of the church was the man who had procured it. Surely de Charny knew about it, so why didn’t d’Arcis mention him? The family only come in for their share of criticism for allowing the second series of expositions to which d’Arcis took exception, and even then, he grudgingly admits that they themselves do not claim the Shroud is anything more than a representation. The two versions of the pilgrim medallion, with the switched positions of their shields, certainly suggest a dynastic change such as the death of the first de Charny, so that dating the earlier to 1355 or before seems justified, and the very presence of the shields suggests a Charny imprimatur. It does not necessarily mean that he found, was given or inherited the Shroud himself. Geoffrey II, of whom d’Arcis is critical, seems to disappear from Shroud connections very soon after d’Arcis’ complaint. The effigy of him in the Wikipedia article about his father seems to stem from Ian Wilson’s discovery of it in “Monuments français inédits pour servir à l’histoire des arts” (http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1087131/f4.image), Plate 125, captioned: “Tombe de messire Geoffroy de Charny, mort l’an 1398. (ancienne abbaye de Froidmont, près Beauvais).” However, Froidmont is nowhere near Troyes, Lirey or Savoie, and, in spite of Wilson’s identification, there is no way the shields dotted about his body can be interpreted as “Gules three escutcheons argent”, the arms attributed by Froissart to Geoffroi I de Charny. In short, I don’t think this Charny is closely related at all. Dorothy Crispino (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi18part6.pdf) notes that there is a town – and associated family – called Charny in Yonne, near Thory, but decides “There was no relationship between these and the Charny of the Côte d’Or, from which Geoffroy took his cognomen.”","date":"May 31, 2015 at 6:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/31/screwy-1-crazy-2-ludicrously-odd-or-inappropriate/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"screw·y  1. crazy. 2. ludicrously odd, or inappropriate."},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"As I replied in another post, I have tried.

Although there were fewer of these, they still lacked consistency. Some being bearded and some not.3) Round about 450AD the Statue of Zeus at Olympia was moved to Constantinople.4) After its destruction in 475AD, images of Jesus increasingly began to resemble it, in spite of at least one bishop claiming it was heresy to make Jesus resemble Zeus.5) Nevertheless, the Byzantine influence won, and beardless acheiropoieta went out of fashion.6) Several hundred years later, a ‘resurrection event’ was staged in Constantinople, consisting of a long cloth that emerged vertically from a mock-up tomb. The cloth was painted to resemble an image left on a shroud, following the conventions of the Passion Story, that Jesus was Flogged, Crowned, Stripped, Crucified, Speared and Entombed. All these elements were included, with the hands modestly covering the image’s nakedness. The face, of course, resembled the Zeus face that had already become standard.7) This new, full-length, image became so famous that it too became a standard form, and was immediately copied by Hungarians and whoever, sometimes adapting the image to suit local conditions.8) Either this image, or the nearest that could be found to a replica, became the Shroud of Turin.I don’t think this account is necessarily true, but it would act as a counterbalance to the Agbar-Edessa-Mandylion-Shroud account, and I think I could make it difficult for a balanced jury to decide on their verdict, even if they did come down on one side or the other in the end!","date":"March 17, 2013 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/shroudie-alert-day-12-time-now-to-write-that-long-overdue-letter-to-the-royal-society/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Shroudie-Alert: Day 12: time now to write that long-overdue letter to the Royal Society…"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Possibly.

Still, here we go.1. If it’s a fake why hasn’t anyone–even with modern technology–been able to reproduce it? — This question is identical to “If it’s real why hasn’t anyone–even with modern technology–been able to reproduce it?” Ignorance is not dispelled by an appeal to the supernatural.2. How did the forger not only know about photography in the Middle Ages, but manage to produce what is, in effect, a photographic negative? — The photographic negative effect would be an inevitable consequence of any kind of image formation, 1st, 13th or any other century, which depended on a chemical, radiation, or plain painting technique in which parts of a body closer to a supposed surface were rendered darker than those further away. 3. The image is not painted, but “singed” or burnt on to the fabric. How did they do that?— “They” or possibly “God” did it by degrading the linen fibres. I don’t know how, but Ignorance is not dispelled by an appeal to the supernatural.4. The “burned” image doesn’t penetrate more than the surface level of the cloth. Paint would soak in wouldn’t it? — Not if it was very thick, or powdered on, or if the image is not a painting but formed by degradation of an existing substrate. (Incidentally, if you assert in Question 3 that the image is not painted, why do you raise the irrelevance of what would happen if it was?)5. When paintings are put into a 3-D replicator they don’t produce successful 3-D images. This does. How did the forger do that? — Any painting or photograph taken full-face, with front lighting and a dark background, reproduces the 3-D effect as least as well as the shroud, and sometimes better.6.  They found pollen and traces of soil from the area of Jerusalem. Did a medieval forger in Europe think of that and travel out there to get samples? — Even if your overconfident assertion is true, a forger might have had access to a cloth stolen during the crusades from Jerusalem, Constantinople and all points between, or the pollen could have arrived subsequently from reverent pilgrims pressing their own relics against the shroud.7. Are carbon 14 dating tests ever wrong? We’re assuming someone in the Middle Ages was a fraud. What if the modern scientists cheated? Its possible isn’t it? — Carbon 14 dating tests are always wrong, and have to be carefully calibrated to produce results which conform to other factors relevant to the date of an artifact. Yes, it’s possible that modern scientists cheated; even in the 13th century the world was full of clever people trying to fool others in one way or another.8. The man in the shroud was nailed through the wrists. Medieval artists showed Christ’s nails through his hands. How did the medieval forger know that the Romans nailed through the wrist and not the hand as people thought back in the Middle Ages? — No Roman skeleton, image or literature has ever been found that shows clearly where nails were targeted, and, although some pathologists (notably Barbet) demonstrated that nails through the palms would tear out, others (notably Zugibe) disagreed. If the victim were sitting or standing on some kind of rest the anatomical relevance disappears. Still others think the nails may have gone in through the palm of the hand and come out through the wrist. Although mediaeval painters were not necessarily anatomists, there are several examples which do show wrist wounds.9. The forger even got the details of the wounds correct because the flagellation wounds correspond not only to Roman flagella, but to the direction from which the two men would have whipped the victim according to Roman torture techniques. How did the forger know that? — Whips through the ages don’t seem to have changed much, and it does not take much imagination to guess that there might have been two scourgers, in which case one on either side is a rather obvious configuration. Specific details of “Roman torture techniques,” although much guessed at, are not archaeologically or paleographically verifiable.10. The pigtail at the back? It links up with the hair style of Jewish men who had taken the “Nazarite vow” in the time of Christ. This was some fantastic forger no? — The details of the Nazirite lifestyle are in the Bible. Apart from not cutting his hair, the Nazirite took a vow of abstaining from anything derived from grapes, including juice, wine, vinegar, raisins and the grapes themselves. It is fairly obvious that Jesus was not a Nazirite. Whether long hair was normal among non-Nazirites is often discussed, as St Paul seems to dislike it. I believe the idea that Jesus may have been a Nazirite started because of the lack of archaeological evidence for anywhere called Nazareth, although recently I think even this has been modified somewhat. Whether there is any semantic connection between the words Nazirite and Nazareth (and Nazarene, for that matter) is also discussed, but I think has been largely rejected.","date":"April 2, 2013 at 6:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/02/ten-questions-for-shroud-skeptics-from-fr-longenecker/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Ten Questions for Shroud Skeptics from Fr. Longenecker"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"As usual daveb adds the voice of impeccable reason to my histrionics. I think my overall point remains valid though. So many people begin with “If it’s a fake why hasn’t anyone reproduced it?” as if that was per se an argument for authenticity. The fact that it hasn’t been explained, whether its a fake or not, is not an argument for anything, unless one has recourse to the supernatural (and therefore by definition inexplicable naturally). There are plenty of good reasons for opting for authenticity, but not being able to explain how the image arose is not one of them.I agree that the concept of the negative image was probably beyond people in the 13th century, although some paintings age to produce an interesting solarised effect with which some people might have been familiar. But that’s not the point. If someone aimed at a “the closer the darker” effect, which is an easy concept to imagine, then a negative effect would be an inevitable consequence, whether the image maker knew about it or not.The powder thing. Wasn’t that Joe Nicholls’s idea? I don’t think it’s new. Again, my point is that the answer to the bald question “paint would soak in, wouldn’t it?” argument (expecting the answer yes) is actually, no.The 3D effect (response to anoxie too). I’ll email Dan some screen grabs from ImageJ. They’re not brilliant – but then neither is the shroud, and they certainly show the effect.The sheet pre-sown with pollen and powder. Again, the forger didn’t have to know anything about it; if he used a sheet ransacked from the crusades, the pollen and powder might be there already. Actually, if Frie and friends are correct about the pollen coming from several very specific places around the middle east then that would be a very lucky choice of sheet indeed but then, as I say, pilgrims pressing their souvenirs against the shroud could also be a source.I don’t subscribe to the “dishonest 20th century scientists” hypothesis. I simply agree that it’s possible. Like the “dishonest 13th century forger” hypothesis.The nails. Well I surrender completely here. The two examples I was thinking of (one in a Tres Riches Heures) and another in Assisi) turn out to be 14th century and conceivably based on the shroud. Both have no thumbs, and only three fingers on one hand!Well, it’s been an interesting search. Are you familiar with artbible.net?

My own guess is that for at least most of its length the side-strip seam is merely a tuck along the length of the cloth, possibly for strengthening. I know that Raes’s little bit fell apart into two pieces, but the absolute integrity of the continuity of most of the weft threads looks too good for the rematching of two pieces of cloth to me. As for Flury-Lemberg’s idea, I can’t get any practical sense out of it. Why start with the wrong width? Cloth was made in all sorts of widths, and there was no need for a Shroud to have an exact width anyway. Did Joesph of Arimathea decide his cloth was too wide and hurriedly cut it up and resew, just to get the selvedges right? Or did cloth merchants regularly buy cloth of a single width and cut it to size? If they did, why cut a strip out of the middle and end up with four cut edges, two of which would have to be sewn together (to make the shroud) and the other two (of the detached strip) hemmed. Or did they throw the middle strip away? Surely not. Why not simply cut it to the correct width and hem the two cut edges, giving you two strips of cloth?

Beyond that, I think it is dangerous to be too prescriptive. Looms all over the world are often just over a metre wide and always have been, that being a convenient distance to throw a shuttle from one side to the other. Being under a certain amount of tension while being woven, cloth tends to shrink from its loom-size, but can of course, easily be stretched. A glance at the Shroud shows that it now has quite deeply embowed ends, so where its precise ‘length’ is measured ought to be stated. The long period when the Shroud was stored rolled up resulted in its being quite badly creased (and so shortened), and it has now been stretched out again. Jones does not seem to have noticed more recent estimates of its length. Between 435 and 443 cm seems a fair estimate of its length, give or take a couple of centimetres, and 110 to 114 cm for its width. Stephen Jones’s usual dogmatism must, as usual, be treated with caution.The thickness was measured with a micrometre by John Jackson and Ray Rogers in three places, giving between 323 and 367 micrometres, which Jones refers to accurately, but the weight (“about 2.45 kg”) is much more speculative. As it has never been weighed, estimates have been based on the known areal density of other linen cloths, or calculated by Morris, Schwalbe and London using some questionable assumptions from the Compton scatter of their X-Ray experiments, or extrapolated from the weight of tiny fragments given to Raes or the radiocarbon laboratories. Something between 20 and 30mg/cm2 seems roughly right, or a maximum of about 1.5 kg for the Shroud. Jones’s 2.45 kg comes from Iannone, but I have no access to his book – does anyone know where he gets his figure from?With all this uncertainty, it may be thought that any attempt to equate the Shroud’s measurements to any supposed antique ‘standard’ such as the Assyrian cubit is futile, but on this site we never let a little thing like that prevent exhaustive inquiry. This cubit business was well explored in “The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits” (November 18, 2013). Briefly, there is no evidence of an international standard cubit in use in the 1st century Jerusalem market place, and only wishful thinking to suggest there might have been. Measurements by various eminent archaeologists of various buildings, divided by appropriate numbers that seem likely, have given a range of possible cubits in use at different places and times, and a very few actual rulers have been found, and sure enough, some of the cubits have been found to be about half the width of the Shroud. However, Jones’s conclusion: “So even the dimensions of the Shroud of Turin are among the many proofs beyond reasonable doubt that it is authentic,” is wholly unjustified.Finally, the whole doubled in four thing is such peculiar special pleading as hardly to merit comment. I think it may just be etymologically possible to use tetradiplon as a description for a cloth folded to leave only the face (one eighth) exposed, but the bizarre attempt to achieve it by zig-zag folding the rest of the cloth behind the face in the manner illustrated is unconvincing.","date":"September 8, 2014 at 4:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/08/the-length-and-width-of-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Length and Width of It"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m not sure I would dignify my tuck suggestion as a theory just yet, it’s just that the idea of cutting a thin sliver out of a cloth just to centre the image seems so impractical.

I speculated that the seam had four layers of cloth folded down onto the visible surface; Wilson’s diagram shows three layers, perhaps 2cm. If (remember all those ‘ifs’) the original width was 117cm and the new width is 114cm, then a sliver only 1cm wide was removed. Even if the new width is 111cm, then the sliver would only be 4cm wide. This seems to me wholly impractical.

The exact difference is 3.5cm. If three layers of seam were envisaged, then a minimum of 1.5 cm should be deducted from the width of the extracted sliver, leaving 2cm to be removed. This seems unresonable to me. If the difference was 6.2cm, then leaving 1.5cm for the seam gives a cut-strip width of 4.7 cm. This does not seem to me much more resonable. If you actually cut off a strip 6.2 cm, and then used 1.5 cm of the remaining pieces for the re-join, the result would be a narrowing of 7.7 cm.You’re right about Wilson’s diagram.

In other words there are no historical sources regarding the carrying of the patibulum at all. What’s more, C.M. Glori, at http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/GloriWeb.pdf, rather elegantly demonstrates that the alleged bruise marks on the shoulder blades of the shroud could not have been made by carrying the patibulum after all. They could, perhaps, have been made by dragging a heavy beam along, held over the shoulder, and switching from one to the other for relief.“It was also part of Roman crucifixion that the victim was made to carry his cross naked through the streets to the site of his execution[8], but as a concession to Jewish morality, Jesus was given back his clothes after being scourged (Mt 27:31; Mk 15:20)[9].” The reference here is to Fr Werner Bulst’s “On the Shroud of Turin.” Alas, I do not have this book.

However, without independent qualification, we cannot be sure that we are not reconstructing a medieval version of crucifixion, and not a Roman one at all.Walked naked throught the street? – No evidence for that, I believe.Crucified naked? – Well, I can’t find evidence for that either, much to my surprise.Carried the patibulum? – I’ve found “patibulum ferat per urbem, deinde offigatur cruci,” which seems to be one of only three lines preserved from a lost play of Plautus, and recorded by the 10th century linguist Nonnius Marcellus. Indicative rather than definitive, I would say.Nails through wrists? – The only victim found has some disputed scratches on an armbone, some way from the wrists. There would be no danger of tearing if the victim sat on a sedile or stood on a suppedaneum (as in one of the grafitti).Nails through feet? – The only victim found has them through the sides of the feet, as does one of the grafitti. The other has the two feet side by side not on top of each other.Broken legs? – The crurifragium features relatively often in classical literature, but was clearly not invariable, especially if a plolonged death was required.Spear? – Quintilian is often quoted here, in his Declamationes Maiores, where he has a character claiming that cruxifixion victims who have been pierced may be buried. Not that others may not be. Again, indicative rather than definitive, I would say.Now, go back to those confident statements claiming that the shroud conforms exactly to a first century Roman crucifixion.

Frei’s studies are ” wildly inaccurate”, his pollen was  “forcibly madeto match a probable geographic origin”, and his conclusions are “partial and ambiguous.” One after another, even after giving it initial credence, anybody who examines the pollen data finds it too anomalous to be acceptable as any kind of evidence.Daveb makes an interesting comment. “We end up with yet another unsatisfactory situation, apparently having put all our trust in those with a claim to know the science, but apparently who knew a lot less than they thought they did.” Without wishing to be dismissive, this is the attitude of many authenticists, whose uncritical acceptance of anything which supports their belief (and, with McCrone in mind, an uncritical rejection of anything which doesn’t) has led them to come a cropper when discrepancies and uncertainties are pointed out.

Actually Carduus argentatus is widespread from Spain to Afghanistan, and the Carduus genus generally consists of nearly 100 species distributed all over Eurasia and Africa. Why Carduus argentatus would be a more attractive funeral decoration than Gundelia tournefortii escapes me. Although its leaves are less spiky than Gundelia, it is still a very awkward plant to handle, and its flower, a single typical purple thistle-flower, is not at all as pretty as Gundelia, a round head of lots of tiny yellow inflorescences.","date":"September 14, 2015 at 3:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"There may, of course, be Helichrysum on the Sudarium, but not on the Shroud, especially if neither cloth was originally from Israel.

On the whole, I am inclined to believe that the Shroud is not the authentic burial cloth of Jesus on various grounds, but biblical exegesis isn’t one of them. However, I don’t like flawed arguments wherever they occur, and although your convictions regarding the Shroud are no doubt sincere, they are based on shaky ground.“To claim that the Shroud cannot be accommodated within the Gospel texts is to deny the word of God.” Yes. The gospels describe the various cloths left in the tomb in various ways, and those ways do not exclude the Shroud. To claim that they do is to misread the gospels. This appears to be exactly what you are doing.“How can you claim the shroud as being accommodated by the word of God? What scriptures do you cite?” In my comments above I actually cited the gospel of John, which you yourself chose as an advocate against the Shroud, and demonstrated that it does not deny the possibility that Jesus was covered with a sheet.“You are saying that Jesus was not wrapped with strips of cloth but simply covered with a sheet,” Not at all. The gospel of John would support Jesus being wrapped either in strips of cloth or a sheet. Neither is precluded by the words of St John.“Why I this so important to you?” It is not important to me at all, It was a response to your airy denial of the Shroud solely on biblical grounds, which is unjustified. “Is your belief in the shroud the only source of belief in Jesus you have?” Not at all; quite the reverse. My belief in Jesus has nothing to do with this blog, but for what it’s worth, it does not rest on the authenticity or not of the Shroud.“Are you concerned that if the shroud were not authentic then you would no longer believe in Jesus?” Not at all. As a matter of fact I don’t think the Shroud is authentic. It does not affect my beliefs at all.“I am familiar with the Word of God and I know what it means.” Well no, you’re not, as we have seen. You are familiar with an English translation of the word of God, which is good enough in most cases, but if you want to demonstrate a specific and rather precise meaning, then you need to explore a little deeper.

You appear to have read one translation of one Gospel, and are clinging to that as a way of discrediting the authenticity of the Shroud. Go back to your bible and this time read what the evangelists (all of them) actually said. Matthew, Mark and Luke all use the word sindon to describe the sheet which covered Jesus. Luke uses othonia as well, for the same thing. Luke uses the word keiriais to describe the swaddlng clothes of the infant Jesus. John also uses the word keiriais, to describe the burial wrappings of Lazarus, but not for the burial wrappings of Jesus, which he calls othonia.Keiria  are thin bands of cloth – such as for swaddling clothesOthonia are wide bands of cloth – such as for stitching together to make sailsA Sindon is a sheetIn some circumstances – as used by Luke – othonion and sindon can be synonyms.Had you made any attempt to understand the Gospels as a group, you would understand that the Shroud is certainly not precluded, although it is also not positively confirmed.

Yet he did not enter. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went inside the tomb.

Whether the body was washed or not, whether it was surrounded or anointed by anything, whether the shroud was wrapped or draped, whether and especially what combination of these might have resulted in the image as we see it today have all been, often hotly, debated. For what it’s worth, I will summarise the main opinions…1) “Normally wrapped.” The precise details of 1st century Jewish burials, as applied to victims of a judicial crucifixion, in a hurry, are, of course, unknown, and leave lots of scope for variation. The paucity of archeological remains only serves to obfuscate the situation further. It seems that bodies were ‘normally’ laid in some sort of shroud (probably not a long thin one), allowed to rot away, and the bones reinterred in urns. Recovery of a relatively undamaged shroud would thus be very unlikely, which is why we don’t have any. Or any others, perhaps I should say.2) “Attempts to coat a living person.” There have been dozens, all with fairly gruesome results. Any kind of wrapping produces what is called the ‘Agamemnon mask’ distortion of the face, with the ears wide apart sticking out at the sides, the legs very thick, and the top of the head a continuous band from forehead to the back of the neck. Very few, if any, researchers think that the body-image could have been formed in that circumstance, although some people think that the blood stains were transferred while the body was wrapped, and the image arrived later, on a different configuration of the shroud. However this is not necessarily a fatal objection to authenticity. After all, the body may have been closely surrounded, even packed, by bags or blocks of ‘myrrh and aloes’ or some other concoction. The bible is at pains to point out “one hundred pounds,” which is a pretty generous dose. This might have resulted in what was essentially a bas relief, and the image would not not have extended beyond what we might call the top and bottom surfaces.Other researchers think that the image was formed by some form of emanation, either of gases, radiation or something more esoteric. Although these might be expected to spread out in all directions, if they actually only acted in a vertical direction, then again, the sides of the body would not be expected to leave an image.3) “Washed and anointed.” Here, again, prescribed Jewish ritual versus a hurried burial in a temporary tomb leaves room for uncertainty. It does appear that the body itself was not smeared with oil or anything similar, as it left no trace of the cloth, but it may have been completely washed (a sign of respect) or not washed (to preserve the blood with the body, which was, and still is, important to Judaism when the blood represents a significant quantity of the remains) or partially washed (to remove mud and clean minor wounds, but leaving the dried or clotted significant quantities undisturbed). The ‘anointing’ may have consisted of packing the body with spices, or laying flowers or more spices on the body in some places.4) “Dead bodies do not continue to bleed.” This is only partially true. As the heart stops pumping, and capillaries are thin, blood soon stops flowing through them, and the blood coagulates pretty soon anyway. However, blood inside a body stays liquid for some time, and opening a major wound, such as a nail-hole in a wrist or a spear-hole, can result in that blood falling out under gravity. Furthermore, abrasions, resulting in a loss of skin, can also remain moist for some time, and although they are unlikely to drip, at least some portion of the blood can be transferred to a cloth by contact. Try laying a piece of steak on a napkin to see what might be expected. Small but deep puncture wounds might also bleed under gravity if their surface clots were opened by a a cleaning or wiping process.It should be needless to say that none of the suggestions above constitutes a verification of the authenticity of the shroud, but they do show that the simple assumptions many take to be proof of inauthenticity are in no way to be accepted at face value.","date":"March 24, 2013 at 12:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/01/30/barrie-schwartz-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwartz on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“In 1973, the Higher Council of the World Health Organization (WHO) appointed a scientific commission to verify the Italian doctor’s conclusions.

I have gained the impression from somewhere that relic hysteria was in its heyday more like the 9th or 10th centuries, and that enthusiasm (or possibly credulousness) was waning by the time the shroud was established at Lirey. The Wikipedia article on relics says: “The growth in the production and popularity of reproducible contact relics in the fifth and sixth centuries testifies to the need felt for more widespread access to the divine,” which may represent the beginnings of the craze, and the decree of the Council of Nicea, in 787, that every altar should contain a relic may mark the beginning of the decline.

What are the chances of an object which really dates from the 1st century being carbon dated to the 13th? And what are the chances of a 13th century object being dated to the 1st? Intrinsically, the more recent an object, the smaller the error. The bones of Richard III, for example, are dated between 1475 and 1530 (a margin of plus or minus 30 years or so) with a 70% confidence rating. The two laboratories which carried out the dating came up with dates which were about 15 years apart. If a third laboratory were to be asked to carry out the task, and came up with an ancient date, there would be a strong suspicion that a major error had occurred. If the body asking this third laboratory had previously suggested a specific date, say between 100BC and 100AD, and that was the date it came up with, then a suspicion of fraud would surely not be illogical.For the reverse (an object dating from the first century producing a mediaeval date) the situation is more complicated. In the absence of any provenance, I think a confidence rating of 70% would perhaps extend to a couple of hundred years either way (Yes I’m guessing). However, if two laboratories came up with a “1st century plus or minus 200 years” and a third came up with a 13th century date, that would surely be a major error. If, as in the previous example, the body asking the third laboratory had previously suggested the possibility of 13th century date, then at least some suspicion of fraud (although significantly less than in the previous example) might be entertained.At present it cannot be said that the Turin Shroud has been definitively dated, and to my mind commenters to this blog have produced sensible objections to every single “proof” that has been adduced for any date. However, if the shroud is from the first century, then a suspicion of fraud may validly fall upon the carbon date. On the other hand, if no such suspicion of dishonesty can be entertained, then that in itself is strong evidence against a 1st century date.","date":"March 31, 2013 at 6:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I note the quad mosaic photos appearing again, with the usual explanation that the difference in colour across the shroud represents diffrence in chemical composition.

This is the principal evidence for the ‘blood-first’ hypothesis. However, Rogers’s more recent theory, that the image is wholly on a thin coating on the fibres, and not a part of the structure of the fibre itself, completely contradicts this claim. Highly respectable scientists both of them were, but their views are contradictory – one of them, at least, is wrong.And then, of course, if the image was made by laying something onto the cloth, and if that something, painting, bas relief or actual body, was painted with blood before being laid, then the blood would have suppressed image formation, and the ‘blood first’ hypothesis would be justified.","date":"February 4, 2014 at 8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/31/colin-berry-on-rogers-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Colin Berry on Rogers’ Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The 1532 fire, the silver casket and the drop of molten metal have become so ingrained in popular shroud history that any suspicion of doubt tends to be greeted with ridicule or completely ignored. Aldo Guerreschi’s comprehensive study, refuting the ‘drop of molten metal’ story, carries with it some fearsome implications which have not been followed through.Firstly, I have never read the primary source from which the story of the fire comes in the first place. I do not know if our information is contemporary, or if the first known information comes from a copy of a copy of a copy many years later. Does anybody else?Secondly, the melting point of silver is about 900°C. The melting point of iron is about 200°C hotter. It is interesting to speculate about the kind of conflagration around the “niche in the wall” which heated the casket within it to 900°C, but did not melt the iron bars holding it in place. It is also interesting to speculate about the actions of the famous blacksmith, who in the midst of this inferno popped into to rescue the shroud.Of course, the “silver” casket may not have been silver at all. Perhaps it was wooden, with silver plates or bands, and the wood burnt through, depositing the lid on the cloth. But not, apparently, any of the burning wood.I have heard it said that wrapped cloth is a remarkably good insulator, and experiments of my own with molten lead (melting point about 300°C) show how difficult it is to make a hole through more than one or two layers. However the corollary to this is that folded cloth is very easy to char on the outside, as the heat is not conducted away. Remarkably, however, the unfolded shroud shows no distinction between the inside layers and the outside layers.For two years the shroud disappears, and then requires the testimony of three bishops and ten noblemen to establish that the one which has mysteriously reappeared is the same one as disappeared two years previously. I wonder why. Wasn’t it obvious? Or were there dark suspicions that the original may in fact have been destroyed?It was then taken to a convent where it took two weeks to do what is possibly the worst patching job in recorded history.

The important thing is not to fossilise an inclination based on partial evidence into such a firm conviction that no subsequent evidence can be looked at on its own merits. If you are convinced the Shroud is genuine, then no attempt to demonstrate a medieval method of manufacture can be looked at on its own merits, and if you don’t, then no natural process in a tomb can be taken seriously. Recognising the possibility that one may be wrong is crucial, and any paper or article from either side which includes phrases such as “the only way” or “it must have been” indicate unwarranted certainty.

However, we are told that the entire shroud is ‘yellowed with age’ and ‘weakly fluorescent.’ This is consistent with the entire shroud being heated (as part of the manufacturing process before the image, or in a reliquary after the image) to, say, 200C, producing some visible chromophores (yellow -I have still not been able to produce fluorescence without any visible change at all), and some invisible fluorochromes. (Your Phase 1 above) I believe the fluorochromes form at one temperature, and are indeed degraded into non-fluorescence after a very small increase in temperature. If I pour a blob of molten lead onto a piece of linen, and (after tipping it off) look at it under UV light, the scorch itself does not glow, it just looks brown, but it is surrounded by a coastline of yellow-green fluorescence, as if a steep temperature gradient is being illustrated, from no change, to fluorochrome, to visible scorch (shades of brown) and eventually to char (black). Your Phase 2 then, is the application of a hot template, which would turn more of the fluorochromes into non-fluorescing scorch, reduducing the overall fluorescence.I entered the shroudstory/shroudwithoutallthehype fray trying to demonstrate (with you) that the image could be a scorch, but was consistently obstructed by the “scorches fluoresce but the image does not fluoresce” chant. I think the idea that scorches only in fact fluoresce round the edges, and that the fluorescence of the shroud image is smothered by the overall backgroud fluorescence, overcomes this obstruction.","date":"December 16, 2012 at 10:14 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/lets-poke-em-with-hokum/","cat":"hokum","title":"“Let’s poke ’em with hokum…”"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks for your comment Thibault.

I wonder if de Wesselow would consider the image ‘culturally, stylistically and technically’ impossible from a 16th (as opposed to a 14th) century viewpoint. I thought of this while reading David Hockney’s book ‘Secret Knowledge’ last night, where he thinks that portrait painters from about 1430 used a camera lucida (basically some lenses and prisms) to project images onto their paper so that they could be drawn up very accurately. He illustrates his book with dozens of examples, and points out parts of big paintings where the perspectives and sizes don’t quite match up correctly, due, he thinks, to the painter having to move the camera lucida around as it could only cover a bit at a time.

When turned up full, a bit of lead sitting on it melts quite easily, but a similar bit of zinc doesn’t melt at all, so its temperature is presumably in the mid to high 300s C. I also have a small steel peppermint box (courtesy of Starbucks), about 5cm x 4cm x 1cm high, Into which I put a folded up bit of linen about 9cm x 6cm, closed the lid and put it (cold) onto the hotplate (hot). I then put a bit of lead on the top of the box just to see if it would reach melting temperature. (I do have some glass thermometers that go up to 300C, but I’m not sure how accurate they are; they’re immersion thermometers and not good at hotplates, reading a maximum of about 240C even when lying on the plate).Anyway, after ten minutes, I took the box off (the lead on the top hadn’t melted at all) and prized open the lid. Most of the linen was charred black, and what wasn’t was well scorched – much browner than old newspaper, for example. The char, of course, didn’t fluoresce at all, and the scorched bit quite weakly (as advertised).Now silver melts at about 900C, depending on its quality, and I seriously wonder how a linen cloth could receive serious melt damage from a silver reliquary without being previously scorched quite badly all over, and probably charred to destruction in several places. I’ll bet a pound to a penny no shroudie has popped and old sheet into a metal tank, heated it in a bonfire until bored and then had a look inside, but I think the results would have been quite disturbing…Or am I wrong?I’m a bit reluctant (well, totally reluctant actually) to look through a microscope at a sample lit by UV, as I don’t know how much will be reflected up the barrel, but I have a feeling that there is a very small temperature difference between degradation to fluorescence, and degradation to visible scorching, at which point fluorescence stops. Certainly areas of fluorescence look much bigger than the visible scorches they surround, but I’ve never been able to get fluorescence completely unaccompanied by visible browning. However, I suspect that as it is heated, something (cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, other starches, sugars or carbohydrates generally?) first degrades into a chemical that fluoresces but is visibly unchanged, and then degrades further into something that is visibly yellow or brown, but does not fluoresce. The weak fluorescence of a lightly scorched cloth is due to the browned fibres not fluorescing at all, and only unbrowned fibres fluorescing. Obviously, any further scorching, such as somebody playing with hot bas reliefs, would increase the area of visible scorching, and therefore decrease the area of fluorescence.Which is why it is said that the image does not fluoresce.Does that make sense?","date":"December 9, 2012 at 11:50 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/lets-poke-em-with-hokum/","cat":"hokum","title":"“Let’s poke ’em with hokum…”"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks Adrie.The background fluorescence continues to intrigue me. Is age itself (oxidation presumably) enough to make linen fluoresce? Or was it treated with something naturally fluorescent in manufacture? Or was it heated? I don’t know, but if I want to make non-fluorescent linen fluoresce in ten minutes, 220C is a good temperature, while Miller and Pellicori found that 125C-150C (perhaps for an hour or so?) would also do the job.I’m sure you’re correct that the picture of the hands has either been exposed for a long time, or pushed in processing, to show the fluorescence. However it does show an image area (the front of the thighs) either fluorescing itself, or at least not suppressing any background fluorescence. I’d love to see other areas of the shroud (recognised scorches) for example, photographed in a similar way. It may be that Miller and Pellicori addressed this, but I can’t get hold their paper. Yet.Guerreschi and Salcito clearly showed, I think, that the burn holes were made by something solid, not liquid, but they were less convincing about how the solid arrived on the cloth. They wonder if the casket was in fact made of wood, with silver or gold panels, and the wood burnt through, or that the fire was hot enough for ‘weld points’ to yield, or that something might have sat on top of the casket heavy enough to buckle it. All of this, I submit, would have charred the insides irredeemably. Another relevant point, which I have only just noticed in their papers, is the tiny amount of water apparently used to extinguish the smoulder, judging by the size of the water marks which they attribute to that incident. This is not, I think, indicative of someone desperately trying to cool a casket, but of a well targeted application just to cool the burns themselves.I think I’ll have to give up on the pink…I found alas that my coloured cotton shirts were all mixed with artificial fibres which just melted under heat!

Rather than impugn his integrity, we might be better off exploring why Zugibe thought so differently.For a start, they were both working from a picture of an indistinct bloodstain. I am rather taken with Mathias’s idea that the wound is too close to the knuckles to be a ‘wrist’ wound, but that’s assuming the big oval blob closest to the fingers is, in fact, the site of the nail-hole. It looks as if Zugibe took it to be one end of the thinner of the two arms of the famous bifurcation (the end nearest the thumb), while Barbet took it to be the middle of the thicker one.However, I’m not sure it really matters. It is apparent from the various dissections available on the internet – (not for the squeamish, but have a look at: http://nervesurgery.wustl.edu/NerveImages/Anatomy%20and%20Physiology/AP-Median-Nerve—IMG_3299.jpg, or http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LUBKf8T5CfA/Tid4go2Yv7I/AAAAAAAABTo/XNwHvBtXKcM/s1600/human_body_dissection_05.jpg, or http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Branches_of_median_nerve.jpg) – that wrist nerves, bloodvessels and tendons are rather squashed in just anyhow, and there are substantial variations from the standard model. A tap on a nail in the middle of the wrist is equally likely to send it sliding down either side of the capitate bone, whence it could equally well go through Destot’s, Zugibe’s or even Bevilaqua’s space. Any or all of the nerves of the wrist are quite likely to be damaged.Talking of which, there are several websites which refer to damage to the median nerve. In none of them is there any reference to the thumb being flexed tight across the palm, although there is some inward flexion towards the little finger. In spite of several model crucifixes with just such a contraction, does Barbet in fact claim it to that extent? There is a picture of one of Barbet’s crucified corpses in Zugibe’s response to him (http://www.crucifixion-shroud.com/Barbet.htm) and while it does appear to have nerve damage (the 4th and 5th fingers are curled inwards) the thumbs are not conspicuously flexed.","date":"December 13, 2013 at 8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/was-zugibe-deliberately-and-dishonestly-trying-to-mislead-his-readers/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Was Zugibe deliberately and dishonestly trying to mislead his readers?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I don’t how accurately the Christian Post is reporting Habermas’s lecture, but one or two statements strike me as peculiar.“One of the discoveries based on enhanced images of the Shroud presented is that the person’s teeth were showing through the skin – possible signs of the resurrection for those who believe that the man is indeed Jesus Christ.

Really? These were highly speculative spectrographic tests that made an interesting contribution to non-destructive radiocarbon analysis. To say they “established” anything at all is grossly overestimating them.“Furthermore, traces of dirt on the man’s feet, which have been subjected to chemical analysis published in a peer-reviewed secular chemistry journal, were noted to be from a species of limestone that is found almost exclusively in Jerusalem.” Aragonite is the second commonest form of limestone on the planet and although there is indeed aragonite limestone in Jerusalem, detailed isotopic tests would be needed to identify a specimen of limestone found on the shroud as from that particular area.

For those who haven’t found it, here is the abstract.The 18O/16O ratios of cellulose and the D/H ratios of cellulose nitrate were determined for linen, a textile produced from the fibers of the flax plant Linum usitatissimum, and for maize (Zea mays) from a variety of geographic locations in Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America. The regression lines of δD values on δ18O values had slopes of 5.4 and 5.8 for the two species. Statistical analysis of results reported in the only other study in which samples of a single species (the silver fir Abies pindrow) that grew under a variety of climatic conditions were analyzed yielded slopes of ~6 when δD values of cellulose nitrate were regressed on δ18O values of cellulose. The occurrence of this previously unrecognized relationship in three species suggests it may obtain in other plants as well. Determining the basis for this relationship, which is not possible given current understanding of fractionation of the isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen by plants, should lead to increased understanding of how D/H and 18O/16O ratios in cellulose isolated from fossil plants are related to paleoclimates. The separation of most linen samples from Europe from those originating in the Middle East when δD values are plotted against δ18O values suggests it may be possible to use the isotope ratios of cellulose prepared from the Shroud of Turin to resolve the controversy concerning its geographic origin.","date":"April 3, 2013 at 12:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/01/alan-boyles-cosmic-log-on-fantis-new-book/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Boyles Cosmic Log on Fanti’s New Book"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The translation above contains some delightful but somewhat misleading idiosyncracies (Translating Prof. Fanti as “infantryman” or “footsoldier” for example; and translating “sottoscrito” as “yours truly”), so I hope a clearer, if slightly freer translation of Fanti’s riposte to his critics may be helpful:“1.

His declaration has been quickly followed by some nervous backtracking by the Archbishop of Turin, Cesare Nosiglia, to the effect that even if the taking of the samples was authorised, the length of time since 1978 has rendered their provenance insecure.

The original date of the FTIR analysis (p.90 of Il Mistero della Sindone) was 752 BC +/- 400 yrs. This was adjusted by adding about 450 years to arrive at 300 BC +/- 400 yrs, according to some experiments carried out by heating moden cloth. The original date of the Raman Spectroscopy analysis was 200 BC +/- 400 yrs. However, it was not felt necessary to correct this date: neither Fanti nor Rinalsi comment on it further. The third set of results, the mechanical deformation set, gave a range of five dates from about 750 BC to 900 AD, which were averaged to 400 AD +/- 400 yrs. Rinaldi thought that the 1532 fire was likely to have affected the mechanical strength of the cloth to an extent that this result should be adjusted accordingly, but Fanti said that experiments had shown that the effect of the fire was negligible in this case and also that “the effect of the fire was further reduced by the particular position from which [the fibres he studied] were collected.” I find both those statements strange indeed, considering he was using fibres hoovered up from between the shroud and the backing cloth.","date":"December 8, 2013 at 9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/revisiting-fantis-dating-methods/","cat":"science","title":"Revisiting Giulio Fanti’s Dating Methods"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Sorry, Gian Marco, I see I typoed Rinalsi, and Paulette, above, Ronaldi!

He subjected 12 samples of known age from 3000BC to the present, and observed a noticeable progressive change in the spectra recorded. Flax, it appears can be shown to degrade with age. In ideal situations (permanent storage in a single place of constant environmental conditions) his findings suggest an ascertainable age band of 400 years, which might be narrowed if further ressearch was carried out. Although this method is unlikely ever to be better than C14 dating, it has the merit of being wholly non-destructive.

If somebody says “that looks like a spear-hole,” then (apart from the fact that to me it looks more like a cigar) I can see why he thinks so. I then ask, would there be more to the image of a wound than just its shape. If so, and there is no sign of it on the shroud, then it’s not a spear hole, whatever it looks like, but if a real wound-mark would have the same composition as all the other smears around it, then we have not disproved that it is a wound on those grounds alone.

I’m finding it difficult to read your blog in detail from start to finish as I keep getting distracted and having to look things up elsewhere!The marking on the shroud referred to above has an upper-left edge which is different from the other edges, if so they may be termed. The upper-left edge has a distinct slightly elliptical curve, each end of which terminates in an abrupt, almost right angular corner. The edge is quite distinct (although it has a lighter-coloured fringe), and the area below it is darker than the rest of the alleged stain, in an approximate cigar-shape which some have likened to the cross-section of a spear. The left hand edge is also very distinct, but does not have a regular shape, and the rest of the stain has patches of light and dark which could be interpreted as twisted-rivulet shaped, even if they aren’t actually anything of the kind.I’m not sure about your identification though. If I’m right, you are not denying the existence of the distinct (possibly spear-shaped) section, but you are saying that it is not qualitatively different from the rest of the stain. What I’m wondering is what sort of difference might be expected if it WAS a wound. Would laying a sheet over a stabbed body be able to differentiate between the source of some gore and the oozings derived from it?

I have several questions revolving in my mind, and you might be able to clarify one or two.I have not read, I think, that the previous researchers thought that the ‘background fluorescence’ might itself be due to a scorch – they tend to attribute it to part of the manufacturing process, in spite of Miller’s experiment showing that “Modern linen can be artificially aged by baking at high temperature (125º-150º C) to the point where its reflected color and fluorescent emission approach those of the Shroud.” I find that 10 minutes at 220C will do the same. Yet the shroud has been heated at least once, and possibly more, to at least that temperature. Even if there were another reason for the fluorescence, that heating would be sufficient.It’s not obvious to me what is meant by ‘weakly fluorescent.’ Looking at the picture of the hands, which Colin posted above, there appears to be a bright oval of yellow-green fluorescence centred roughly in the middle of the picture, with darker margins at the edges (particularly the upper edge) as if a bright spotlight were being aimed at that particular place. If this was a UV light, and if the photo shows the reflected visible light, then I don’t call that ‘weak,’ but remarkably bright. What’s more it is all around the image of the hands. if (just suppose, for the sake of argument) a hot bas relief of a pair of hands had been pushed onto a piece of modern linen, that is exactly the picture I would expect, with discolouration (but no fluorescence) where contact or radiation heated the linen to 200C or so, and fluorescence (and very weak colouration) where distance (or perhaps a cooler bit of the bas relief) heated the surrounding region to, say 190C.I have recently been heating bits of linen in an oven, and find that at 250C, ten minutes is enough to char it a uniform mid-brown. I now find it staggeringly unlikely that the shroud could have sat in a silver ‘oven’ (its casket) at a temperature of 900C (to melt the silver), without being totally destroyed.Finnally, in a last attempt to produce pink fluorescence, I placed a piece of linen in a glass tube and passed methane (my ordinary lab gas) through the tube, then, after a few seconds so that there could not be any oxygen left in the tube, and with the methane still flowing, inserted a red hot steel spatula into the open end (yes, very nervously) onto the linen, and scorched it. Removing the spatula, waiting for the linen to cool, turning off the methane, and examining the linen under UV produced… yup, the same old yellow-green as ever!Not really questions then, but I’d be grateful for your thoughts!","date":"December 17, 2012 at 4:56 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/lets-poke-em-with-hokum/","cat":"hokum","title":"“Let’s poke ’em with hokum…”"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Gosh.

It just made me want to question everything, and try to notice something of my own that nobody else has spotted!Latest news – I soaked a piece of linen in soapy starch and hung it to dry on a bush, then dropped it over a bas relief over which I’d poured a weak ammonia solution, roughly a la Rogers. For a start the contact places just absorbed the liquid into big round splodges (I think Roger’s only used vapour), and for a second there was absolutely no change in colour when the cloth dried out.

The fibre has been broken into those plank-like fragments of microfibril illustrated in my own photo above, some of which have broken completely away, to leave that gap. The reason the gap is not coloured is not, of course, anything to do with the lumen. It’s an empty space, and empty spaces can’t be coloured. No, the reason the gap is not coloured is because either the microfibrils underneath it are uncoloured (and I find with light scorches that there is no need for them to be), or there are no microfibrils there; after all, this fibre was presumably torn off the shroud, and the tape need not have removed the fibre in its entirety. We are told how easily these tapes came away; this was because the image fibres were sufficiently degraded to break away rather than having to be pulled out like the non-image fibres.The picture of the fibre degraded by coronal discharge was formed, we are told, by ironing the cloth. That’s what I call a scorch. I can understand that it may be that a CD predisposes cloth to scorch at a lower temperature than usual, as may coatings of sugar or starch, but to my mind, brown marks made by ironing = scorches.As for the ghosts – Is that rather grey, rather grainy photo of two smooth trenches in the sellotape glue the only photo we have of them?

However (and I’m aware I’m going out on a limb here: my knowledge of the microstructure of linen is entirely superficial…) I’m not sure Fanti et al have interpreted their pictures in exactly the same way as I do, although the effect is perhaps the same.My understanding, based on the agrofibrecomposites site which I have mentioned above, is that the structure of a fibre is more complex than a simple ‘PCW – SCW – Lumen’ model, in that the “inner cellulosic material” of the SCW is not amorphous, but itself divided into ‘microfibrils,’ which are the things which have broken up into the rectangular sections we see on Fanti’s photo. I don’t know if each of the microfibrils has a PCW of its own (but presumably they have some kind of structure), and I don’t know if the whole fibre is sheathed in its own cell wall of some kind. It seems to break up quite readily when heated.So where Fanti sees a single thin PCW layer coating a thick amorphous SCW with a hole in it, I see a bundle of a dozen or fewer microbrils. Where his PCW is torn away like peeling paint to reveal uncoloured SCW, I see fragments of microfibrils broken away to reveal other microfibrils, which are uncoloured. I don’t think the overall effect of the image, or the mechanism of its appearance, would be very different in either case.Having said that, one of Fanti’s threads (Photo 9 and particularly 10 in your link) looks so exactly like a torn PCW sheath around an amorphous core that I am given pause, as they say! I will have to start stressing some more fibres to see if I can achieve the same result, coloured or uncoloured.","date":"January 15, 2013 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/time-maybe-for-a-radical-re-jigging-of-the-scorch-model-and-of-the-alleged-superficiality-of-the-shroud-image-too/","cat":"hugh_farey","title":"Time maybe for a radical re-jigging of the scorch model – and of the alleged superficiality of the Shroud image too?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think the difference between pareidolia and a true representation is that a representation is intended to resemble, or has been made by, the reality it depicts. A painting of the Mona Lisa looks like the Mona Lisa, and a shadow on a wall looks like the tree that caused it. The man on the shroud either left a representation of himself – consciously or unconsciously – or was depicted by an artist who wanted to create an image of that man. On the other hand a cloud which looks like an elephant is a pareidolia, and the shadow of a tree that looks like an octopus is another. If the teeth on the Shroud were caused in some way by actual teeth, then they are not pareidolia, but accurate observation. If they are mere artefacts of the imperfections on the cloth, then they are pareidolia. The image of the man is not pareidolia unless it is a random collection of discolourations which coincidentally resemble a man. The fact that an image is made of halftone dots, paint or photographic emulsion does not make it pareidolia, in my opinion.","date":"October 26, 2015 at 3:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"The only actual test I can find being proposed anywhere is “multispectral imaging,” which is what was carried out in 1978.

The crease above the disputed one is clearly identifiable in both photos, as is the one across the top of the head. What’s more, these creases are quite clearly more pronounced in the Pia photo than on the Enrie. The reason for this is evident both by looking at the Pia photo closely, and also by noticing the the Pia photo is slightly wider with respect to its length than the Enrie. It is because Pia’s Shroud is visibly quite badly wrinkled all over, while Enrie’s has been brushed, pulled or stretched slightly to remove all those minor wrinkles. In spite of that, a new crease is boldly evident in 1931 that is not evident in 1898.","date":"October 23, 2015 at 1:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/22/available-critical-summary-version-3-0/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Available: Critical Summary Version 3.0"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"It’s a shame that this blog is not read more carefully.

The trouble with the fall-through hypothesis is that, being imaginary, its parameters can be adjusted so that it fits whatever observations we want. If a critic were to say that the instantaneous disappearance of 70kg of mass would create a sudden large vacuum which would suck the shroud into a screwed up ball in the middle, then we simply have to invent a physics in which that doesn’t happen. If he says that the energy emitted by such a disappearance would exceed that produced by several megatons of nuclear bomb, vaporising the Shroud and most of Jerusalem with it, we simply invent a physics in which that doesn’t happen either. All we need is for a “body wrapped in the Shroud to become volumetrically radiant […] and simultaneously mechanically transparent, thus offering time-decreasing resistance to the cloth as it collapsed through the body space.” Simples.

If everything was as obvious as John makes out, then the problem would be resolved and the C14 date discredited by all and sundry, but unfortunately it isn’t. It is easy to calculate the amount of carbon which needs to be added to a 1st century textile in order to skew the date towards the 14th century, and none of Rogers’ discoveries come close. The easiest way would be to sprinkle soot on the cloth. As cloth is only about 40% carbon, and soot is 100% carbon, only a small amount would be required. I forget the exact proportion, perhaps about 15%, which unfortunately would be turn the cloth black. Adding a transparent or similarly coloured compound would be best, but, as the proportion of carbon in such a compound is so much less, a correspondingly greater amount would be necessary. As has often been shown, at least 60% of the fabric would have to be modern in order to produce the required skew. This has not been demonstrated by Rogers or anyone else. Jackson is correct on that point.With John’s latter five paragraphs, I am entirely in accord.","date":"October 14, 2014 at 7:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/14/dj-vu-squared/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Déjà vu Squared"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Because the whole thing was nothng more than a theatrical prop, perhaps? I too, find the whole creases thing less than convincing. I have never seen any good “raking light” photos that demonstrate these creases, although they are frequently mentioned in this connection, and am certainly not aware that creases in fact have any particular longevity. The only creases that we can be certain of (because of the 1532 fire) were almost indistinguishable even before the 2002 restoration, and the creases from when the shroud received its big diamond pattern water stains have completely disappeared. Creases no doubt came and went whenever the shroud was rolled and unrolled, and being roughly transverse, any selection could be selected to fit in with some kind of lifting gear. It seems that the elaborate design put forward by Jackson was mostly to account for a mass of closely spaced creases he observed around the ventral groin area, but lifting a cloth out of a box doesn’t require anything half so elaborate, even if it was by a hidden mechanism so that the operators were invisible.","date":"October 20, 2014 at 5:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/20/in-the-belly-of-the-beast/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"In the Belly of the Beast"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“Why should the Shroud have uniquely survived?” This is a fair question; one which I asked a few posts ago and one which Charles gave some possible answers to. The Shroud was indeed a “primus inter pares.” He suggested that if any of a multitude of similar ritual objects had become associated with a specific miracle, then that would accord it the very special status John was looking for. My own ideas, that it had moved from an area where Quem Quaeritis rituals were common to a place where they were unknown, or that it resurfaced years after the rituals had ceased to be practiced, do not seem to me unreasonable either.Nevertheless, although Charles has placed the Shroud quite neatly within a ritual and even artistic context (the rise of ‘whole-body’ flagellation imagery being an example), he is as aware as anybody – perhaps more so as I’ve no doubt he has looked more assiduously – that there are no comparable double-imaged, paint-flaked-off cloths to push his argument beyond dispute. There is no point in attempting to refute his argument by demanding one. All you can do – and it’s a perfectly valid point – is to say that the lack of contemporary material convinces you that he is wrong.John also has a perfect right to demand references for things like “inventories listing shrouds.” However it seems that History today, although it demands references from its authors, has the custom of not printing them. Perhaps it enjoys stimulating controversy, or perhaps it thinks that, as some articles would have longer lists of references than the articles themselves, the content of each edition would be too restricted to be of general interest. Perhaps, after the article has arrived at the kiosks, Charles will post a link to his sources.","date":"October 21, 2014 at 9:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/20/in-the-belly-of-the-beast/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"In the Belly of the Beast"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"That’s very generous of you, Antero.

Not: “These experiments revealed that there was no image beneath the blood or beneath the blood serum at the boundary of the tested bloodstains. The image colour was found to terminate consistently at the boundary of the bloodstains.” It was Heller and Adler’s conclusion that the process of creating the image corroded the fibres of the Shroud, and that therefore that process had not occurred in the region of the bloodstains. Later Rogers disagreed with them, and in this respect agreed with McCrone, that the image was formed on something covering the fibres, and that there was no corrosion of the fibres themselves.It is my contention that any fibres from a bloodstained area could all be considered ‘blood’ fibres, as the blood soaked all over and through the cloth, whereas, even if there were image beneath the bloodstains, only a tiny proportion could be considered ‘image’ fibres as the image formed only on the very outer fibres of the crowns of the warp threads. The chances of a randomly selected fibre from such an area being an ‘image’ fibre at all are thus very slight, even if there is actually image under the blood. Furthermore, the blood has largely eroded from the top surface of the shroud, from exactly the place where the image and the blood could have coincided, and ‘blood’ fibres are more typically found in the weft ‘valleys’ where there is no image anyway.The UV images show a pronounced halo of ‘serum’ around the tip of a fingerlike bloodstain emerging from the wrist wound, and another along the top edge of the spear wound. (There are others, of course). However, there in no change in colour or intensity between the ‘serum’ areas and the adjacent ‘image’ areas when viewed in visible light. If there is no image beneath the serum then the colour of the serum exactly matches the colour of the image – an extraordinary coincidence that I don’t believe. See below.The Critical Summary goes on to claim that “These findings support three (3) important conclusions.”The first is that the blood must have arrived before the image. I don’t agree that it must have been, for the reasons outlined above.The second is that there is no evidence of artistic materials on top of the bloodstains. This conclusion is not based on the evidence above (about corroded fibres), and is not true, as both red ochre and vermillion were found, both by Heller and Adler and McCrone. This is evidence. It may be discounted or explained away, but to claim that there is no evidence is simply wrong.The third conclusion is that there is no ‘major damage’ to the bloodstains. This also is nothing to do with the corrosion evidence cited above, and is also highly disputable. What on earth constitutes ‘damage’ to a bloodstain? I think the authors mean that the bloodstains are not smeared, which shows only that they were dry before anything in contact with them was moved. They do show a fair amount of abrasion and flaking off, which to my mind is just about the only ‘damage’ a bloodstain can sustain. There is some suggestion that an artistic rendering of the image is ruled out by the lack of ‘damage’ to the ‘blood’ (…”resulting from an artistic effort to create the colored image fibres.”), a comment which makes no sense to me.","date":"October 27, 2015 at 5:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/27/its-the-curmudgeon-in-me/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"It’s the Curmudgeon in Me"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I do not know how precisely the areas used for the X-ray fluorescence coincide with the areas used for the light intensity, and do not think that the two graphs are necessarily mathematically comparable.

As to the uniformity of the iron except in the bloodstains and watermarks, they say later: “We found the calcium to be uniformly distributed over the tape sampled Shroud areas, while the iron, though also ubiquitous, was enhanced in the blood image areas and concentrated in the margins of the water stains.

The opening words of Chapter 13 of John Heller’s book “Report on the Shroud of Turin” are “We had now found iron oxide and mercury sulphide. Both are pigments used by artists. Both are red.” For you to claim: “this is simply not true” is a harsh criticism of John Heller. It is true, and it is evidence. (and the last sentence of the precious chapter refers to a crystal of cinnabar as vermilion)What you failed to quote from my comment was: “It may be discounted or explained away, but to claim that there is no evidence is simply wrong.” And indeed, both you and Heller devote some time to discounting the evidence, which is fair enough. However, there are discrepancies in the discounting, the resolutions of which which are matters of opinion.Heller decided that he couldn’t find any more cinnabar, while McCrone decided that he could find quite a lot. Without going back to the tapes ourselves, we cannot determine the truth of either of their conclusions. Heller (and Adler) found three forms of iron oxide, one of which “the chelated form” was found throughout the Shroud and supposed to be part of the retting process; another, the “heme bound form” is attributed to decayed blood, and the last,  Fe2O3 (red ochre), was found “primarily in the water stain margins and charred blood areas indicating that it only constitutes a very small percentage of the total iron forms found on the Shroud.” McCrone disputes this, and finds particulate iron oxide on all image fibres, but not on background fibres. However, in his “X-Ray Fluorescence Investigation of the Shroud of Turin”, R.A.Morris found a direct correlation between image intensity and iron concentration, from 16.8ug/cm2 on the nose to 9.6ug/cm2 in the imageless space between the cheek and the hair. This is in direct contradiction to Heller’s conclusions, and agrees with McCrone.You may, of course, be correct, and even if you’re not, you are entitled to put your point of view, but a point of view is not evidence. Nor proof. To claim that McCrone’s conclusions were proven wrong (or even PROVEN WRONG) is not true. The particles of red ochre and vermilion may have derived from paintings placed on the Shroud, but this is not proven either. The fact that you, and many others, are convinced that the Shroud is not a painting does not of itself discount the evidence suggesting that that it is, and it certainly doesn’t mean that the evidence doesn’t exist.","date":"October 28, 2015 at 3:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/27/its-the-curmudgeon-in-me/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"It’s the Curmudgeon in Me"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Quite right, Antero, my mistake; I should have written ‘iron’ instead of ‘iron oxide’.

The trend among those who contemplate a 13th century possibility (even if they actually believe the Shroud to be authentic) seems to be towards a chemical scorch, possibly by the application of a hot object, although that hypothesis seems to be weaking, or by heat generated from a chemical reaction, currently being discussed, or by a long-term interaction between cloth and some applied substance (paint/glue or similar) which has since been removed.The dead body proponents, such as yourself, not only have to produce a chemical explanation, such as the post-mortem gas or lactic acid emission and its reaction with something on the surface of the cloth, but also to explain how this gas moved exclusively in a vertical direction, and did not spread out having reached the cloth. This has never been satisfactorily addressed, even by Roger’s. whose attempt was, even by his own admission, somewhat speculative. Furthermore, the dead body proponents have to explain the contact/distance dichotomy, the pose of the dead man and the configuration of the Shroud over him.

Some thorough investigation later. I’m sorry to rain on everybody’s parade, but Mike’s “valley-fold” creases date from 2002 and no earlier. They were not easy to observe before 2002 as they weren’t there at all. They are regularly spaced and do not meet in the middle, extending only as far as the longitudinal scorch lines about a quarter of the width in from the edges. They do not coincide with John Jackson’s supposed lines as sketched in his paper. What they do coincide with, all of them, exactly, without exception, are Mechtilde Flury-Lemberg’s new stitching of the new backing cloth to the shroud, whose threads are clearly visible on Shroud 2.0. Looking carefully at the BBC video at high magnification, you can even see zig-zag marks across these ‘folds’, showing a certain amount of ‘slumping’ as the Shroud was held in a vertical plane. There are ten such lines of stitching, irregularly spaced along the length of the cloth, and none of them crossing the cloth within the scorch-lines. They are nothing to do with any ancient lifting machanism.That does not, of course, mean that I have discredited Jackson’s fold hypothesis entirely. He relied on different supposed creases, in different places. However, his creases still seem to me to be partial-width, curved, and most probably due to rolling up the Shroud, stitched to its backing, around a pole (where, obviously, the inside cloth would have to wrinkle, having a smaller radius of curvature).","date":"October 22, 2014 at 12:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/20/quick-reaction-to-in-the-belly-of-the-beast/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Quick Reaction to In the Belly of the Beast"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Leaving no stone unturned…Jackson’s elaborate jack-in-the-box hypothesis is thoroughly described, and depicted, in the ‘In the Belly of the Beast” post previous to this one.

Now we can attempt to identify whether the creases he observes in the shroud actually are as described, both by using his own (Vern Miller’s) photos, and where available (as coverage is not complete) those on the video heretofore referenced. Sadly, Miller’s photos are not clear enough to be helpful. All the folds look like mountain-folds to me, but I would not swear to more than a few of them. However, we can use these as a reference for the video. In that, A-M, B-M and C-V are visible, and then there is no film until a still at F, where all the folds are all clearly mountain-folds (F1-M, F2-M, F3-M, F4-M) when three of them should be valley-folds.Mike’s still above, incidentally, shows fold B, almost exactly half way between his boldly labelled ‘Fold marks.’ Given all this, and the fact that the creases are all short and mostly curved, I am satisfied that Jackson’s lifting-mechanism hypothesis is not confirmed by observation.","date":"October 22, 2014 at 1:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/20/quick-reaction-to-in-the-belly-of-the-beast/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Quick Reaction to In the Belly of the Beast"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Mike’s referenced BBC video depiction of the creases was certainly done in raking light, but I do not see that they are “sharp and run through the whole length of the cloth.” I presume he mean width, actually, and this leads me to another idea.

Both Rageh Omaar and John Jackson suggest that linen has some sort of memory for creases thanks to permanent deformation of the linen fibres.

The fact is that the results of all these people (except perhaps Barrie, who has been more of a collector of results than an initiator) have not been ignored by people such as Colin and myself, they have been ignored by all those who have only read their conclusions, rejoiced that they supported authenticity, and then used them as impregnable ‘boxes of authority’ that one would have to be insane or criminal to dispute. Throughout this blog and elsewhere, one or two of us have genuinely studied the results, rather than the conclusions, of the people mentioned, and been unable draw the same conclusions.For example. Rogers found a thread which he thought was spliced, old linen and new cotton. Villarreal found that both sides were cotton. Estimates of the amount of cotton in the radiocarbon samples ranges from 2% to 100%.  Benford and Marino speculated (and quoted confirmation for) a line down the middle of a herring-bone “V,” one side of which was old and one side of which was new. They did not realise that for such a scenario, the radiocarbon dates of the samples would include some that were “pure” patch, which is, of course, not the case. These observations are not conclusions. They are results, and they do not point to a coherent explanation for the shroud.Is there one among you (apart from Thibault, who knows this area well) who can explain why the image on the shroud cannot be a scorch? Is there one among you who has actually read Miller & Pellicori’s paper on Ultraviolet Fluorescence? Or the Gilberts, or Accetta & Baumgart, on Reflectance Spectra? What do you make of this observation: “Shroud blood comparisons with known bloodstains show marked differences”? It was made by a “true expert,” or possibly a “Research Scientist” and “independently confirmed” by other “real scientists.”Now let’s look at some real results, shall we, from some real experts…Robert Villarreal and his team at Los Alamos studied some Raes threads by various instruments, but I cannot find that his results are published anywhere. http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf discusses them, but does not give any results. Fortunately, Dan has put a lecture by Villarreal up on Youtube, and there we can see what he actually discovered.On a slide labelled “Analytical Results in Order of Analysis” we have:1) X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy2) Microphotography3) ToF SIMS4) FTIR5) Assessment of Results6) Re-analysis by FTIR7) Micro-spot Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (MXRF) SpectrometryThe first test examined the two ends of a single thread (R1) and found the relative proportions of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Silicon and Calcium present. There was a big difference in the proportion of Carbon (Fuzzy end: 70%, Twisted end 80%) and Oxygen (Fuzzy end: 24%, Twisted end 16%), and a small one in the Silicon (Fuzzy end: 3%, Twisted end 2%).Next, the ToF SIMS instrument sucked the thread apart into three, two pieces of thread and a linking ‘crust.’ At this point in his lecture Villarreral explains that microphotography was useful for looking at individual fibres, but not at groups of fibres as they are cylindrical, and focussing, which is restricted to a single plane, is difficult. The photo of a single fibre from the fuzzy end that he shows looks like a flax fibre, being not twisted, and showing ‘nodes.’ Note that flax fibres are more or less cylindrical while cotton fibres are flat.Now it is not clear next how many fibres or from which ends were individually subjected to ToF SIMS analysis, but Villarreal quotes his expert as follows: “He had a lot of difficulty because when you look at a thread, the thread itself is not conductive, and so it develops space charges; but still, he said, ‘This analysis that we’re looking at looked very much like cotton. I don’t see anything that looks like flax.’ ”Some fibres were then sent off for FTIR analysis, as the spectra of different materials are much easier to recognise this way. Most noticeably, linen has a very distinct carbonyl peak which is completely lacking in cotton. Two fibres from each end were studied and they were all clearly cotton. The crust first gave the cotton spectrum, from embedded contamination, and then, at finer resolution, something that was cautiously identified as a terpene-based resin. Subsequently threads R7 and R14 were also identified as cotton by FTIR analysis, possibly contaminated with the resin of the ‘crust.’Determination of the composition of the threads was by means of reference standards of linen and cotton, but they were modern reference standards, not ancient ones, so an attempt was made to find an ancient thread with which to compare them. In an extraordinary part of the lecture, Villarreal says this: “An individual says, I’ve got a thread, and he gave me a whole history of this thread, and we called it the Tama 4 thread, and he said this is probably one of the main shroud fibres. And we looked at it, and it turns out that we don’t know in fact what this Tama 4 purportedly shroud fibre is. It is not a good match for either the cotton or the linen standard. This may be a result of the ageing effect or the material may be something entirely different.” Some provenance! Nevertheless, it is worth looking at the slide entitled FTIR Absorption Data for Tama 4 “Shroud Fibre.” It’s at 4:43 on ‘Shroud of Turin Ohio State University Villarreal Lecture Part 4 of 5.’ Of the spectrum for Tama 4, Villarreal says: “It’s somewhat comparable with cotton, but it doesn’t have the linen characteristic that we would have liked to have seen.” In other words, assuming for a moment that the thread actually was from the main body of the shroud, and therefore linen, it’s spectrum nevertheless makes it look more like cotton, placing in doubt the identification of the cotton from the Raes threads previously analysed.Villarreal goes onto to display a sticky tape sample given him by Barrie Schwortz, and admits that he is unable to identify the fibres on it. He then shows another whole thread with a thin metal filament around it, about the same diameter as one of the fibres. Having been told this was a gold-iridium wire used by John Brown in his analysis, it turned out to be pure nickel.Sample R1 was then subjected to X-Ray Fluorescence, which identifies whereabouts on a sample various elements can be found. Calcium, Iron, Potassium, Phosphorus, Silicon and Sulphur were identified “all through the thread. Why? We don’t know.” There were minor amounts of all sorts of things, “but we did not see any aluminium.” Oddly, the proportion of Silicon to Calcium by this means was determined as about 1 to 40, whereas by the first test (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), the proportion was about 4 to 1. How odd.Villarreal sums up his findings by saying that the threads he was given were definitely cotton and did not contain flax fibres. This is in marked distinction to the findings of Thibault Heimberger, who also examined R7, and declared that there was only 15% cotton in that same thread. Thibault’s expalnation is that by sheer chance Villarreal’s teams only analysed cotton fibres, among the many flax ones that were in fact present, both in R7, R1 and R14. Finally, Villarreal concluded that the samples he analysed were not representative of the main body of the shroud, even though the only, albeit dubious, thread from the shroud he had gave substantially the same results.The confusions, mis-identifications and uncertainties above are what real science is about. As I said at the start, it is not Colin or myself who “ignore results,” it is those who don’t bother to read or make the effort to understand them who really ignore them, clinging desperately to generalised conclusions in the rather vague hope that that the inconsistencies will disappear if you don’t look at hem.","date":"November 2, 2013 at 12:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/02/consider-rogers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Consider Rogers"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi OK! I think I’ve lost you somewhere. Or maybe you’ve lost me. You appear to be making a plea for people not to try to understand details if they are likely to cast doubt on their convictions. If the shroud is authentic, then no arguments or evidence can make it a forgery, and if the shroud is a forgery, then no arguments or evidence can make it authentic. At present though, all we have to go on is an inconclusive pile of evidence, some for and some against. There are, I know, a number of extremists who, having made up their mind, don’t really need any evidence, and denounce anybody of the opposite camp as an idiot or a criminal, but there’s really no need. Most of us here find the evidence on both sides very finely balanced. It is often confused and uncertain rather than dogmatic, and the difference between those who try to understand it thoroughly, on either side, can be very small. I think Dan has read and understood everything I have, and I wholly respect his “Is the Shroud real? Probably” as I hope he respects my “Unfortunately probably not.”However you do make an important point about the proper criticism of anti-authenticist arguments. There’s a reason for that, which is that there are very few such arguments to criticise. The most powerful one, of course, is the radiocarbon paper. I believe I have examined this as thoroughly as I have any other, and although I find Remi val Haelst’s statistical papers very hard going, I was impressed by Riani and Atkinson’s paper, which I think does demonstrate chronological sequence along the radiocarbon sample. Luckily both these last gentlemen are still alive, and were able to reply to the queries I put to them.The only other scientific paper discrediting the shroud is that of Walter McCrone, as published in Microscope and in his book. His results too I have examined thoroughly, and am largely not in agreement with his conclusions, particularly the importance he gives to vermillion as a pigment, which he didn’t even notice until it was pointed out to him by spectroscopists.Finally, there are the opinions of numerous art historians, who say the shroud is coherent within the artistic conventions of medieval Europe. Well, I think I’ve must have seen very nearly every crucifix, shroud and dead Jesus painted or sculpted between 0 AD and 1700 AD, every naked, or crossed-handed, or flogged, nailed, thorn-crowned or speared body, within the Byzantine or Romanesque traditions of overtall thin people with long thin fingers, in psalters, altar frontals, statues, brass rubbings and images of every kind, and am not persuaded that these art historians are correct. I don’t think the shroud derives from an artistic culture. Mind you, I’m not convinced that an artistic culture derives from the shroud either, so maybe that cuts both ways.Does that help?","date":"November 2, 2013 at 3:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/02/consider-rogers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Consider Rogers"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I don’t believe McCrone was “out to prove the Shroud a fake from the get go.” His letters to Fr Rinaldi (held by the Holy Shroud Guild) suggest exactly the reverse, and a sense of real disappointment when he found he could not agree with the rest of the STURP team.

However they also find a couple of ‘donut-shaped’ areas which ‘appear to be scorches’ although they are ‘brightly fluorescing yellow-green.’ In laboratory tests, they found that “scorches emit a bright greenish-yellow fluorescence if produced in air and reddish if produced under conditions of limited available oxygen.” It is not clear to me if this means that they found that the brown scorches in visible light (darker than the background) were yellow in UV, lighter than the background.

I thought it might be in association with the body image, but it seems to be spread too widely over the cloth. Then I thought it might have been due some anointment, as the M&P images seemed to show it concentrated in the middle of the cloth – however, as I now see that the top, bottom and left edges of every photo are dark (not just the famous corner where the C14 came from) I think the fluorescence may cover the whole cloth after all, and the fringe darkness is an artefact of the photography. So is it a common feature of 1st century middle eastern or 14th century French cloth? Has anybody checked? If not, then the unusual preparation of the cloth may be significant. M&P say that they can replicate the background fluorescence with heat (which they don’t believe happened), but they do not demonstrate that it can be achieved by ‘aging’ (whatever that means). Since the shroud has spent most of its life rolled up, I would expect some sort of banding, darker on the outside and lighter in the middle, if light, heat, oxygen or other gas were responsible for ‘aging’ the shroud over hundreds of years.

However, to conclude that this observation precludes a scorch is, I think incorrect. My scorching experiments on linen invariably result in something very similar – a dark scorch surrounded by “background” fluorescence. On the shroud, this background fluorescence extends well beyond the image, so was probably produced separately, but not necessarily by a different mechanism. Pellicori and Miller suggest that it is due to aging, but admit that exactly the same effect can be achieved using heat. What’s more, their photographs show the background fluorescence decreasing at the edges of their photos, and especially at the corners of the cloth, which may suggest that it is not as uniform as would be expected if the whole cloth had been similarly treated. (It may also suggest that the UV light was spotlighted in the middle and didn’t reach the edges, but they don’t mention that possibility. There is a whole subsection of the literature about what this ‘edge-decrease’ might mean regarding the C14 sample, but it might not really be there at all!)They also observe that the big scorches on the shroud (but not the minor ones) actually fluoresce themselves, and there is a massively enhanced photo (ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p07.pdf) which does show red fluorescence from the darkest parts of the 1532 burn marks. The rest of the discolouration, image, blood or scorch, does not fluoresce, although there is a bright halo around the outer edge of the spear-wound. I still find this red fluorescence very odd, and wonder if it is not simply the reflection of the red visible light shining off the wholly (shiny?) carbonised areas.","date":"January 7, 2013 at 9:03 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres)."},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hugh appreciates anybody who actually tries to replicate the image formation mechanism rather than just talking about it.

Every mention I can find claiming that there is no image under the blood refers to two papers, both by Heller and Adler, in Applied Optics and the Canadian Forensic Society Science Journal. The first, which available online, does not, in fact, mention the image at all, and the second (in a journal whose real name is “The Canadian Society of Forensic Science Journal) is not online. However I found the following quotation on randi.org. “It is interesting to point out that many of these wound images appear to have a border encircling the darkly colored area where body image is absent, a halo of sorts that can clearly be seen as such in the UV photography…”(Heller, J. H.; Adler, A. D. The Canadian Society of Forensic Science Journal 1981, 14, 81 – 103). [Correctly named this once!]. I believe this refers to the UV fluorescent halo which is occasionally mentioned encircling one of the tips of the blood image on the wrist. In ordinary light, (as on the shroudscope photos) no such halo can be seen, and in its place the fabric is as dark as anywhere else on the image. I do not know if this article says anything else about the subject or not.Elesewhere, there is reference to the blood being dissolved away, and no image being revealed underneath. However these chemical experiments were carried out on single threads, where the blood is present in crystallised lumps. Given that the image is mostly present on the tops of threads, and the blood mostly in the furrows, I don’t understand how this claim can be made, unless a clearly yellowed thread equally clearly stopped being yellow under a lump of blood, and then was yellow again when it emerged from the other side. I have not read any evidence to that effect.Back on fluorescence, I note that the entire shroud fluoresces weakly, and wonder how the image, however it was made, manages to suppress this, unless those who claim the image doesn’t fluoresce really mean that it doesn’t fluoresce any more than the rest of the shroud. However the image was made, if the entire shroud was subjected to a temperature of, say, 200°C, it would all be slightly scorched (accounting for its sepia colour?), and its overall fluorescence would mask any fluorescence made when the image was formed. I have only seen one picture of the shroud under UV light (the one with the ‘halo’ round the blood), and it all seems to be glowing quite brightly.

Until January this year all Dan’s references to Stephen’s site were complementary. Even his response to Stephen’s first suggestion that the radiocarbon data might have been hacked was interested and encouraging. “This ‘mini-series’ sounds promising. Stephen isn’t joking and the title of this posting, being as it is a play on the title of Feynman’s most famous book, is meant as a full-throated compliment to Stephen, assuming he pulls it off.”I was less complimentary, as even in this first post there was a serious misunderstanding of Gove’s statistical analysis of the shroud (which it is not clear Stephen really understands even now), and a misrepresentation of Robert Hedges’ viewpoint. Although he was quick to qualify what he meant by fraud, he firmly announced his intention to “set out the evidence for … the bias and dishonesty of those involved in the dating,” which seemed, in the absence of any such evidence, libellous.Stephen second post (Labelled Part 1) was in February. Now the ‘fraud’ had become some kind of computer hacking, but no evidence at all was put forward. Dan was disappointed. So was I. Stephen thanked Dan for the publicity he was being given. Part 2, the following day, added nothing more, and to be fair to the dubious, Dan suggested we look at Wikipedia’s Timeline of Computer Security Hacker History.Part 3 appeared a few days later and “the hacker” was more or less established. However still no evidence had been put forward and I was prepared to dismiss this whole idea as preposterous. Dan didn’t comment at all.By March 7 it was either “a KGB agent hacked into the AMS system control console computer at each of the three C-14 labs and inserted a program” or “anyone with the requisite computer skills, even a university student hacker testing his ability.” When both Professors Jull and Ramsey had replied to my emails saying this was impossible, they were described as “ambiguous,” “misleading” and “defensive,” with “fallacious reasoning and false facts.” However Stephen now turned his attention to the possibility of individual hackers at each of the three labs, and, picking on Arizona University first, fingered two of the radiocarbon team with deep suspicion, while announcing boldly that he couldn’t prove they were guilty.Until this moment, Dan still hadn’t murmured a derogatory word, but at last, under some pressure from his readers, felt that direct personal accusations of fraud without any evidence whatsoever were unacceptable on his blog.Nothing constructive has occurred since, but I cannot find that Dan has been derogatory about Stephen anywhere.

As usual there is more to this than meets the eye. According to the Villadas (A New Look at the Validity of the Carbon-14 Dating of the Shroud – shroud.com), Rogers passed on a single slide with a single speck of indeterminate composition to Kohlbeck, who identified it as aragonite and in turn passed it on to Levi-Setti, who analysed it as best he could. A single speck. I am not aware that anybody else has analysed any other speck.Caesar Barta (at holyshroudguild.org) takes up the story. He notes that Aragonite is widespread and very common, and therefore not a good proof that the shroud is associated with the Jerusalem sample, but he prints the mass spectrometer spectra.These are not easy to read, and are somewhat deceptive, as the spectrum from the shroud overlays, and in many places obscures that of the Jerusalem sample, and the diagrams are blurred. What’s more, as Barta points out, the spectrum from the shroud includes that of underlying linen, as the speck could not be removed from it. Nevertheless, reading from left to right of Diagram 1: Positive Secondary Ions, there are some curious points to observe, which somebody may be able to explain.1) The spectrum begins with a huge Hydrogen spike for the Jerusalem sample (J), and no corresponding one for the Shroud (S) at all.2) Lithium has a small S spike but no J evidence.3) There is 10 times as much sodium in J as there is in S.4) Magnesium and Aluminium spikes appear to be similar, but S has silicon and J does not.5) The next named spike is Potassium, of which there is about the same.6) Then comes Calcium, with a huge J spike, 100 times bigger than the S spike.7) And then Cobalt, of which there is10 times as much in J as in S.8) The next collection is the CaO/Fe group, which again shows a huge discrepancy between the two spikes,9) And finally Gallium (?), of which there is a lot in S but very little in J.I will refrain from repeating my survey for Diagram 2, the Negative Secondary Ions, but I hope I have said enough to make people go back for another look. The two spectra look nothing like each other, and if we are to accept that in fact they show a similarity between the speck on the shroud and a sample of Jerusalem limestone, then could some expert please explain how?","date":"March 23, 2013 at 10:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/23/stephen-jones-adds-another-part-to-his-series/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Stephen Jones adds another part to his series"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"If the Lord has revealed the secrets of the Shroud to mere children I wish we knew which ones…","date":"March 8, 2014 at 7:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/08/stephen-jones-persists-with-the-hacker-theory/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Stephen Jones Persists with the Hacker Theory"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks, Gabriel.

Sure enough, the lemony areas darkened much more quickly than the rest. However, sudden inspiration! So far, we have been placing irregular heat onto regular cloth (hot bas reliefs on linen), whereas what I was doing in the kitchen was placing regular heat on irregular cloth (grill on lemon drops). As my half-term is drawing to a close, I must get back to earning a living, but with your trusty African mask and pencil-shapener, why not mix up a paste involving lemon juice (or milk or some other invisible ink) and something to make it pasty, rub it on your artefacts, dab them, just as you did when then they were hot, successively onto your cloth, and when they’re dry, put the whole thing in the oven. Conductivity…I also noticed that the cloth, lying on the metal bars of the grill, didn’t char at all where it was in contact with the metal bars, which were presumably conducting the heat away so fast (as in your boiling water in a paper bag experiment) that the cloth didn’t get hot enough. So I placed a horse brass on the grill, and put some cloth on top. Brilliant. A lovely negative of the brass, with everything scorched except the shape underneath. I’ve no idea whether this has any implications for the shroud, but it was quite interesting anyway.Finally…Time for a blockbuster, mind-shattering bestseller of an idea, if it hasn’t been thought of before.Given, for the sake of argument, the following:1) the C14 dating is genuine (which lots of people dispute)2) technically the shroud is impossible to fake (which has yet to be determined)3) the shroud is a representation of Jesus (which most people accept)4) the blood marks were added later (which nearly everybody disputes)5) that there was at least one and probably a handful of full length images of Christ knocking around in France in the 14th century (accepted by some, who explain their provenance as being copies of ‘our’ shroud, but if the few images of the Besancon shroud I’ve seen are anything to go by, not so impossible as 14th century creations).My hypothesis is that ‘our’ shroud was in fact the backing sheet of one of the others. They may have been to our eyes obvious fakes, but if whatever they were painted with (the medium rather than the pigment) transferred onto the backing sheet, it may well only have stained the topmost fibres of the backing (my dabbing with ink, or lemon juice idea). In a subsequent hot incident, the painting became sufficiently discoloured, or brittle, to have to be thrown away, leaving a most surprising, and in fact much better replacement.If only I was an author. Trouble is, I don’t know to what extent I accept any of my initial assumptions.

Both kinds are, of course, readily visible under a microscope, as they involve the interpolated threads running alongside their original counterparts for some distance on either side of the missing section. I’ll happily agree that to the naked eye they are practically invisible, but on enlargements such as the Evans micrographs or Barrie Schwortz’s photos of the retained Tucson portion, they would be very visible. Shroud 2.0 makes an interesting study, as it shows the Shroud simply riddled with inconsistencies, which may indeed be due to repair.

The heavy contact can be not too dark, the light contact not too light, and a bit of non-contact still visible. The trouble is that the discolouration seems to cover entire areas of threads, including the hidden surfaces and the back of the cloth.2) The best fibre results come from metal, but with a very brief contact time (a second or less).

From the moment one entered the reception area, some half a mile from the exposition, to the moment one was debouched back into the piazza, there was not one single indication that the Shroud had anything at all to do with any religion, let alone Christianity, let alone that it might be authentic, except for a few panels describing the lives of some saints mostly associated with Turin. The words Jesus, or Christ, any religious context at all, were scrupulously avoided. The explanatory pamphlet and the short film describing the Shroud did not mention anything at all about what we might be going to see – even the trickles of blood from the hair were described as ‘from thorns’ with no mention of a crown. The route to the Cathedral reminded me forcefully of the access corridor to Gate 43 from the Departure Lounge of Brussels airport, which I had recently visited, and so carefully were the visitors shielded from the interior of the Cathedral that it was difficult to be sure that one was actually in one unless one was very observant. The Shroud itself hung in a limbo of blue frame hovering amid deep red curtains, and the only sign of any respect were a pair of armed civilian police. The route out was equally shrouded, followed by another airport corridor, and an exit which made it quite difficult to work out which building we had actually been into. The illumination of the Shroud, which is heavily blue accented to increase image contrast, was so flat that one could not honestly say whether one was looking at a cloth, a photo of a cloth, or even a projection.No, I forget, there was a brief prayer from somebody while we were in its presence, in which I caught the word Jesu, and it may be that the Italian versions of the pamphlet and film were more reverential.Now have a look at some of Charles’ pictures of expositions from the past.

There are two distinct and incompatible traditions of depiction of the image on the Shroud, and any explanation of how it was made must at least attempt to reconcile them. Thibault has very rightly drawn attention to the fact that many of those reproductions of the Shroud classed as ‘extractum ex originale’, dating from the 16th century onwards, show an indistinct, nude shape, with its feet together. This surely implies that from the 16th century the original was not very different from how it appears today, and Charles really ought at least to suggest an explanation for this version. I am not taken with the rapid painting on and off of crowns, loincloths, open legs and so on, which, if every copy is accurate must have occurred several times. On the other hand, almost every depiction of the Shroud being exhibited, also from the 16th century onwards, shows a very well defined shape, clearly visible for a long way, with legs apart and feet splayed. If the image was barely visible, then Charles’s detractors really ought to suggest a reason for this version. The idea that it was drawn clearly both so as to fit in with the technicalities of engraving, and to show people who bought it what they should have seen had they only got close enough does not explain the differences in posture and apparel very well. Did none of these eminent artists actually see the artefact they were representing, and did they all copy something else?Both versions are as likely to have crowns of thorns as not, bloodstains may or may not be present and are almost invariably different from the original, and where illustrations of the burn patches are included at all, they are often reduced to mere symbols, as if the artist had no idea of what they really were. Not until Carlo Cusetti’s image of the late 19th century is it obvious that any of the copyists were attempting an identical representation.Thomas de Wesselow, whose lecture I attended, agrees that painted linen cloths were very common, and that, being mostly ephemeral, there are only about eight extant today. He gives three different methods of painting them, with the suggestion that there may be others. I agree with him that comparing the Shroud to an illustration or portrait or even deliberate faked relic, makes little sense, but he does not explore the idea that it could have been one of the ‘ephemeral’ paraphernalia of liturgical ritual, of which no examples at all remain.Whichever side of the debate one chooses to support, there are serious anomalies in the evidence which need at least to be discussed, not dismissed, or ignored.","date":"June 14, 2015 at 4:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“Would gas diffusion, radiation or light that may have form the shroud image be part of the definition of imprint?” Only metaphorically, I think.

This is a variant on the “if you don’t know how it was done then I must be right” argument, which, as we have seen many times before, works equally well for both sides.Similarly, a statement like this: “I’ve learned one thing – Shroud skeptics will always remain like that, no matter what kind of evidence pointing otherwise will be presented.

I have already discussed some of the evidence which casts doubt on the idea that the Shroud’s image was ever clearly defintiive, in the form of the hopelessly variable inaccuracies of the numerous depictions of it (November 6, 2014 at 4:23 am). However I don’t go along with the idea that the blood is as clear now as it ever was. It is obvious to me that most of it has flaked off, leaving minute fragments jammed into the interstices of the threads. It’s pinkness is another unusual feature that I have not found adequately explained by any natural phenomenon. The ‘red bilirubin’ hypotheses or the idea that blood stays red when applied to saponaria are currently unconvincing, partially because although easy to confirm, no photos of the many experiments claimed to have been carried out seem to have been taken, which I would have thought were a sine qua non.So if blood can flake off, why not paint? Well, I find it odd that not a single flake remains, but then I wonder what we’re looking for? Walter McCrone painted a variety of cloths with iron oxide, which, as I have found out for myself, doesn’t form flakes. Nor, I suppose would other pigments. They are minutely particulate. If they were, by accident or design, inadequately fixed because of inappropriate binder, then, like the blood, they might be reduced to a rather thin covering, mostly jammed between the fibres or threads, rather as McCrone claimed to have discovered. I would need someone experienced in medieval art to help before I speculate much further down that line of exploration. Another reason why all the paint could have fallen off would be that it formed really big flakes (glued together by gesso?) maybe the size of a fingernail. After a fair number of these had fallen off with age, rendering the Shroud distictly patchy but with an unforseen under-image, it would be a simple job to complete the job with a fingernail!So, what do I think?

It’s difficult to tell which of the illustrations are eye-witness copies, and which are copies of copies (in which case the inaccuracies could be accurately preserved) but some of them were presumably made by people who sketched the image in front of them, or from sketches made by people who were looking at it as they sketched.

My answer, as you probably expected, is that I have no idea what the image was like, as the evidence, as so often with the Shroud, is conflicting! Charles is certainly correct to say that contemporary accounts go on and on about how fresh the bloodstains are, in particular, and how clearly the image is depicted, which, if they are to be taken at face value, simply cannot correspond with the image as we see it today. However, as I have suggested above, actual copies of the Shroud, however sharply depicted, are so different that it is difficult to believe that the artists had actually discerned anything clearly at all. I think what it will come down to is not a pile of actual eveidence – descriptions and paintings – on each side of the argument, but a more nuanced discussion as to what each describer or artist was putting into his recreation.The Lier copy is often considered one of the oldest and one of the most accurate depictions of the Shroud pre-1532. Some details are more accurate than many other copies or depictions from much later – so why did the artist get the shape of the head so wrong, miss out most of the very visible bloodstains altogether, draw three clear strands of hair spreading over the back of the head, and over-accentuate the darkness of the hair and buttocks. Is that what he saw?People who think the Shroud was as it is now, and quote the Lier copy as their ‘proof’ have an obligation to explain these anomalies. Perhaps the Lier painter saw, but omitted the blood for reasons of his own. People who use the Lier copy to suggest that the Shroud was different still have to account for alterations, such as the shape of the head or the absence of blood, which cannot be due to the paint falling off. The much derided Picknett and Prince used the Lier shroud to ‘prove’ that the one we see now cannot have been the one the Lier artist painted, which was destroyed and replaced, much later, by Leonardo da Vinci. On the basis of that evidence alone it would be difficult to gainsay them.Similarly, pious descriptions of the Shroud can either be taken as forensically accurate or imaginative reconstructions. Anyone who saw what he believed was really his saviour’s face on a cloth, in contrast to the many paintings he had seen, might well feel, quite sincerely, that it was brighter than it was, but on the other hand it is strange that nobody at all seems to have recorded that the image was actually barely visible – a strange case of the emperor’s new clothes!Now, what was the question?

Uncertainties there certainly are, and I have been attempting to understand his methodology to try to clarify them. Two particular difficulties are his unrealistic identification of his pollen right down to species level, and the unrealistic proportions of the various types of plant identified. I think his main problem was the lack of reference material with which to compare the grains he found. To counter this, he went several times to collect reference material from places he thought might be relevant. Now this next bit is speculation, but I think he then compared his grains with the reference material collected, and where he found a match, identified the pollen as from that species. This is a mistake. Pollen is not as individually shaped as he thought, and even today very few grains can be identified at species level; the family is as good as most palynologists can get, and families of plants are much more widely distributed, of course, than species. I think that had Frei gone to, say, South America or Japan for his reference specimens, he would have had no less difficulty in finding 50 or so matches, even though the list of species would have been entirely different! This scenario could also account for the unrealistic proportions of types of plants, as it is easier to collect pollen from a brightly coloured flower (entomophilous) than from an undistinguished, possibly difficult to find, even difficult to reach, catkin (wind-borne), and plants from the same family can include both types.","date":"August 1, 2014 at 10:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/28/a-new-paper-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A New Paper by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I did indeed read your comment, and those of others, especially Thibaut (at another post), and although I can’t agree that the early copies “strongly” suggest the image was faint, there is something in what you say.

The secularity of these plays seems to have been stimulated by Pope Innocent III’s edict against clergy acting on a public stage in 1210. For these, there were any number of props, from the mouth of Hell to the jaws of Jonah’s whale, and, for the passion, spears, crowns of thorns, tombs, shrouds, hammers, nails and pincers, to name but a few.

Paintings which are clearly copies of the Shroud show the body without, then with, then without. They are pretty variable about which hand crossed over which, the position of the feet, and the details of the bloodflows as well. Either the artists were relying on the reports or sketches of others, or these details were not important enough to be correctly reported, or sensibility to convention made them ‘get it wrong.’ I think Charles’s point here is that the loincloth only occurs at a particular time in the Shroud’s history, and then only (by coincidence) when there was a particular taboo against ecclesiastical nudity. Such temporary additions were quite common – the loincloth could have been deliberately made temporary and easy to remove – it could even have been a separate piece of material stitched on – or could have only appeared in artists’ copies and depictions of the expositions.“Why would someone paint a negative image?” This is a reasonable question and, as far as I know, there are no other negative images of this sort in existence today. There are also no other double portraits of Christ, head to head, on long thin sheets. However, as Charles has pointed out, there was at some point quite an extensive tradition of re-enactment of the Quem Quaeritis scene from the bible, numerous accounts of which survive, all of which involved a shroud which was taken from a symbolic tomb and exhibited to the congregation. There must have been dozens of shrouds, not one of which survives, except possibly the Shroud of Turin. Perhaps some of the others also depicted the image of Christ, and perhaps they too showed him as accurately as they could, leaving marks where his body touched the cloth, but not where it didn’t. Sure, it’s a guess, but it’s not an unreasonable one.Some years ago, Picknett and Prince published the idea that the Shroud was a photo by Leonardo da Vinci. They were mostly criticised, with similar abuse to that above, for being so stupid as to attribute a cloth well known in 1355, to a man who was born in 1452. Even a cursory glance at their research would have shown that they claimed the modern Shroud was a copy of the original, but few of their intemperate opponents seem to have read much more than the back cover. As it happens I think their theory is incorrect, but I did read it all the way through. Before anybody else starts usng words like “absurd,” “bad will,” and “plagiarism,” for Charles, might I suggest they respond to what his article says rather than what they think it might say based on an abstract.For me, the value of Charles’s paper is that he suggests a context, with which I was not familiar, within which the Shroud could have fitted, and which must have involved numerous similar shrouds with which it could be compared. What we need to do now is to find some!","date":"October 18, 2014 at 3:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Although neither Herbert Thurston nor Ulysse Chevalier thought that the Shroud was authentic, and both used the D’Arcis letters as evidence against authenticity, I think they differed quite sharply about what it actually was. Chevalier, I think, had an anti-relic agenda to foster, and was keen to prove that the Shroud had indeed been designed to deceive people into thinking it was genuine when it wasn’t, but Thurston was much more directed towards the use of artifacts in the Easter Liturgy, and, as Charles has suggested, thought the Shroud was one of those.However, I have thought of a bit of a problem with Charles’s thesis. If ‘shrouds’ were part of a common annual liturgy, stored in their dozens in sacristies across Europe, how come ‘our’ Shroud suddenly appears as an object of special reverence? Was it brought from an area where the ‘Quem Quaeritis’ ceremony was common to a place where it was wholly unknown? Or had the ritual declined for years, and most of the old impedimenta discarded, and the Shroud resurfaced after a period of dormancy? If the Shroud was part of a ‘Quem Quaeritis’ ceremony, however, the famous ‘poker holes’ become much easier to understand. The ritual specifically states that three clergy, all swinging censors, go to the symbolic tomb, lift out the cloth, return it to the altar and unfold it for all to revere. The folding of the coth into four (to fit in the ‘tomb’), and the possibility of scattered charcoal, seem to fit this scenario rather well.I’m looking for Thomas’s and OK’s ‘number of flaws’ to Charles’s article, as this is how good scientists test their own, as well as others’, hypotheses. But what a pity. The most forceful of their arguments is that the article is ‘garbage,’ ‘rubbish,’ and deliberate lies (Or as OK puts it, LIES, and in bold too). I note that Thomas has ‘little time for non-thinking authenticists.’ Generous to a fault, I continued the search and I have found something less abusive. First there is the loincloth issue, as mentioned above. Charles is apparently attempting to reconcile the coincidence of a loincloth-enveloped shroud with eccesiastical views about nudity. If the loinclothed shroud and the prohibition are indeed contemporaneous, and if the shroud is always depicted nude outside the period of prohibition, then a valid connection can be made between them. If the actual Shroud were exhibited at that time, then it would have had to be covered itself, just as any representation of it would have to be. Furthermore, Thomas’s implication that copies of the exposition would have to have a loincoth (‘because that was the artistic convention, being highly distasteful to show Christ’s buttocks’) but not the Shroud itself, publicly exposed to thousands, is inconsistent. Thomas’s contention that “the fact that the earliest depiction of the Shroud – Lier in 1516 – does not show a loin cloth, is close to fatal for his theory” is clearly wrong, as it is entirely consistent with a loincloth being added later, and a clear demonstration that it was not always ‘highly distasteful to show Christ’s buttocks’.Secondly, Thomas queries the inconsistency between the very visible artistic representations of the image, and the near invisibility of the image itself. Is this because of artistry, and the difficulty of showing the true image on a painting/engraving, or because the image really was much clearer in earlier times? This is a difficult question. Some authenticists think that the image has actually got clearer over the years, ‘developing’ like a photograph, and some non-authenticists think that the image was clearly painted (or photographed), but that the paint or other medium has flaked off, leaving only the deteriorated linen behind. One way of finding out is to read what people said they saw, rather than looking at artistic representations.  As far as I can recall, almost all pre-20th century accounts say how clear and distinct the image is, adding some evidence in favour of Charles’s view. He quotes some of them in his article.O.K., eventually, having firmly nailed his colours to the ‘I don’t care what he says; I don’t like him so he must be wrong’ mast, finally gets round to disputing Charles description of the images on the shroud, which is a valid criticism. All the measurements of the images are imprecise, inconsistencies between the front and the back are variously accounted for the posture of the body and the wrapping of the cloth, and similar problems arise in attempting to correlate the measurements of the image with the measurements of the man who might have made it. Latendre, above, makes the point well. However, since the time of Vignon and Barbet, who saw only perfect proportions to the body, even the most ardent authenticists have found themselves having to account for observed inconsistencies, and those non-authenticists who think they can all be accounted for by clumsy artistry, have greatly enoyed watching them wriggle. It is not inconsistent with Charles’s argument to claim that the Shroud does not obviously show a perfectly proportioned body, or pair of bodies.","date":"October 19, 2014 at 6:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Good quotes, but the Pope certainly does not speak for the Catholic Church except in very rare circumstances, and although the first four Popes you quote I believe did personally believe that the shroud is authentic, I am less certain about the last three (including Pope Francis), and do not feel that that their public pronouncements are as clear regarding their personal opinions as you think.

(I’ve been Googling) From newspaper reports, it is usually very difficult to tell whether a ‘scientific discovery’ is anything of the sort, and a couple of articles entitled ‘Noah’s Ark found in Turkey’ or ‘Shroud is genuine say scientists’ are equally likely to be so clumsily reported that to rely on them to formulate one’s opinion is extremely unwise. The reader is more likely to be persuaded by previous prejudice or the reputation of the media than anything claimed in the article. So, what to do? I turn to things like Google Scholar to see what I can find. For “Turin Shroud” the first dozen or so entries include papers from Applied Optics, the Journal of Optics, Accounts of Chemical Research, and the Journal of Imaging Science and Technology. For “Noah’s Ark” there is virtually nothing. Nearly all the ‘science’ of the Shroud can be found online, in accounts by its researchers and discoverers. All the ‘science’ of Noah’s Ark is second hand and primary sources are very difficult to track down.Be that as it may, I discovered something else, which is that the discovery of Noah’s Ark has been the subject of a court case. How often have books on the Shroud, or comments on this blog, included fanciful ideas involving ‘trials’, ‘judgements’ or ‘verdicts’? Well, in 1997, Noah’s Ark was actually subject to judicial proceedings. A professor of geology sued a lecturer for misrepresenting the discovery of Noah’s Ark as fact, when it was no such thing. Sadly, in spite of various arguments for and against, the lecturer’s lectures were not considered as “Trading” under the provisions of the “Fair Trade Act,” so he was not able to have breached it, regardless of the content of what he said, although the judge did say that the lecturer has used “misleading and deceptive conduct” in claiming various scientific truths which were no such thing.","date":"July 23, 2015 at 7:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/because-if-it-looks-unbelievable/","cat":"article","title":"Because If It Looks Unbelievable"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“Don’t you reproduce a typo, please!” I copied and pasted your own words, Max.

Let’s recap.1) Your hypothesis is that Bishop d’Arcis used the word ‘depinxerat’ to mean ‘he had copied from one image to another’ even though there is no instance of the word ever being used in that sense elsewhere.2) Your hypothesis is that Bishop d’Arcis used the word in that unique sense because an available word; ‘copio, copiare’ had no perfect or pluperfect form in 1390. However your evidence for this was a reference to a different word altogether, the deponent verb ‘copior, copiari.’I understood that, and found your hypothesis fanciful and your evidence erroneous.Now I get confused. First you say you have found ‘copiavi’ and ‘copiavit’, forms of the perfect tense of ‘copio’ in connection with the 14th century Pope Urban V, and in the following sentence “NO pluperfect active indicative of the verb copiare, NO perfect and pluperfect active indicatives of the medieval Latin verb copio, “to reproduce, to copy” appears then.” Surely ‘copiavi’ and ‘copiavit’ are indeed forms of the perfect active indicative of the verb ‘copio, copiare, copiavi, copiatum’.Finally, you say: “The Latin verb copio, “to copy” as synonym of copiare does exist”, and link to a page about the verb ‘copio, copiare’ as if you thought the two words were synonyms, rather than different forms of the same word, ‘copio’ being the 1st person present indicative and ‘copiare’ the present infinitive. ‘Copio’ means ‘I copy’ and ‘copiare’ means ‘to copy’.I think the bottom line is that if d’Arcis had wished to say that one shroud was a copy of another there were conventional ways of doing so other than the unique use of the word ‘depinxerat’, and the fact that he did use the word ‘depinxerat’ indicates that he did not wish to say any such thing.","date":"May 6, 2015 at 1:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Quite possibly.","date":"April 30, 2015 at 9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Excellent.

It is apparent, as I think you agree, that copio, copiare, copiavi, copiatum existed as a regular verb in medieval times. The perfect stem ‘copiav-‘ has been attested by yourself in connection with Pope Urban V, an Avignon Pope approximately contemoprary to the correspondence between d’Arcis and another Avignon Pope a few years later. It is not necessary to find an actual example of every form of a verb for it to be ‘available’ for use if required. In the entire internet, nobody has ever used the form “we will have Googled”, but the form has been listed several times in computer-generated lists of possible forms of the verb to Google.I do not agree that “he had copied” was of “extremely current use” nor that it should necessarily have been. If people had wanted to say “he had copied” they would have said it, in one way or another, either using copiaverat or some other word, but in fact neither alternative is found. In all medieval Latin literature there is no reference to a painting having been copied by a copyist using any translation of “he had copied”.Your last post is muddled. D’Arcis and the Pope thought the Shroud of Lirey was a representation of the true shroud of Christ, not the actual thing. It was not a copy or a reproduction of the real shroud, as there was no original from which to copy it, but an reconstruction of what the real shroud might have been like.You are misleading in claiming that the Latin word ‘representatio’ means ‘copy’ or reproduction,’ without recognising its primary meaning as ‘representation.’ The first two imply a physical original from which a copy or reproduction may be made, but the primary meaning does not require such an original, and may as well derive from a description.

However it must be said that various full size sheets with at least some resemblance to the Shroud have been produced by painting (Nickell himself), photography (Allen and Wilson) and acid degradation (Garlaschelli), while nothing more than a couple of centimetres has been produced by vaporography (Vignon), lasers (di Lazzaro), or coronal discharge (Fanti). Attempts to upscale these experiments have either failed completely, or not attempted because the energy required would be outside the realm of science.2) “The Rev. Andrew Dalton, a Legionaries of Christ priest who’s a shroud expert.” Why? What makes one a Shroud Expert? What makes Dalton’s suggestions more credible than anybody else’s? I’m not just carping; it’s important, because this is what he says:3) “There are details that simply couldn’t have been forged centuries ago.

Just being an Expert?4) “Dalton also insists that the samples dating to the Middle Ages were taken from patches added to the cloth after it was damaged by a fire, and he said that other experts caution that ancient cloths often date later in radiocarbon analysis than their actual origins due to bacterial contamination.” This could just be clumsy reporting, but I do hope Dalton insists no such thing.However I like the way the reporter has summarised both Nickell’s and Barrie Schwortz’s points, especially:Nickell: “The “blood” has failed a battery of tests by internationally known forensic serologists.”Schwortz: “The bloodstains were chemically tested and determined to be actual blood.”Both, of course, perfectly true statements, and wholly contradictory, like so much of the evidence of the Shroud.

First, the image must be sufficiently ‘negative’ and shaded to be able to produce an approximate 3D image, second the image must be confined to the upper fibres of the cloth and to be transparent to transmitted light, thirdly, the image must be achievable by conventional medieval science or conventional dead body/cloth interaction. To omit any one of these areas scientifically in favour of miraculous intervention is a bit of a cop out.Just recently I have been pleased and surprised to read Pope Francis’s recent speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, where he emphasised the rationality of the Catholic faith (something dear to Pope Benedict too), saying “God is not a demiurge or a magician” and encouraging their work on evolution and the origin of the universe.

Lewis and Short, those heroes of our youth, very helpfully give dozens of references for the two words, many of which can be checked in context.While depingere almost certainly means to “paint from,” the sense of “copy” as of one image to another, is wholly absent in all them. It means, as its derivation does now, “depict.” If representing a person or scene onto a flat surface is copying, then I am happy for you to use the word in that sense, but it is some way removed from the idea that the Shroud complained about by d’Arcis was a copy of another Shroud.","date":"May 5, 2015 at 7:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, of course I can, Max; it’s a pleasure.

Scientist is what scientist does in, my opinion, and although even Colin would admit that to a layman, a bloke in a kitchen smearing flour on his face seems very different from a bloke in a university laboratory with a squillion-volt laser, it seems that both these gentlemen have achieved a discolouration of the upper fibrils of a cloth which at least visually, even under a microscope, has many of the characteristics of the Shroud. Daveb’s gentle ribbing of Colin’s work by saying that there is no idea so preposterous that some scientist doesn’t promote it is fair enough, but we must remember that this swings both ways. John Jackson has impeccable scientific credentials, but his current attempts at explaining the ‘fall through’ hypothesis make Colin’s experiments appear the very essence of respectability.Bob Brockie, who ought to have known better, made the popular journalist error of describing anyone who uses the words ‘quantum’, ‘hologram, or even ‘UFO’ as, by definition a scientist.

For ‘ossuaries’ we should read ‘tombs’ and there is a very important difference, statistically, as we shall see.According to Pfann, in “Demythologyzing the Talpiot Tomb” (http://www.uhl.ac/files/9813/4840/4067/TalpiotTombAnalysisSJP3a.pdf), in an “overall census of inscribed ossuaries” there were 286 names, of which 10 were Jesus and 19 were Joseph. For reasons unexplained, Pfann reduces the 286 total to 214, which is the total number of the most numerous 16 names. Of the 214, 144 are male and 70 are female. This gives 7% called Jesus and 13% called Joseph. Assuming the two names are unconnected, the probability of being a “Jesus, son of Joseph” is 7% x 13% which is roughly 1%. However, since a tomb might be said to have an average of ten ossuaries in it, the probability that a tomb contains a “Jesus, son of Joseph” is back to 10%. One in ten.Actually the reduction of 286 to 214 is not justified. Assuming a similar proportion of males to females though, there would be a total of 196 males and 90 females, and thence 5% Jesus and 10% Joseph, and (if we may still assume 10 ossuaries per tomb), a probability of there being a Jesus son of Joseph actually more like 5% than 10%. Of course, some tombs were built to contain up to 16 ossuaries, and some ossuaries contained bones from more than one body, so these figures can be juggled a bit to suit, but at least we have laid to rest the idea that 10% of the male population of Israel were ‘Jesus son of Joseph.’","date":"April 7, 2015 at 5:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/05/easter-ink/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Easter Ink"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Why?

However, there are a few who seem to think that, having convincing evidence of the Shroud’s inauthenticity, then any counter evidence can be rejected without being considered on its own merits. Joe Nickell seems to be doing it here. He cannot be accused of ignoring counter evidence, but his conclusions give me the impression that he rejects it ‘because it must be false’, and not because of its internal inconsistencies. If the Shroud is not authentic, then he is correct that it is false, but anyone interested in getting to the bottom of the mystery would surely want to find out why.One of Joe’s arguments is that “A secret commission appointed in 1969 to study the shroud examined the “blood” stains, which are suspiciously picturelike and still red. Internationally known forensic serologists reported that the red substance failed all microscopical, chemical, biological, and instrumental tests for blood. Instead, there were reddish granules that would not even dissolve in reagents that dissolve blood.” He knows very well that as long as the reddish granules did not dissolve, then of course all the tests for blood would fail. What he ignores here is that the 1978 scientists did manage to dissolve the reddish granules, and performed a number of tests which they said indicated the presence of blood. Some sort of discussion is required to resolve this apparent contradiction, but Joe does not engage in it.On the other hand, Leon is not doing the authenticist cause any favours by spouting the old “if you can’t do it your way, it must have been done my way” mantra.","date":"April 25, 2015 at 8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/25/flat-earth-society-shroud-of-turin-research-project-sturp-and-other-partisans/","cat":"article","title":"Flat Earth Society, Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and Other Partisans"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Interesting, David.

What is more surprising is the pollen that comes from plants that bloom in autumn.2) Prof. Danin has also identified the imprints of a number of plants on the Shroud, most notably Chrysanthemum coronarium, and ‘an almost continuous carpet of flowers […] most similar in shape and size to flowering heads of Matricaria recutita or Anthemis bornmuelleri.’ None of these is represented in his pollen list.3) As most of the pollen is entomophilous, it must have arrived by the flowers being placed on the Shroud. There is very sparse archaeological evidence that this was common practice, no biblical suggestion that any such thing occurred, and gives us an interesting vision of various holy people rushing around the environs of Jerusalem to gather about 20 different species of flowers, some of which only grow on the shores of the Dead Sea, and most of which are extremely unattractive.I do not dispute that there is pollen on the Shroud, but, rather like the cotton fibre enthusiasts, until there is rather more explanation and agreement among the palynologists, I cannot consider the evidence convincing.","date":"April 26, 2015 at 7:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/25/flat-earth-society-shroud-of-turin-research-project-sturp-and-other-partisans/","cat":"article","title":"Flat Earth Society, Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and Other Partisans"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Fair enough.

It is a review of some microspectrum photometry carried out on “less than a dozen possible bloodstained fibrils and a single brownish red translucent crystal.”The first mention of bilirubin in connection with the Shroud seems to be in ‘A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin’, Heller and Adler, 1981. “Characteristic blue azobilirubin colors could be positively detected in reflected light on the surfaces of the olive coloured shards, the orange globs, and, also, weakly on the more orange colored red coated fibrils.” The redder coloured fibrils are specifically excluded from this analysis.Another roughly contemporaneous paper, “The Origin and Nature of Blood on the Turin Shroud”, which I can only find in ‘The Orphaned Manuscript”, goes in more detail into the bilirubin content, based on the microspectrum photometry previously mentioned. “There is an extraordinarily high bilirubin count, almost as high as the methemoglobin.” There is no explanation of how this was derived, and it is not apparent to me, after studying the spectrum as illustrated in the 1980 paper.

This is in order to explain not the minor irregularities of the face, but the complete absence of anything representing the flanks or sides of the legs, and also the precision of the features and the mathematical intensity-distance relationship, which requires collimated emission to make any sense at all. Giovanna de Liso’s discoveries regarding earthquake images are in need of verification, but there is precious little else scientific that bears credence.In his paper, OK attempts to demonstrate that the Shroud shows a minor version of the Agamemnon face effect, by manipulating the width of the face to fit his hypothesis. On Page 17 (“Let’s compare the results”) he says that by removing the weave and the banding, the Shroud face appears wider. Actually it appears wider because it has been stretched sideways by about 5%. On Page 18 (“3D Comparison”), where we are told the image on the right looks “much more realistic”, it has been stretched by nearly 20%, and on Page 23, to show how well the Shroud fits the Agamemnon mask (“Yeah!”) it is widened by over 30%. If the real Shroud were remoulded into a 3D figure in the same way that can be done with the mask, it would be seen to represent a wholly anatomically impossible human head. OK’s confidence in his paper is, in my opinion, overstated.","date":"October 17, 2015 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, I think I understand your point.

Nothing could be further from the truth. I think I understand your paper thoroughly, but cannot derive the same conclusions as yourself. Firstly, can we ignore the ludicrous dimensions you quote? The Mask of Agamemnon is life size, not a few millimetres in each direction, and it is roughly as wide as it is high. The reproduction in Valladolid is 25cm x 28cm, and one in New York is 26cm x 25cm. However, the most important dimension is not the height or width, but the third. If the mask was laid flat on a table, how high would the nose be above the table surface? The Met Museum copy gives this as 7cm. A cloth pulled tightly over the mask, in a straight line from ear to nose to ear would be three or four centimetres wider than the mask, and if it was loosely draped it would be even wider. If the Shroud does indeed exactly match the width of the Mask (or of a theoretical body), then it cannot have been draped over it. It must have been more or less horizontal, and the image therefore projected vertically. Far be it from me to insinuate anything. I measured, and requested my readers to measure, the dimensions of the various copies of the Shroud you reproduce in your paper, often side by side, as on Pages 17,18 and 23. The image gets progressively wider and wider in proportion to its height, as specified. You are very welcome to check this for yourself; after all, its your paper. The progressive distortion, which incidentally fits your hypothesis of a loosely draped cloth, may be an inadvertent artefact of the pdf, but it cannot be denied that it is there.","date":"October 17, 2015 at 5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"I still do not clearly follow your reasoning. Your own measurements from the ingenious Lavoie image of a cloth superimposed on a man show that while an actual width of the face is 8.8cm, a contact image produced by such a drape would be 12.2cm, an increase in width of nearly a third. Is this what you call a ‘minor distortion’? Is so, then I do follow your reasoning, but simply disagree that increasing the width of an image by a third is a minor distortion. Other people have suggested that the actual width of 8.8cm is represented by a vertical transmission image which is also 8.8cm. This would come about if the cloth were held flat above the body.I do not know how deliberate – perhaps not at all – the different widths of the face in your paper are. Here are the ones I was referring to.Your comment about Cyrano de Bergerac is silly. The Agememnon mask, laid on a table, projects 7cm above the table, as I said. It is about 25cm across. In simple mathematical terms, an equilateral  triangle 25cm across and 7cm high has diagonal sides of 28.6cm. A cloth stretched tight across the face would be that wide. If it were more loosely draped it would be wider still. How is this observation nonsense?Finally, checking things with calipers and a tape measure, I find that the distance measured by a tape measure across my nose from ear to ear is well over 25% more than the distance measured directly using calipers.

Mario Latendresse found that a cloth draped over a head face was 28% wider than the head, but Ercoline found that the image on the Shroud was only 6% wider than a head. Therefore the Shroud could not have been formed by a ‘shortest path’ mechanism, and something more like a vertical mechanism would fit the measurements better. Both Latendresse and Ercoline make this explicit. As far as I know you are alone in maintaining that the vertical transmission hypothesis is impossible on measurement grounds alone, although there are good reasons for suggesting that it is impossible in terms of the physics of radiation.","date":"October 19, 2015 at 4:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"OK may disagree with the “majority of the authenticists” (I do myself, but for different reasons), but I think that collimated transmission, and that vertically up and down, is indeed what the “majority of the authenticists” believe.It is convenient to take measurements of the Shroud from Shroud Scope. Readers are invited to take a couple, of their own choice, one vertical and one horizontal, and calculate the ratio between the two. Repeating those measurements using the image immediately above OK’s in the paper he quoted, they will find that the width of the Shroud has been considerably increased. They will therefore be surprised to find that the image of the Shroud immediately above this post is correctly proportioned. In this case, however, they should measure the image of the Mask of Agamemnon, both in the original paper and above, when they will find that the mask has been considerably narrowed from what it was in the paper!How extraordinary. I order to reconcile these problems we must remember that the Shroud is, of course, flat, but the mask of Agamamnon, although its ears have been squashed outwards, is not at all flat, but maintains its original “face profile” rather well. See, for example, the three-quarter profile at http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/mask-of-agamemnon-2-bob-christopher.jpg.So, apart from the ears, the flat Shroud neatly reproduces the curved face of Agamemnon. This is not evidence for any kind of drape, but rather for the vertical radiation hypothesis OK rejects.I am intrigued by the statement, “the transmission certainly wasn’t vertical.” If the darkness/distance correlation exists at all, it is important that whatever emerged from the body at a specific point was represented on the cloth at a specific point. OK admits that if the radiation is not collimated this “theoretically may result in multiple images of the same body points”. Quite so. If the transmission is perpendicular to the surface of the body or the surface of the Shroud, then some parts of the Shroud would receive no radiation at all, and not darken, while other parts would receive radiation from several places, and therefore darken more than they would if they only received radiation from only one place. The sides of the nose, for example, would be dark, but this is not what is observed on the Shroud. OK actually says of his 4 diagrams of possible transmission that “all 4 ways give similar results.” So, how can he be so dogmatic that “the transmission certainly wasn’t vertical”?","date":"October 17, 2015 at 1:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well, I think we’ll have to leave it at that. Now that you seem to agree that the heads in your paper were distorted widthwise, and produce two heads of the same proportion above, the upper one looks a good deal more realistic to me, but not to you. It’s a matter of opinion.Although a mathematically calculated triangle shows a 14% increase in length via the two angled sides – not a major distortion perhaps – the Latendresse practical equivalent shows a 28% increase, which I do consider a major distortion. Maybe you don’t. it’s a matter of opinion.I know the papers you refer to well. The old Ercoline and Jackson paper is extremely detailed, and compares 23 measurements of a set of 98 living people with their equivalents on the Shroud. Without going into the uncertainties of this exercise (how you make a precise measurement involving the elbows or nipples of the Shroud image, for example), I can be seen that Ercoline and Jackson find that in only 5 cases does the Shroud measurement exceed the human measurement by more than 10%. These are in two hip-width measurements, two finger-length measurements and a forearm measurement (with all the uncertainty of not knowing where the elbow is).The only two face-width measurements show that the Shroud image is 6% and 8% wider than the equivalent human width respectively. This is interpreted as indicating some distortion. However, as it is wholly insufficient to be produced by a loosely draped cloth covering a real head, the authors come to the conclusion that: “The character of the distortions and some anomalies of the image seem to be best explained by a vertical mapping process.” I agree with Ercoline. You don’t.

The light sides of the face between the cheeks and hair are irregular in shape and do not extend upwards or downwards beyond the upper hairline or down in the chest.

In a general “is-it-or-isn’t-it?” piece, then it is necessary to present as many arguments on both sides as you know, assess their value, and decide on balance one way or the other. But in a more specific case: “find a context for a 14th century shroud” or “could an earthquake have contributed to a 1st century shroud” then, apart from an acknowledgement that not everybody agrees with your premise, it is simply a waste of space to re-iterate all the arguments for or against it. Charles acknowledges: “There is enough uncertainty about the Shroud’s origins to convince some that it is the actual burial shroud of Christ,” and moves on. So should the reader, but Jones devotes another 12% of his article to his computer-hacker argument. Why bother?A further 13% is devoted to Charles’ credentials as an expert. This is a very weak form of criticism of an article, which ought to stand or fall by what it says, not on the reputation of its author.In some of his criticism, Steve is on slightly surer ground. Thibault, on this blog, for example, has successfully challenged Charles suggestion that the image was never depicted with a loincloth before the Council of Trent. I think Charles is also a little unfair is supposing that no-one has considered the kind of loom upon which the cloth may have been woven. John Tyrer’s article at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi06part6.pdf considers this quite well, acknowledging that both the Z-twist and early 4-headle looms are typically European, casting doubt on a 1st century Middle Eastern origin, without, of course, positively disproving it. William Meacham, without giving sources, at http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm, says: “The thread was hand-spun and hand-loomed; after ca. 1200, most European thread was spun on the wheel.” Elsewhere we find: “Textile analysis suggests that the cloth originated in First Century Israel and that it was produced on a Syrian or Egyptian loom used during the time of the Roman occupation of Palestine. It appears to be identical to unique linen cloth found at the Masada fortress.” (Quoted, for example, at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/porter1.pdf) As far as I know there is not a shred of truth in this entire statement, but if I’m wrong it suggests that some quality research into the textile has indeed been carried out.

Any credibiility I have acquired in the scientific field comes from the research I have not only read, but quoted with references, and the reasonability of the inferences I make from them.  Your credibility depends on the same.You begin by airily announcing that there is evidence of early herringbone weave on the basis of a 1st Century silver vessel showing a character wearing a striped costume with faint alternating diagonal hatching on the stripes, the embroidery on some epitaphioi, the base of carved alabaster throne and Christ’s robe in a miniature. Your expertise lies in knowing of these artifacts and being able to demonstrate them with references, for which we thank you, but we need not agree that they all illustrate herringbone cloth, or demonstrate that it was manufactured prior to the 14th century. I don’t, for one.Had you stuck to the Stavronitika epitaphios you could have been on stronger ground. After all, here is a picture of a Shroud with a herringbone pattern, and here is the actual Shroud which has a herringbone weave. There is a logical inference. It is not proof, or a true fact, that the one derives from the other, but it is a sensible infererence. There are counter-indications. The Stavronitika herringbone pattern is at rightangles with respect to the Shroud’s weave, and the Thessaloniki epitaphios shows herringbone embroidery as a general filler for any blank spaces, such as the sky, angels’ halos and so on. (The Stavronitika one leaves the sky unfilled)Next you wrote: “On 1988 radiocarbon dating, ‘sample 4′ was lift off the Cope of Saint Louis d’Anjou (1274-1297), a 13th c. CE ‘linen three-in-one’!” which you amended five hours later to “Reminder three: the Cope of Saint Louis d’Anjou (1274-1297), a 13th c. CE does combine linen herringbone and three in one and could be mistaken for the TS to the uninitiated eye.” This is only partially true, as Gian Marco later demonstrated: Linen – Yes, Herringbone – Yes, but ‘three in one’ – No. The herringbone is in embroidery stitching, not weaving, and looks nothing like 3/1 twill.Now we come to the Grandson antependium. Rather similarly to the Stavronitika epitaphios, large areas are left unembroidered, but over the embroidered area, herringbone is used as a convenient space-filler. The archangel Michael has collar, wings, halo, hem of tunic, sash and a thin central panel of his tunic in herringbone. None of them resembles a loros. He is carrying a cloth over one arm. It is not embroidered in herringbone. Not only the angels, but also a couple of insense burners are also embroidered in herringbone. Not, I think, to represent cloth.Now Max, everybody who reads this will be able to look up all these things on Google, and check that everything I have described is true. They will admire my dedication, agree that my inferences are valid, but come to their own conclusions about whether they agree with me. Some will, some won’t. That’s how ‘being an expert’ works.

I think a lesson is exactly what you need, so here goes.=====The Wikipedia article on the Loros explains that it went through considerable modification. It began as a long stole looped over the neck or shoulders. The shorter end dropped down the front almost to the floor, and the longer end crossed around the back and ended up draped over the left arm. The Byzantine illustrations in the article do not show quite how the crossing round the back was accomplished. Over the course of the 11th to 13th centuries the design was modified so that the two hanging ends dropped from a wide collar. Again, the long end fell down the front, but got shorter, but the long end still came forward from behind and was draped over the left arm as before. By the 14th century the whole thing may have been sewn to the tunic beneath, but there was invariably a hanging over the left arm.The Grandson archangel, dated about 1270, has nothing over his left arm. No loros. He does have the collar and dropping front strip, but there is no indication that his wide sash, the hem of his tunic, or the cloth over his right arm, are part of a loros. They could be stylistic elements derived from a loros, but not, as such, a loros itself.For a full discussion of the development of the loros from the Roman (pre-Christian) toga and its later adoption of the symbolism of the shroud of Christ, see, for example, pages 153 – 156 in the Chapter on “Imperial Costume and Regalia” in the “Catalogue of the Byzantine Coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection” which is on Google Books.=====There.","date":"October 30, 2014 at 8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi Thibault.

By stretching the second image, the truth of his contention cannot be ascertained. His caption:”What can be seen at first glance is that the right one is much broader” is true because it has been stretched widthwise, not because of the removal of the bands. The images on page 18 are even more grotesque, showing the ‘original’ as much narrower than it really is, and the ‘adjusted’ one much too wide. By the time we get to a mapping of the shroud onto the Agamemnon mask, the images has been distorted so much it clearly looks as if it has been wrapped around a head from ear to ear, but this is entirely due to the aspect ratio, and nothing to do with the removal or adjustment of the bands.OK is correct that Latendresse conjectures (his word) that the image formation was created by a ‘shortest route’ process, but his study does not involve such a process, and he explicitly uses vertical transmission instead. In the Abstract he says: “If a cloth is appropriately laid on the front part of a body,and a body image forms by a vertical projection on the cloth, no major image distortions occur.” In the Introduction he says: “the Shroud was not ﬂattened, yet a real body – assuming a simple vertical projection – can have made these images without creating major image distortions.” The second of his Major Assumptions is: “2. The images formed by a mechanism that reproduces each point by a vertical projection, from the body to the Shroud.” And further on: “Our analyses assume a ‘straight vertical projection’ from the body, to form the images. Several other projections have been analyzed: perpendicular to the sheet, perpendicular to the skin and non-collimated (dispersive). Ercoline et al. argue that the vertical projection avoids most image distortions whereas the others do not. We agree that the vertical projection should create the least amount of image distortions (among the above-mentioned projections).”One of the problems in this discussion is that the Shroud man has no ears, and the exact position of the hair is difficult to be precise about. If, as it appears, the hair forms a close frame around the face, in the same approximate plane as the cheeks, as if the face was framed in a kind of ‘box’ of hair, then the Shroud was indeed pretty flat, even when loosely draped. However, if the hair is in two lengths covering the ears, then the image is far too narrow to come from a loosely draped cloth.","date":"October 20, 2015 at 5:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"“I DID specify the BYZANTINE LOROS here is REVISITED THROUGH A WESTERNER’S EYE who literally identified the loros with Christ’s herringbone patterned burial cloth.” No, you didn’t.

Like the head-to-head double image, which lacks either artistic or archaeological context, the weave of the Shroud seems to lack technological context. We can laugh, but OK is correct in supposing that by sticking to these precise criteria, the Shroud clearly does not exist at all! So what to do? We have to loosen our parameters, I believe. By letting go of some of the details above, we may find cloths which, although not identical, at least bear some comparison. The V&A fragment shows at least some of the Shroud’s characteristics, and it may be that some early Egyptian fabrics show others. Indian silks may show still others. I don’t think any of these can be rejected simply because they are not identical.I think that is as far as I can go without the advice of someone with an extensive experience of medieval or 1st Century (preferably both) weaving, who can come to a decision of their own, and explain why they have done so, and why they reject the alternative.

That’s all. Rogers’s comments about the spectrographs do not include anything about one containing cotton and one exclusively linen, or one containing vanillin and one not, or one containing madder and one not, or one being older than the other. As to the possibility of invisible weaving, I think I have said all I can without having an example done for me, and have sent two samples of cloth to two different invisible menders to be mended invisibly, so that I can observe, photograph, and demonstrate to anybody that invisible weaving is not invisible under a microscope. I have never seen any evidence for invisible weaving, let alone the invisible weaving itself.Shroud 2.0 is sufficient to show individual threads, and clearly shows where the odd thread here and there has been extracted, there is no evidence to show that any ‘invisible’ repair has been made. Anybody with Shroud 2.0 who thinks they have found an example should screengrab and post it forthwith!

All he has been attempting over the last eight years or so is to reproduce a surface degradation of linen similar to that apparently observed on the Shroud, by means of electromagnetic radiation. Infra-red radiation (heat) could produce the right colour, but the heat generated within the fibres by the effects of the radiation damaged the threads in a dissimilar way to the Shroud. Radiation at 10.6 micrometres having failed to produce the desired outcome, radiation at 0.3 micrometres, and then 0.2 micrometres was tried instead, generated by an XeCl and an ArF laser respectively, of which the first was found less satisfactory than the second.The problem is a little like cooking a rare steak, when a very high temperature is required for a very short time, in order to brown the surface without overcooking the inside. Very hot, very fast, is the answer, but even with the ArF laser, if the pulse was short, insufficient energy was transferred, but if the pulse was long, the penetration of the cloth was too deep. The answer was to deliver a series of very short pulses (200 pulses at 11 nanoseconds long, for example). Appropriate degradation was achieved by a total reception of about 26 J/cm2, which requires an intensity of about 10MW per pulse. Even so, some aspects of the colour and penetration of the Shroud image were not duplicated, and require further experimentation.1) Di Lazzaro’s experiments never extended to more than few square centimetres, and no attempt was made to reproduce any aspect of the image per se. To do so would either take a very long time or a great many more lasers, or a process unknown to science, or a process unknowable to science – a miracle. Scientists do not engage in the last, and the second last is very much a fringe pursuit.2) The image on the Shroud is that of a man in repose. To what extent it reflects the process of Resurrection is beyond any current knowledge, either scientific or theological.3) If it were ever established that the linen of the Shroud within the boundary of a bloodstain, was degraded in the same way as the image outside the bloodstain, there would be a strong presumption that the blood was added after the image and the Shroud was the product of artifice. This has not been established. However the evidence that the blood was added before the image is not particularly strong either. Nor has di Lazzaro or any other of the radiation hypothesists carried out experiments on blood to determine its effect. One might surmise that a series of powerful laser pulses sufficient to ‘scorch’ cloth would create an observable alteration to a bloodstain.4) All these experiments could be carried out within a graduate or postgraduate study programme without incurring any extra expense.","date":"August 13, 2015 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/11/tantalizingly-close-enough/","cat":"article","title":"Tantalizingly Close Enough?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"In a word, no he didn’t.

Although they list no less than 6 references for this, every one is directly derived from the biblical accounts of the resurrection, which, even if literally true, do not give any date at all!For another example they say that ” [Most writers] accept the occurrence of the Resurrection earthquake, to which they assign the severity of a catastrophic event, characterised by a local magnitude ML = 8.2.” However they only give one reference for this, At enormous expense, I can quote some exact words of the reference: “The fact that these earthquakes in Jerusalem are not mentioned by contemporary pagan writers, or by three out of the four evangelists, suggests that they may have been inspired by the topos of natures reflecting events of great importance, and they must not be considered as referring to historical earthquakes.” Ambaseys (the author of the reference) goes on to suggests that if the fissures in the vicinity of the Holy Sepulchre are due to an earthquake (which they show is probably not the case), “the causative earthquake should have been strong enough to destroy Jerusalem, for which there is no evidence.” Ambaseys is generous enough to mention, albeit with a wink of incredulity, three modern writers who disagree with him, as they believe in the earthquake, “to which they assign a magnitude of a catastrophic event of ML (sic) = 8.2.”There is more, and in detail, but surely we have enough here to begin to show that Carpinteri’s paper is far too speculative to be accepted without a great deal more research on his part.","date":"February 16, 2014 at 6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/16/the-shroud-of-turin-story-brings-up-all-the-usual-issues-about-click-bait-journalism/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Shroud of Turin story brings up all the usual issues about click-bait journalism"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Oh, yes, time moved on and I forgot your earlier post.

There is no doubt that Rogers’s much later surface contamination hypothesis is distinctly at variance with earlier findings, and leads to contradictory conclusions in some cases, that the blood spectra are far from definitive and that the whole cotton business is a muddle, but that’s all part of the fun.And as for the pollen….Obloquy… good word, isn’t it!","date":"February 17, 2014 at 11:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/16/the-shroud-of-turin-story-brings-up-all-the-usual-issues-about-click-bait-journalism/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Shroud of Turin story brings up all the usual issues about click-bait journalism"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Having said that, I think it is important that these rather esoteric ideas get their proper airing.

Experts! But actually I don’t refer to a ‘scientific community,’ because I don’t think there is one. I sometimes refer to ‘scientific consensus,’ but even there we must be careful. “Most scientists think…..” is often a very subjective judgement based on ones own research partners and a quick flick through Google. This is where a forum like this is so important. A senior academic and Editor-in-Chief of a respected journal might well be regarded as an expert, while a middle school science teacher might not. However, if the science teacher can demonstrate the invalidity of the academic’s work, then the tables turn.Real experts, in this context, are essentially compendia of experiences and resources, which they can use to demonstrate the value of their opinion. If they don’t do that, but rely on their authority alone, then their opinion is no more valid than anybody else’s.You’re right that “properly assessed” was rather an imprecise term. “Universally assessed” might have been better. Some will go for the “he’s a famous scientist so he must be right” angle, some for the “he disagrees with me so he must be wrong” angle (both held by several commenters here), and a few who will look more carefully at the data and references.

I’m sorry I’m not Dr Phillips, but I guess I can answer your question as well as any. By the “back” side, do you mean the side that wasn’t touching the body? Or the side that was touching the body, but lay underneath it so that the image of the back appeared on it?A quick Google search will give you the images of both halves of the cloth, with the front (face and arms) and the back (buttocks and footprints) sides. To find a picture of the outside of the cloth, which bears no image and less blood, try http://shroud.wikispaces.com/PROPERTIES.This side, without the images, has very rarely been seen, so it is difficult to discuss. Since 1534 it has been hidden by backing cloths, and was only exposed briefly in 2002 when they were changed. Even so, some people have tried to analyse the photos that were taken and think they see a faint image of at least the face. More controversially, some people think the two images of the face (on opposite sides of the same area of cloth) show two slightly different positions of the features. It might be supposed that the half of this cloth that was in contact with the surface of the tomb would have stains or stone dust from the tomb on it, but this has not been confirmed.As for the folding, if it covered a body, the sheet was folded over the head, which is why the two images of the heads are close together. It looks as if the body was laid on the cloth with a short distance over at the foot end, which was folded up over the toes, and a body’s length at the head end, which was draped back over the head and laid against the insteps, possibly even overlapping the bottom bit of cloth by an inch or two.I assure you that although the face and front half of the image is most discussed, the rest of the Shroud has been far from neglected!","date":"April 20, 2014 at 1:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/20/wayne-phillips-hopes-to-create-a-small-shroud-army/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Wayne Phillips:  Hopes to create a small “Shroud Army”"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes.

The body is laid on it.Second (and I may get the order wrong here), flowers and spices are piled alongside the body, various bits of wood and other material were placed on top, and then the body was tightly wrapped (Or was the body wrapped first and the other stuff placed around it afterwards?). A cloth ‘cap’ was added last, after the wrapping, to keep the shroud close around the head.I’m confused here. Were there two pieces of cloth – first the shroud (lengthways) and then a long thin bandage wrapped around the shroud transversely to keep it tight? Where do the artifacts fit in?Third, this arrangement was left, with one or more incense/charcoal burners. The heat evaporated the moisture on the cloth, drawing the dissolved solids outwards, so that any image formed was only on the outer surfaces of the threads.Fourth, as the cloth dried out, it also shrank, until it was as tight as it could be around the body, touching only the ‘hills’ of the contours of the body and not the ‘valleys.” Presumably, as it shrank, it stretched the ‘bandage’ wrapped widthways across the body to keep it well wrapped.

Selecting, specifically, Turkish and Palestinian plants, and most of those with conspicuous flowers and entomophilous pollen, and finding his Shroud pollen matched one, he assumed that it would not match anything else, and identified it as that species. He had a pollen that looked like Gundelia, therefore it was Gundelia. The fact that it also looked very much like any other species of thistle was overlooked.Nonetheless, I feel I cannot dismiss Frei’s findings altogether.

Or maybe it happened more slowly. Or maybe each cubic nanometre of body changed into a cubic nanometre of air (and vice versa) so that there was no pressure decrease and no bang, and the mass change of the universe was slightly less.

Here are some of them:Verginio Timossi: 23 mg/cm2. This was based on a copy of the shroud, not the real thing.Gilbert Raes: 25 mg/cm2. This was based on careful measurement of his tiny extracted fragment, and extrapolated.R. A. Morris: 25 mg/cm2. This was estimated from Compton scatter, again not by actually weighing the shroud, and gave a combined shroud/backing density of 30-40mg/cm2. Dividing this proportionately between the measured thickness for the backing and shroud (270/345) gave about 20mg/cm2 for the shroud and 15mg/cm2 for the backing, although Schwalbe & Rogers considered the shroud value too low, considering “the comparatively open weave structure of the backing cloth.”Giulio Riggi: 20+/-3 mg/cm2. I don’t know where this comes from.Timothy Jull: 22mg/cm2. From direct measurements of the C14 fragment retained by Tucson.Broadly, let’s agree on 25mg/cm2, and a surface area of 440cm x 110cm. That’s about 1.2kg.I myself have a largish, thickish piece of linen of area 45000 cm2 and weight 880g, giving an areal density of 19.6g/cm2. The Shroud, as I have said before, is a thick sturdy piece of cloth, not a delicate fabric. I do not believe it was made threadbare by handling.Another way of thinking about it is in grams per square metre. At 25mg/cm2, that’s 250g/m2. This is towards the heavier end of the sailcloth market, suitable for sails of more than 40 square metres. (H.G. Hasler, J.K.

I am told that the book features new information from the Savoy family archives, which will be extremely interesting, but I should like to know how accurate they are, and when any particular piece of information was written. I hope Evaristo gives us more than an abstract of his findings. Family tradition is a wonderful thing and leads researchers to particular avenues of exploration which otherwise might not have occurred, but it is not adequate as data. The biggest alteration to the Shroud – the side strip removal and reattachment, or at any rate the insertion of the side-seam – was apparently not documented at all, as all we have here is vague speculation. (I accept though that it was done before the Shroud became a possession of the House of Savoy)Let’s look at a couple of passages: repairwork was carried out “but obviously with similar, yet newer, materials containing dyes and other medieval manufacturing ingredients, in an attempt to better blend the new sections in, as best possible, with the original fabric.” An attempt to blend in? Does that sound invisible to you? Not to me.And what does this mean: “Unlike the meticulous repair work that had been carried out in previous centuries by religious expert weavers following the damage caused to the Shroud by fires and which left little trace of the removed sections…” It seems to imply that the repairwork carried out to the Shroud after fires (plural?) was meticulous. I’d like more information about that, as the repairwork after the 1532 fire was downright shoddy.And what of: “the different types of linen, dyes, resins and fabric patches, discovered to have been present on the outermost edges of the sheet.” Really? Discovered by whom?There is evidence of missing threads all over the Shroud, including over the image, using Shroud 2.0. There is a little evidence of mending, but it is far from invisible. My own view is that repairs to the shroud apart from the patches were little more than trimming the edges and sewing them up more strongly. I still do not believe in the reweaving idea.

We foggy Englishmen often use the term “for hours” as an idiomatic term meaning “for longer than it takes to get bored” rather than a specific length of time, as I was here. But you’re correct in that it could be an interesting experiment. I also agree, after reading Architecture for the Shroud, that it was unlikely that anybody stood at a balcony holding onto the exposed shroud for more than an hour, at the most. There were processions back and forth, and at least in some cases the Shroud was exhibited on all sides of the public platform, with a covering cloth raised and lowered three times (calling to mind the triple ostentation of the monstrance at the Service of Benediction). The external expositions were active rather than static. For lengthy devotions, the shroud was placed on some kind of reliquary inside the cathedral.I’m not persuade by considerations of wind, I have to say. I can’t see a holy relic being allowed to flap around like a sheet on a clothes line, let alone the voluminous vestments, tall hats and water soluble decorations. Nor do I think UV degradation over such a short time would be significant.

First, let’s clear the date thing up. Of the 12 BP dates quoted by the Nature paper, the earliest is one of Oxford’s (795BP) and the latest one of Arizona’s (591BP). When calibrated, the Oxford one corresponds to about 1250, and the Arizona one corresponds to about either about 1325, or about 1400, but not the dates in between. This is because of the way the calibration graph zigzags at around that time. In fact, of the 12 BP dates, eight correspond entirely to the period between 1250 and 1335, while four correspond to three dates, one between 1250 and 1335, one between 1335 and 1385, and one between 1385 and 1410, but not any intervening dates. It makes better sense to reject these later dates, and to consider the Shroud as having been dated between 1250 and 1325, a 75 year variation rather than your 170 years or so.Interestingly, a similar operation applied to the 13 dates of the St Louis Cope, which is almost exactly contemporaneous with the Shroud, results in a likelihood of a date between 1220 and 1320, which is a larger spread. Even so, the point Max is making is valid, the discrepancy between the three average dates of the Shroud being about 20 years, while that of the St Louis cope is about 3 years.Riani and Atkinson attempted to explore in some detail whether discrepancies between the 12 individual dates would enable them to reconstruct the positions of those sub-samples within the strip cut from the shroud, but this wasn’t possible. However the three average dates were statistically different. The Oxford sample dates to about 1260, and the Arizona sample to about 1300, a difference of 40 years. (Compare this to equivalent figures of about 1265 and 1270 for the St Louis Cope, and we can see why the Shroud discrepancy is significant).Be that as it may, Max wants to know how much contamination I suggest would make a 13th century cloth appear older than it really is, in a graduated fashion across four centimetres. The answer is that if from 0% to about 15% of the mass of the sample across its length was 17th century alizarin (madder)  combined with the linen, a sufficient discrepancy could be achieved. Sadly I cannot discover by how much the mass of a cloth is increased by dying it. 15% seems to me rather a lot.","date":"May 24, 2014 at 12:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"On the contrary, Max, I do have the foggiest notion, but I have to agree I was surprised by the calculation. However, much depends on the original date of the cloth. For other reasons I have been recently inclining towards the mid-13th century, when the C14 calibration graph has a single gradient and the addition of small amounts of dye would make little difference to the calculated date. However, if the original date of the cloth were later, say 1290 or so (as originally suggested by the Nature paper), then the calibration graph zigzags up and down, and tiny variations of C14 make large calendar differences. A BP date of 670, for example corresponds to a calendar date of 1290, while a BP date of 660 can correspond to a calendar date of 1375.

Just a guess, based on shroud.com’s History. There are listed about 60 showings, public and private, and the information that for some time the shroud was exhibited annually on 4th May for about 30 years in the 15th century. My 60 – 70 was clearly an underestimate, and perhaps your 100 – 150 was more accurate. Now we’re creeping up to 200 – 300. I think you may be pushing it there.2) I’m not sure what you’re getting at here. There is no evidence about the bleaching of either cloth. The Holland cloth has definitely darkened in some places, which may be due to light, or general grime, or deliberate dying. If the Shroud was bleached then it should be darkening too, as some conservators have feared. If not, then it should be lightening, which I have not heard claimed.3) I’m not at all in denial of the Savoy royal family tradition. But as far as I know it’s just a tradition, and not substantiated. There is nothing to oppose.4) I still don’t know what you mean by 70% reliable. If you mean that 70% of all radiocarbon datings pin the artifact down to a single year, then you are being hopelessly generous; if you mean that 30% of all radiocarbon datings are wrong even within their errors bars and after calibration then you are being absurdly mean. Perhaps you mean something, but I’ve no idea what!I must repeat, Max, that scientists don’t do facts in the same way you do. To us, a fact is not the same as a conviction, however deeply held; it is an irrefutable conclusion (although there are variations on exactly what irrefutable might mean). I have not reached an irrefutable conclusion about many things to do with the shroud (the chemical basis of the colours of the quad mosaics being a notable exception), and such inclinations as I have are usually easily refutable; the trouble is however, they mostly haven’t been. Simply declaring that I’m wrong, of course, is not a refutation but a denial.","date":"May 26, 2014 at 1:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well, sort of. In an earlier post I wrote: Fanti’s book and the brou-ha-ha that came with it involved various more or less dubious means of dating old flax, including the highly controversial mechanical testing. After a while he published a paper in Vibrational Spectroscopy, in which all mention of the shroud and all his mechanical dating methods were omitted, leaving only FTIR spectroscopy. He subjected 12 samples of known age from 3000BC to the present to his process, and observed a noticeable progressive change in the spectra recorded. Flax, it appears, can be shown to degrade with age. In ideal situations (permanent storage in a single place of constant environmental conditions) his findings suggest an ascertainable age band of 400 years, which might be narrowed if further ressearch was carried out. Although this method is unlikely ever to be better than C14 dating, it has the merit of being wholly non-destructive. In more variable conditions however (and the Shroud springs inevitably to mind) this does not seem a promising line of research.He has since returned to the mechanical testing, publishing first a device for carrying it out, and now “Multi-parametric micro-mechanical dating of single fibers coming from ancient flax textiles,” in which, again, 11 samples of known date were subjected to 5 mechanical tests, and  again, he found a correlation between his results and their ages with a “relative standard uncertainty of the method” of about 200 years. He does not include any Shroud fibres in this study. I believe that the criteria and criticisms which applied to the earlier paper still apply. His fibres from the Shroud were, by definition, loose, having either detatched during the course of its history or by being sucked out by the vacuum collector. They can validly be described as not typical of the fibres still part of intact threads, and as having been likely to have suffered more mechanical damage than the rest of the shroud. However there is no way of knowing how consistent their mechanical deterioration has been. It is overwhelmingly more likely that they ‘date’ by the mechanical deterioration method to a time considerably earlier than that of the manufacture of the shroud.All this may be explained in his new book, but having bought and read his previous one without being informed of much more than the publisher’s blurb told us, I am reluctant to buy the new one until somebody else reviews it!

About half the pollen on the tunic comes from Stinging Nettles and Syrian Mesquite. Both these plants are insect pollinated, and their pollen does not float about in the air.

Does anybody have any reason why one is better than the other. Google has a tendency simply to ignore negatives, I find, which can completely alter the sense of a passage, which Bing comes up with weird and whimsical idiomatic translations of passages which don’t require it.Anyway, here goes:After a quick summary of what the book is and its reception, Gian Marco says..“In fabric over time the cellulose in the fibers is altered and degrades. The more time that passes, the greater the alteration. By measuring, in a fabric of unknown age, some parameter that is related to the degree of alteration, and comparing it with the values of the same parameter in ancient fabrics of known ages, the age of the unknown tissue can, in principle, be estimated. This would work if it were not that alterations may proceed at different speeds depending on several factors. In short, the degradation of cellulose is not a clock that always ticks at the same rate (as it is does with the decay of radiocarbon). To take a trivial example, if I meet someone and observe her dress, I can try to figure out if the dress is new or old, looking more or less if it is worn, torn, faded or crumpled. But I can not correctly estimate the age if I do not take into account various other factors such as the quality of the fabric, the conditions in which it was stored and how and how much was used.The new results.Fanti has obtained some antique fabrics from different eras of approximately known date. He conducted three sets of measurements using three different methods. In the first and second series he measured certain alterations of cellulose using spectroscopic methods – Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. For spectroscopic analyses Fanti turned to two more professors, Anna Tinti of Bologna and Pietro Baraldi of Modena. In the third series he measured a set of mechanical parameters, for example the behavior of fibers under tension and the breaking load (with the assistance of a doctoral student, Pierandrea Malfi).In each series, from measurements on samples of known age, Fanti has constructed a calibration curve, which represents how the trend varies with age. Then he measured the same parameters on the Shroud and derived an estimate of its age by making a comparison with the calibration curve.Fanti says that he has not found in the literature similar calibration curves for these three methods, and supposes that they have been introduced by him for the first time.There were nine ancient fabrics used in compiling the calibration curves, with ages from 3000 BC to 1000 AD. Five were from Egypt, three from Israel and one from Peru. He also used two modern fabrics of recent manufacture.The confidence intervals at 95% for the origin of the fabric of the shroud with the three methods were respectively: 300 BC ± 400 and 200 BC ± 500, 400 AD ± 400. Averaging these values, Fanti arrived at a final result to 33 BC ± 250 and is satisfied that this interval includes the time of Christ.We see that the three results cover a very wide range, from 300 BC to 400 AD. Considering the bounds of the intervals of confidence, the dates extend further, from 700 BC to 800 AD.The dispersion would be even greater if Fanti had used his original result for the first series, which was 752 BC ± 400. However here Fanti has made a correction, trying to take into account the effects of the fire of 1532 in which the Shroud was involved, and moved the date from 752 BC to 300 BC. This is based on measurements made on a recent piece of fabric which has been subjected to heating. This correction is somewhat arbitrary. On the one hand it is not known at what temperature and for how long the cloth of the Shroud has been heated by the fire. On the other hand the effects on a new fabric manufactured using modern technology may be different from the effects on the Shroud, also taking into account that the damage triggered by the fire may have worsened over the centuries.It should be noted that, as he made a correction for the first method, Fanti should also have made a correction for the third method, as results from similar heating tests of modern materials produced an apparent aging “of a few centuries” using this method. However it seems that Fanti decided to rejuvenate the result of the first series, whose original results came out too old, but preferred not to do the same to the third series, whose original results came out too young.All tests were conducted on individual fibers of flax. These are the ‘elementary’ fibers which make up the threads. The fibers are thin and have a diameter of about 10 or 20 micrometers (thousandths of a millimeter). Thread is manufactured by the twisting together of fibers in the spinning process. Any section of thread may contain a hundred or so fibres.There is no guarantee that the methods are reliableThe factors that affect the apparent aging of a fabric are variable in nature. We can cite the light, the conditions of temperature and humidity, the presence of dust, exposure to various chemical agents, and mechanical stresses. Also factors that seem insignificant can accumulate a significant effect if continuing for centuries. For example, a linen fabric which is folded can produce damage to the fibers in the bends (which is why today  the Shroud is kept fully extended to prevent further damage). In general, the processes of degradation can be very slow and are not easily simulated with laboratory experiments.Hypothetically, you can imagine some differences in the conditions of preservation of the Shroud compared to other fabrics. The weather conditions, temperature and humidity, were different in Europe from in Egypt or Israel. In particular, moisture is harmful to fabrics and the Egyptian climate is probably drier than the French or Piedmontese. The methods of processing flax in Europe in the 14th century may have been different from those of ancient Egypt, such as the bleaching process. The comparison fabrics probably rested for centuries in a tomb and then remained in the warehouses of a museum, while the Shroud has had a much more lively history, especially in the early days. It was transported here and there, both before and after the transition to the Savoy. It was folded and unfolded, and later rolled up on a tight cylinder and unrolled. It was involved in a fire. It was mended. It was exposed to light outdoors, and to the fumes of incense or candles or torches. Perhaps it was brushed to clean it.Also there may have been unknown episodes in the history of the Shroud, especially in the period before 1500, which have had a measurable effect today.Fanti says he has conducted tests to assess the “systematic effects” of various factors, but in practice he has only made the correction that we saw for the first series.These uncertainties mean that the methods used by Fanti are inherently unreliable because it can not be excluded that there were influences of factors known or unknown, with effects difficult to assess. So, if his methods result in a date that differs from that obtained in other ways, it is necessary to doubt the result. We have two reasons to think that the fabric of the Shroud was manufactured around 1300, the radiocarbon dating and the historical fact of its first appearance. On the other hand, we have no reason to suggest that the Shroud is from the first century. The only “evidence” of antiquity adduced by Shroudologists is in the (non-existent) fingerprints of two coins of Pontius Pilate!However, there is a more concrete reason to think that the fibers of the Shroud used by Fanti were unsuitable for testing.In two television interviews, Fanti was shown withdrawing a fiber from a piece of fabric. He separated out a thread and pulled out a fiber with tweezers. But this is not the way in which he got the fibers of the Shroud. He did not have a piece of fabric, or even pieces of intact thread. He used a dust collection made by Giovanni Riggi di Numana in 1978.It should be noted that from 1534 to 2002 the cloth of the Shroud was continuously fastened with stitching to another linen cloth for support. In 1978 Riggi unstitched some sections on the edges and stuck in the cavity a vacuum cleaner with which he collected dust in cotton filters interposed along the tube outlet. Years later, some of these filters were made available to Fanti. From these filters, in particular the one designated as “h”, Fanti took the material for his analysis.Together with dust of various kinds were also fragments of fibers of the shroud, in addition to flax fibers of the support fabric, cotton fibers from the filters and possibly other fibers of uncertain origin.We can assume that any fibers of the Shroud collected from the vacuum extractor had deteriorated more than the fibers still enclosed in the threads. Fibers have, in the course of time, detached from the back of the Shroud and become trapped inside the cavity between the cloths, but those that have would be either weaker or more damaged than those which remained in the threads. For example they could be fibers that originally came from areas of stitching or burning or soaking in water or any other places that had suffered damage for some reason.In addition to the fibers that had already become detached in the past, Riggi’s vacuum cleaner could have detached others while it was working, and those fibres, too, would be weaker or more damaged than those which remained. Fanti’s material is thus shown to be unrepresentative in being particularly deteriorated, so it is no wonder that the age he calculated is more apparent than real.In a 2008 article Fanti showed photographs of many fibers collected by filters of which he had already come into possession, including those from filter “h”. We saw that the fibers were very short, averaging about a millimeter. Usually linen fibers are somewhat longer. So those used by Fanti were small fragments derived from the breakage of fibers which were already integrally fragile. In his book Fanti does not say how long the fibers from his comparison tissues were, but he may provide more detail in a future publication.After they were collected in 1978, the fibers remained on the filters for several years, together with the rest of the dust and dirt sucked in. The individual fibers were exposed to dust on all sides.Earlier than 2008, fibers were collected from Fanti’s filters using adhesive tape. Photographs were obtained showing the fibers on the tape. Fanti does not say if these fibres were used for his present experiments, but if they were they had remained in contact with the glue for a time of perhaps several years and then a solvent may have been used to remove them from it. We hope to find more information on these procedures when Fanti’s next article appears.However they were obtained, Fanti then observed them at length under a microscope. The aim was to separate the flax fibers from the Shroud from those coming from the cloth support or from those of cotton or other origin. Looking into the microscope, Fanti says, he was able to distinguish the fibers of the Shroud not only from those of other material, but also from the linen fibers of the fabric support. For observation under the microscope, the fiber must be illuminated and, if it is not on a tape, somehow manipulated.In short, the Shroud material used for the experiments was not the most fortunate. In his book Fanti makes no secret that the fibers of the Shroud which he used come from Riggi’s filters but does not comment on the risks implicit in the fact that these fibers have had a more complicated history than those freshly extracted from other fabrics containing intact threads. We can only note Fanti’s own words concerning the third method, the mechanical one, with reference to his experiments on the comparison fibres. (p. 85):    “In some cases, in fact, fibers taken from particular parts of a thread which had been more exposed to the environment and mechanical actions such as rubbing, showed a structural weakening, due to probable microcracks, which sometimes lead the mechanical method to result in dates with amplitude shifts of up to a thousand years.” Such is the true accuracy of this method. Two fibers taken from the same thread can produce dating with a difference of a thousand years. Fanti continues:    “To avoid incurring similar problems of measurement, the fibers used to perform the mechanical tests – and thus the determination of the curves of dating – were taken from their fabric in a similar way to those used to pick up the fibers from the Shroud.”I do not know if Fanti means that he extracted fibers from his comparison fabrics with a vacuum cleaner, at least for the third series, but in any case he could not select the fibers that had separated in time from the points of greatest wear and tear that had built up for centuries.…For my part, I think that there is no reason to doubt that the material used by Fanti really comes from the filters of the vacuum cleaner used by Riggi in 1978. It is known that Riggi kept the filters and later on several occasions had bestowed portions of the material to others. Today Riggi is gone, but I do not think that Fanti has made false declarations about the origin of the fibers examined by him.I would also add that I can not know if Fanti has correctly identified the fibers of the Shroud, distinguishing them from other fibers collected from the extractor, such as those of cloth or filter support, but that would be material of a more recent age than the Shroud itself and not could provide a dating at the time of Christ. In short, I believe that the results are unreliable, not for any doubts about the origin of the material, but for the inadequacy of the methods used.”","date":"April 4, 2013 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/sales-and-amazon-reviews-of-fantis-new-book/","cat":"books","title":"Sales and Amazon Reviews of Fanti’s New Book"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"That’s generous; thank you.

The article, after all, includes successive phrases such as “the evidence strongly suggests” and “there is ample evidence,” which give a wholly unjustified weight to what is presented in the book. There is, I think, an interesting linguistic correspondence between Abraham and Brahma, Sara and Saraswati, and for that matter Krishna and Christ. I also think that’s all it is, an interesting correspondence. I agree that there is a small group of people who maintain that some sites in India also have New Testament correspondence. To claim that this, or any of the other evidence attested, “strongly suggests” anything, or is “ample evidence” is simply untrue.I note that the whole tenor of Tom Devins’ comment above is much less assertive. “I don’t know” and “Maybe, just maybe” and “Who will ever know?” I don’t think this is ‘goof-ball’ and agree that “reasonable questions suggesting other possibilities” are at least worth some consideration. I hope that the book ‘Jesus lived in India’ is as humble in its presentation as Tom’s posting.Elsewhere on this blog however I notice that Tom asserts that “The Catholic Church… through Fr Francis Tiso’s on-site investigation… has confirmed the most recent incident…” of a “rainbow body” dematerialisation. This is entirely untrue. Fr Tiso’s own investigation was dignified and spiritual but not at all scientific and anyway did not come to any definite conclusions other than to assert that the rainbow body phenomenon is quite different from resurrection.

His method was to take known samples of different ages and correlate them to changes in their spectra and mechanical properties. If a reasonable correlation were found, then it would be possible to date material of unknown provenance by these methods. Unfortunately, Fanti has not published his findings in detail, and what has been published shows such poor correlation that his work has not been taken up by archaeological science as useful. So many other factors than age can contribute to the deterioration of archaeological materials that it seems unlikely that any measurement of such deterioration can be a reliable method of dating it.I have not had an opportunity to study Fanti’s numismatic findings, so cannot comment on them, but I’m afraid I’m unlikely to shell out $60 or $70 for the opportunity.","date":"June 28, 2015 at 7:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/28/update-on-new-book-by-giulio-fanti-and-pierandrea-malfi/","cat":"books","title":"Update on New Book by Giulio Fanti and Pierandrea Malfi"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Selvedges, eh?Take a piece of woven cloth. The two ends have been cut off a larger roll, and if not finished off in some way, the weft threads will slide off the ends of the warp threads and the edges will become tatty. This finishing off, I will call a HEM. The two sides of the cloth are held together by the weft threads themselves, and do not need any finishing off to keep the cloth intact. These two sides are the SELVEDGES. They do not require stitching at all.The shroud of Turin has its famous sidestrip, which may or may not be separate from the main cloth. It appears that at the Raes sample end, it was separate, as Raes took his sample to pieces, but such is the continuity of the weft threads across the supposed seam that there is some doubt as to whether the stitching along it actually joins two pieces of cloth together or not. I will refer to this as a TUCK. The idea that a much wider piece of cloth had a strip taken out of it, and the two sides sewn back together has little to recommend it, in my view.A quick look at the Durante photo on shroudscope shows that the shroud is actually hemmed (the side folded over and sewn down) all around the perimeter, including the exposed edges of the cut away corners. How old this continuous hem is, and what stitches were used in its creation, I’ve no idea. However as a consequence no selvedges are now visible at all.So what and where is the mysterious stitching that may or may not resemble something from Masada? Presumably we are talking about the stitching of the TUCK, which almost certainly has nothing to do with SELVEDGES. So what was the stitch across the tuck? Alan Whanger describes it as a “wide relaxed running stitch, as S-shaped stitch.” His description does not sound terribly complicated.

While it is perfectly possible to draw all sorts of interesting comparisons between a couple of images – and I treasure your comments regarding “The Shroud of Turin Blimp” more than I can say – it is also possible that none of these was intended or noticed by the people who made the images, and have only been recognised by people whose profession is to do just that.Now I’m bothered by how you might be able to persuade us doubters that your parallels between the Pray manuscript and the Shroud are deliberate, as it seems hardly fair just to say ‘I don’t believe you’ without suggesting how you might go about changing our minds. Being supported by other experts in iconocryptanalysis would be a start, as David Goulet has suggested, or demonstrating more unequivocal comparisons. To me, the blood smudge is trivial, but the diagonal line of crosses and the L&P holes, although I do not agree that they are connected with the Shroud, are clearly deliberate, and not easy to explain. A picture of Christ being flogged leaving cruciform welts would be good, and your ‘palmette’ illustrations are a good start, but they don’t convince me. Similarly, some kind of artistic tradition showing a rigid rectangular shroud in a Three Marys painting, or a herringbone design being represented as stepped pyramids rather than stacked zig-zags would also be effective. Otherwise, merely inventing long words, entertaining though they be, doesn’t do it for me.

The Annual General Meetings of the International Society of Cryptostenographologists must be a riot.“So what do you make of the loros as Byzantine imperial insigne symbolic of Christ’s Shroud?” Not nothing at all. It seems that this was a pre-Christian tradition overlaid by Christian symbolism, rather like Saturnalia turning into Christmas. Actual loroi, as you have mentioned, seem to have been richly decorated with jewels and bore no relation to the real thing. The Grandson antependium is indeed somewhat different, in that it is more simple, but there is nothing to suggest that the herringbone needlework is intended to represent the herringbone of the Shroud, particularly as the insense burners are filled in in exactly the same style. I do agree that if the Shroud were ever convincingly shown to be ancient, then the herringbone loroi might constitute a contributory corollary, but I do not think that they can be assumed to be derivative until that occurs.“How can you explain this striking departure from the traditional Byzantine depiction of the lavishly adorned ceremonial long and narrow stole.” The relatively late date and the Western artistic tradition are adequate in themselves as explanations without needing any knowledge of the Shroud by the embroiderers.“I have produced a comparative iconography of the lower portion of the TS face ‘tailed-epsilon’ shaped blood trickle dripping onto the eyebrow ridge in BOTH the HP Ms Christ’s and the TS man’s forehead. The HP Ms Christ’s is REMARKABLY SHROUD-LIKE while the TS man’s is REMARKABLY HP MANUSCRIPT-LIKE!” I have studied your article carefully. The two alleged blood smears are not remarkably similar at all to me, and I think it is special pleading to suggest that the Pray artist only used the bottom third of the epsilon stain, which he then smudged downwards to represent the pendant tear-drop.“I never said ‘the nose on the Shroud (was) sufficiently crooked for anyone to have depicted it on a painting or a coin’.” Well forgive me; I must have misinterpreted this section, as it appeared to me that you only mentioned the skewed nose in connection with “Fanti’s solidus” to which you provided a link, and you now say “This is totally consistent with one (Edessenian-Byzantine?) engraver incorporating Christ’s skewed nose in his engraving of the Pantocrator’s face.” So did they or didn’t they?“When it comes to your opinion on the three issues, bad will and bad faith are sheer euphemisms!” That’s just rude, and also untrue. (Unconnected speculation – is it only authenticists who find it difficult to face contradiction without abusing their antagonists? Can anybody quote an example of an abusive non-authenticist?)““The coins of Justinian II’s first reign (685 – 695 AD) are indeed remarkably shroud-like, and it is difficult not to think it was indeed the model.” I did write that, and it’s surely true. It doesn’t mean that the Shroud was the model for the coins, but it is certainly interesting. I’ve no doubt that a Byzantine art historian would attribute it – and perhaps by association the Shroud of the 14th centrury – to the influence of a Roman or Greek image of ‘the wise old man’ being brought from Rome to Constantinople, but I wouldn’t know the truth of the matter.“In all likelihood and obedience to a specific iconological canon, the TS man’s forehead clot DISlocation in centre hairline of the forehead and stylization as a double stranded quiff of dropping hair, was deemed more suitable both within the general economy of the Justinian II’s Solidus obverse Christ face and… the engraver’s eye.” Not in all likelihood as far as I’m concerned. In all likelihood there is no conection whatever between the double stranded quiff and the epsilon.“NumidsBids, ancientcoins.com, lot numbers: 1729; 578; 579 and 580.” Alas I can only find the last two of these, as you forgot to provide the auction details.

On the contrary, it helps to explain some of the real objections that were raised when it was first proposed (impossible in practice, no fluorescence), thus strengthening the argument rather than weakening it. Remarkably, while some authenticists have deemed it wholly impossible for anyone to have heated up a bas relief to scorching point and applied a cloth to it so quickly that only the surface fibres were scorched, they find it quite possible for a dead body to glow like a child’s Electrostorm corona discharge sphere, to explode in a cloud of subatomic particles, or to radiate barely detectable heat in perfectly vertical rays.Both Walter McCrone and Ray Rogers came to the conclusion that the Shroud was covered in something that formed the image such that, were it removed, no image at all would be visible.

It fairly quotes a couple of medievalist art historians, which is unusually generous, but has little revolutionary to offer until the end, when we learn what exactly Prof. Fanti has discovered. Firstly, by mechanical stress experiments, that there is a 95% probability that the Shroud is from 400AD. Blithely ignoring the fact that this means that its chance of being first century is vanishingly small, the programme goes on to say that by reflectance spectroscopy, the Shroud is from 200-300BC, and that the average of three findings (the third is not described) is 33BC. I wonder what the confidence level of that is.The last part of the programme covers Fanti’s coronal discharge experiments, and, if this isn’t a reconstruction like every other fragment of the programme, we see a brief glimpse of a Shroud-like figure apparently produced by draping a mannequin with a cloth and subjecting it to an enormous charge for hours. This is the first I’ve heard of this, and I’ve no faith at all in the ridiculuous re-enactment and breathless commentary:“This time, Fanti turns up the power to nearly one hundred per cent…” Wow! Sounds impressive. But 100% of what, exactly? And why does the dial we see being turned to 100 actually go up to 120? Does Fanti’s machine actually deliver more than all of something?“… and he bombards the cloth with electricity for more than 24 hours.” And an image forms, which we glimpse a very little of, but which includes skeletonic hands with brightly coloured knuckles. Significantly, although the camera pans towards it, we do not see the face.Fanti himself says: “it is necessary to calibrate very well the energy. Only the range 97-98 it is possible to obtain an image. The corona discharge gives us the most number of compatibility between the experiental results and what we see on the Shroud.” This statement, and the image he actually produced, needs to be displayed and explained in a great deal more detail to be at all convincing. It is a pity that such a significant development in Shroud studies, if so it be, has been introduced in such a brief cryptic manner at the very end of this programme.

Cennini’s description of “The Way to Work on Linen or Hempen Cloth” is at Chapter 162 et seq. It is not easy to follow, but is clearly designed not to be “rather brittle and susceptible to cracking, thus making it suitable for rigid surfaces only.” The expression “half-chalk ground” an the emulsion of gesso and linseed oil, described by Gottsegen, is not from Cennini.There is a good paper on medieval flags at http://destrier.net/astonhall/article_medieval_painted_flags.20070501.pdf, by Rebecca Robynson. She points to another Chapter in Cennini, “Various Ways to do Hangings”, which I have not identified in the archive.org editions, where Cennini recommends omitting gesso altogether. Giorgio Vasari, a century later, says Robynson, also “states that if the canvases are not intended to be stationary, gesso is not to be used because it ‘would interfere with their flexibility, seeing that the gesso would crack if they were rolled up.’ He instead recommends the canvas be primed with a mixture of white lead, walnut oil, and flour after several coats of size.”In other books on medieval gesso, it is said that while Italian artists used calcium sulphate, northern European painters used calcium carbonate, which Freeman also refers to.Having sorted that out, Russ still makes a valid point!It is true that while there is plenty of evidence for calcium carbonate, there is, according to STuRP, none for the protein binder which should have accompanied it.

Cloth which had been subjected to extremes of temperature, humidity or stress such as rolling or unrolling, would be expected to have degraded more than cloth kept in a more constant environment, and even if a fair sample of cloths of different ages were compared, their fibres would still have variable degradation, so it would be necessary to obtain them in a similar fashion. Fibres extracted from intact threads would have suffered less degradation than fibres extracted by sticky tape or vacuuming, or fibres which had become separated from the cloth completely by continual abrasion. Compared to all Fanti’s control samples, the fibres he examined from the Shroud had suffered in all the ways mentioned above, and would be expected to give a much older result than they really should if the measurements were properly calibrated. Nowhere in his book does Fanti explain his methods for this calibration (or give charts or tables showing his results apart from the one mentioned above), but if his 200BC-1000AD conclusion is a result of comparing the burnt and battered Shroud to some undisturbed grave cloths, then I suggest that it should carry a serious “environmental weakening” compensatory factor of at least 500 years. 300AD to 1500AD is a much more realistic interpretation of Fanti’s results. In that case, of course, not only does Fanti’s work not undermine the C14 tests, it actually supports them!Perhaps I am being over-optimistic myself here, but nevertheless, it remains true that the dating of cloth by mechanical weakness has yet to achieve any kind of archaeological credibility.In the same boat, so far, are age-related variations in colour, chemistry or vanillin content. As is mentioned in the video, colour experiments gave the Shroud a date of hundreds of years BC, and although Rogers’s work on vanillin is interesting and suggestive, it is insufficiently comprehensive to be considered anything more, yet.It may be that Giulio Fanti’s actual experimental results are more convincing than both his book and his interview, but in that case it is strange that they have never been published, and that his only submitted paper on the subject does not mention them, or the Shroud, at all.","date":"January 11, 2015 at 9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"That’s OK, Piero, although I do not understand what exactly you think is “rubbish.” I have a lot of time for Giulio Fanti, as I do for anyone who actually carries out experiments rather than guessing what ‘would have happened’ and hope I made clear that most of the programme’s problems were with the production, not with the interview itself, which was a model of reserve and rectitude. However, the statement that the Shroud dates from 400AD with a 95% confidence level is not only statistically hopelessly overoptimistic, but also not what Fanti himself says in his book Il Mistero della Sindone, where he appears to give 400AD +/- 600 years as his 95% confidence level, which is more realistic, but less exciting. (See his diagram on p.102). However even this is part of a dating technique which ignores other sources of mechanical weakness than age alone, and is poorly calibrated against other similarly derived ages from cloths of known date. In short, there is nothing in Fanti’s work which seriously undermines the radiocarbon date yet, although it is possible that further studies might.","date":"January 9, 2015 at 12:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Morris et al., X-Ray Fluorescence Investigation of the Shroud of Turin: “The relatively large proportion of calcium (~1 wt %) is most likely underestimated in these results because no account was taken of its distribution within the cloth.

Although Riggi’s observation tends to support Morris’ interpretation, subsequent microscopic examination of the tapes showed little or no calcium compound debris from the Shroud image surface.

As you will know from your own examination of Shroud 2.0, the “drop of blood” which appears between 1:50 and 2:15 in Part 5 of the YouTube video of your lecture to the Jesuit high School Tampa is indisputably a blob of red wax, and looks absolutely nothing like any of the reputed bloodstains. You accompany this photo with the words “…none of the clots are disturbed; they’re complete, perfectly shaped clots as they originally bled out into the cloth.” Actually, as you must know, every single bloodstain has been almost wholly erased, leaving minute particles of blood tucked into interstices of the fibres and threads, and a pinkish stain indicating their original extent.You may well have taken the photo from a shroud book in good faith, but it’s wrong. Regular readers of this blog will know that I very rarely accuse people of fraud or fabrication, and this misidentification is almost certainly an honest mistake, but that doesn’t make it less wrong.From 3:59 of the same video, you say: “So, the atoms disintegrate into all the components of the atom … and radiate 360 degrees in all directions. … But where is the shroud? It’s only at 180 degrees; it’s on the bottom, and it’s the top, so all the radiation going this way [indicates horizontally] doesn’t do anything about an image. Therefore no ears, no cheeks.”In this statement you cover two angles of radiation, not 360. If the tip of the nose, for example, emitted radiation in all directions (an expanding sphere of radiation, in fact), the radiation from that one point alone would contact the shroud as a disc of radius approximately 50cm, most intensely at 90 degrees (vertically above the nose) and diminishing towards the circumference of the disc. The trouble with this is, of course, that every other point on the body would do the same, producing an amorphous blur across the sheet.“These are accurately conveyed theories,” you say.

If, like myself, you found the first half rather dull, and didn’t watch the rest, it is well worth while continuing to the end. For me, a number of interesting points were made:1) The absolute certainty with which the speaker introduced more and more speculative ideas about the walk to Calvary was interesting. I wonder how many of the less knowledgable of his audience assumed that what he said was archaeologically verifed. I appreciate that beginning every sentence with: “This is a tentative reconstruction based on very little” can be simply distracting, but as we got down to the precise details of how ropes were tied around Jesus’s legs, I did feel that he was pushing indisputablility further than was warranted.2) It made me wonder about “shroud lecture audiences” generally. How many people attend  who want to know all the information so that they can make up their own mind, and how many actually just want to be told what to think. I guess it may depend on the venue of the lecture. On this and other sites, we sometimes discuss the ‘argument from authority,’ and generally prefer an argument from evidence, but I fear there are many who not only accept that anything told them in a church must be true, but deliberately use their church as a way of not having to make up their own minds, but to have them made up for them.3) At the end of the lecture, Donald Nohs goes into a much more interesting discussion of the Byzantine Rite liturgy (alhough by now we have no idea how accurately), and the idea that the ‘body’ is resurrected during the mass from the ‘antimention’ which is an image of the burial of Jesus on a small cloth that every Orthodox priest gets given on his ordination. (Western Rites use a ‘corporal’ instead of an ‘antimention,’ which I think confuses things a little.) Nohs’ point is that the liturgy contrasts the cross, which received the live body of Jesus and gave back the dead one, and the shroud, which received the dead body of Jesus and gave back the live one. Naturally, he would derive this liturgy entirely from the existence of the Shroud, while I am inclined to derive the existence of the Shroud from the liturgy. In other words, to paraphrase Voltaire, even if the shroud did not exist, it would be necessary to make one.

Unfortunate, perhaps, but it is not a crime to have a fixed opinion, nor, given that the Catholic Church has no official opinion, a sin.

If the Shroud was made in the 13th/14th century, then somebody made it, and for a reason, and within some kind of cultural context in terms of representation. Thomas de Wesselow pointed out how unnecessary, and how untypical, is the faint image we see on the Shroud, compared to other “miraculous images”, and on those grounds decided that the Shroud wasn’t medieval at all. Charles Freeman agrees with de Wesselow that culturally the image on the Shroud does not look like a forged relic, but seeks another possible context. Paradoxically, while a “miraculous relic” need not have looked “realistic” at all, a stage prop might have gained credibility by being so. Colin Berry’s argument, that the Shroud was meant to look as if it was derived from sweat etc., actually fits better into Charles’s Quem Quaeritis scenario than it does into the forged relic one.There are problems. If the Shroud was much brighter and clearer than it is now, Charles needs to explain how such a uniform disappearance of pigment might have occurred, the apparent absence of any protein to bind the gesso, and the faint images that appear in copies. If the Shroud wasn’t much brighter and clearer than it is now, Colin needs to postulate a method of creating it. (To be fair, he has suggested several). I wonder if there isn’t a middle course – that the Shroud was created to look “realistic” by applying something which had the unexpected (or expected, if experiments had been carried out) effect of degrading the fibres, which when discovered, resulted in the Shroud being thoroughly washed clean of every other substance. Garlaschelli’s experiments with blue paint come to mind.Does old linen contain calcium in “relatively large” proportions? How did the STuRP team know what sort of proportions to expect? Colin suggests that “the calcium content of the Shroud is entirely consistent with the presence of pectins that survive retting.” Am I right in supposing that all flax contains some calcium before retting? And that the retting process removes some or all of it, rather than adding to it as Heller and Adler seem to suggest? In that case, I would expect most pre-industrial linen to have a “relatively large” proportion of calcium compared to modern linen, which has sustained a more thorough retting. Is this in fact the case?As for Charles being a Historian or Colin a scientist, I’m not too bothered about nomenclature. Thanks to Colin I know a lot more about bilirubin and hemicellulose (and much more besides) than I did before, not because I took his word as gospel, but because he gave me ideas to check on elsewhere and on which to build ideas of my own. Thanks to Charles I know a great deal more about the Quem Quaeritis ceremony and the Zittau fastentuch, again, not because his word is law, but because his researches open a door through which other people may pass to discover more about them for themselves. Over the past few years, there has been, in my opinion, an over-reliance on “experts” and a reluctance even to question them for clarification, let alone to disagree with them. To some people, Barbet, Bucklin, Heller, Adler, Rogers and/or several others have attained some kind of unassailable authority which renders any inquiry intio their work almost heretical. Thank goodness neither Colin nor Charles have joined them.

Iron found deposited on linen this way is quite common … In fact, linen makers are specifically enjoined against using ferruginous waters for retting as it will stain the cloth.” Their references for this are Ott, Spurlin and Grafflin, Cellulose and Cellulose Derivatives, which you may already know, and Jahn, The Chemical Behaviour of Wood, in Wood Chemistry journal.If you are correct about the calcium, it seems that iron works in a completely different way.Further, if a “natural” proportion of calcium is 150ppm, and Heller and Adler found 1% by weight (and then only on the surface), then no wonder they referred to a “relatively large” proportion.","date":"January 14, 2015 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Good point. We have to find a 1400AD conjunction of technical and cultural probability. The 3/1 herringbone seems characteristic more of north-west europe than anywhere else, although any cultural characteristic both diffuses outwards from its heartland and also is occasionally simply carried elsewhere so crops up out of context. Otherwise, I have speculated on a Balkan heritage based on the epitaphios, or maybe an altar frontage or dossage, and Charles has suggested his mid-European Quem Quaeritis idea. If middle-eastern, then perhaps it is more likely to have been a deliberate forgery, maybe to feed the European ‘relic-frenzy’, although, as I have also suggested elsewhere, 1400AD was a little late in the day for that. I know nothing about the medieval Christian culture of Egypt or north Africa, but as you suggest, maybe that too would be worth investigating.Re Charles’s comment above:  “the author just mentioned, in an aside, the Turin Shroud as a typical medieval painted linen as if there was no argument about it. She did not even think that she needed to say anything more.” This was Joanna Cannon & Caroline Villers, in the introduction to “The Fabric of Images” compilation (p. ix), and the context in which they say it is worth reading.     “Convenience was not the only motive and the paintings discussed in this collection raise intriguing issues of relative status and value. Were these works [paintings on cloth rather than wood] always conceived of as second best, as more conveniently portable alternatives to panel paintings, or as cheap substitutes for tapestry or embroidery? Might there be a positive spititual, cultic, value to painting on linen in, for example, Perugia, where fixed linen altarpieces may have intentionally recalled, by their appearance, the powerful efficacy of plague banners? Might such miraculous associations stretch even further back, to the example of Veronica, an image believed to have been miraculously imprinted on textile, or (less far back) to the Turin Shroud, itself one of the best-known surviving medieval images on a textile-support? Could a presumed modesty and cheapness in the choice of a textile support also carry desirable connotations of poverty which made the technique especially suitable for the Mendicant Orders? Did the rising appreciation of painterly skill in relation to material value cause a shift in the relation between painting on textiles and embroidery?” Etc, etc. The answer to all these rhetorical questions is, of course, we don’t know.","date":"January 14, 2015 at 10:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"You’ve cost me a fortune Charles!

As a “true scientist” myself I am not only aware of the three papers you cite, but have read them carefully. That was why I asked the question – what do these people think caused the image? Apart from references to “a small quantity of energy” several times, and the absurdly overused word “stochastic,” there is a reference in all of them to “electromagnetic radiation,” but the rejection of UV and corona discharge.Taking the third paper, I do not think Jackson’s “Image intensity” equation can be converted to Fazio and Mandaglio’s “Energy absorption” equation as easily as they seem to think. Jackson could make an empirical measurement that the shroud had a background colour (Ib) which was further darkened by a supposed negative correlation between image and body/cloth distance (Io(1-z/Ro)). That there is a background colour is not disputed, but to supposed that it was caused (as in Fazio’s derived equation) by “the average energy received by the cloth by electromagnetic radiation” is wholly unfounded and unless explained further, almost meaningless. The rest of the equation also refers to the absorption of electromagnetic radiation from the body. Whatever it means, it is clear that “the little quantity of energy” postulated by Fazio is indeed, radiation.The paper makes a stab at the cause of the “little quantity of energy” by suggesting “emission of thermic energy.” Well, well. That’s heat to us “true scientists.”So, sorry, Anonymous, but in spite of a feeble attempt to attribute the source of their “emission of thermic energy” to “the low temperature chemical processes between reducing sugars and amine,” which surely could only occur actually on the surface of the cloth, the entire thrust of the paper is that the image is proportional to the intensity of radiation it received across varying distances.But it’s worse than that, even. It is assumed, wholly without justification, that there is a linear correlation between the energy transmitted from body to cloth and the distance it travels, which is wholly unjustified, and no consideration is given to the exact direction in which the radiation is supposed to have gone – vertically, horizontally, perpendicularly to body or cloth, shortest distance or any other.Finally, if Fazio and Mandaglio were really interested in Rogers’s vapour theories, they should have looked at equations regarding gas dispersal, not electromagnetic radiation intensity.p.s.

Fazio and Mandaglio postulate low levels of thermal radiation to account for the stochastic distribution of coloured sections of flax fibre on the shroud. Their evidence that such a distribution exists at all is weak, their equation relating energy levels to distance radiated is unfounded, and their evidence that such low levels of energy can or do produce any effect at all is non-existent. Their statement that “deterministic processes show great difficulty in the attempts to explain the Shroud body image. Therefore, they must be discarded,” is simply arrogant.

I understand the way you take unsupported assumptions as axiomatic, the way you use non-sequiturs as a way of deflecting attention from contrary arguments, the way you reiterate opinions as facts and the way you assume vague generalisations to be logical conclusions.The variation of colouration of contiguous image fibres has almost nothing to do with the process of their degradation, and much more to do with the individual cellular structure of the fibres themselves. I can produce, and have produced, the discontinuous distribution of colour your describe simply by wiping a heated spatula rapidly over the surface of a piece of cloth. So could you, except that you are not a “real scientist.”You wonder why you waste time exchanging with me if I believe a hot statue could have produced the shroud image, without actually considering what I, or Fazio and Mandaglio, have claimed. They claim that the image could have been made by low level thermal radiation. They do not claim that this radiation must have come from a dead body – it could have come from anything, including a statue. If the image was made by some other process, then a hot statue may not be an appropriate alternative, but that’s not Fazio and Mandaglio’s conclusion.For what it’s worth, I have another experiment underway. Two pieces of cloth in my laboratory, one lying on a table, the other on a heater at about 45°C. Tomorrow I will place both of these in a hot oven, and inspect them every minute or so.

Its identification on the Shroud by Marzia Boi has been based entirely on photographs of type specimens and not on any actual Shroud pollen, either on tape or photographed.2) Be that as it may, Avinoam Danin, in his Flora of Israel site (http://flora.org.il/), lists two species of Helichrysum, pallasii and sanguineum. The former is rare and does not flower till late June and can be rejected. The latter is common, grows around Jerusalem, and flowers in April.3) Helichrysum sanguineum is an entomophilous flower whose pollen could not have blown onto the Sudarium. Its pollen could only have arrived on the blood of the cloth by being placed there. Despite Boi’s etymology (heli-chrysum : sun-gold), H. sanguineum flowers are deep red, are sometimes called the Blood of the Maccabees, and have a similar significance as a memorial to fallen warriors as the poppy does in Western Europe. I do not know when this symbolism emerged, but at face value, the plant does not seem inappropriate for Jesus.4) It is not clear to me what the precise relationship is supposed to have been between the Sudarium and the Shroud.a) Did the Sudarium cover the face, and the Shroud cover the Sudarium? The appearance of the image of the face on the Shroud through two layers of blood soaked Sudarium seems to me incredible.b) Did the Sudarium cover the face for the transport of the body to the tomb, whereupon it was removed and replaced by the Shroud? In which case why should it have been covered with flowers?5) What is the provenance of the sample examined by the electron microscope? To date, at least on this site, there has been absolutely no evidence for any supposed pollen identification of the Sudarium other than vague suggestions. If Max Frei, or anyone else, took tape samples from the Sudarium, when did he do it, where is his report and where are the slides?6) As has been mentioned Helichrysum species are found all over Europe, the pollen in individual species are difficult to identify, so there is nothing in this report that prevents the Sudarium from being an early medieval creation, as suggested by its (also unconfirmed) radiocarbon date.","date":"February 15, 2015 at 9:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/15/important-new-pollen-discovery-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Important New Pollen Discovery on the Sudarium of Oviedo?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"A Soxhlet purification process, which I believe is standard in cases of suspected organic contamination, would have removed the pollutants.

Sorry to be pushy but I only have access to one Greek version of the Acts of Thaddeus (Tischendorf and Lipsius), where ‘rakkos’ does not appear in conjunction with ‘tetradiplon.’ Indeed, it does not appear at all as far as I can see. I would be interested in your context. For the benefit of other readers, there is a point to all this. The word ‘rakkos’ (or ‘rhakos’) does not necessarily mean ragged or tattered, nor does it derive from any word which implies it might. Although it means ragged in the Odyssey, in the bible it refers to the clean new patch which must not be sewn onto old wineskins (Matthew 9:16, Mark 2:21). I think the whole essence of the word is that it is a small piece of cloth cut or torn from a larger piece. If the Edessa image, or the Addai cloth, is anywhere described as a ‘rakkos tetradiplon’, it refers to something much smaller than the Shroud.

It may have been torn, neatly from a larger piece, and if so, the edges were not a clean as a knife cut, but to equate the word’s use in the bible with the dirty, holed sheet you are claiming is wholly unjustified.And I gather that you now agree that the Acts of Thaddeus do not use the phrase “rakkos tetradiplon”. This kind of stuff: “See the Vienna ms (hist. gr. 45) + liturgical instructions (August 16th, Holy Mandylion day) + Georges Kedrenos’ relation in his Synopse des Histoires,” is unhelpful.

It may be that, assuming the Acts of Thaddeus to be referring to a small cloth, that is why Kedrenos introduced it.And I disagree with your opinion about a ‘rakkos’ being as large as the Shroud. You don’t make a small cloth by folding up a large one. The best you have come up with here is a ‘large kerchief’, which by no stretch of the imagination can be 4m long.And no, you didn’t ask me about sindons or himations, you asked Charles.

Giovanni Riggi drew several contradictory diagrams with their dimensions, but how accurate they were seems uncertain.

However, as two of the edges were rolled seams, the actual area of the cloth was greater, about 8.9cm x 2.7cm (but still with the bite).b) Riggi’s second diagram shows the dimensions after the seams were cut off. He gives 7.9cm as the length, and two widths, 1.35cm for the Raes sample end, and 1.70cm for the wider end. The mass is given as 300.00mg. Taking the average of the two widths, the areal density for the trimmed sample is 25.90mg/cm2.c) I do not know where Maria Grazia Siliato (http://www.cirac.org/shroud/Discussion/MGS-CESS-36-42.htm) obtained her dimensions of 7cm x 1cm from.

Barrie Schwortz later photographed this sample, with mm scales, from which it can be calculated that a more accurate value for the area is 0.52cm2 and the areal density therefore 23.83mg/cm2.All in all, this evidence shows no significant discrepancy between the areal density of the radiocarbon sample and the rest of the Shroud. Can anybody refute?And Hi Donn! Good to hear from you. Unfortunately your inability to find evidence for a medieval date for the Shroud is not evidence that such evidence does not exist.

It is my contention, however, that those needs have been supplied. I really don’t think the Pray manuscript shows any knowledge of the Shroud as we know it, that the Sudarium of Oviedo has even been anywhere near the Shroud, that the repair hypothesis is valid, or that the coins and pantocrators were based on the Shroud rather than the other way about. The reasons why I do not find the evidence to the contrary convincing have been explained elsewhere. That is not to say that there isn’t evidence, of course, just that it isn’t as convincing to non-authenticists as it is to authenticists.

The fact that the evidence for the areal densities of the Shroud being different is not very strong does not mean that there isn’t any evidence at all. Nevertheless, DaveB knows very well that the comparison Raes makes above is between the side strip and the rest of his sample, not between the ‘rest of his sample’, which intruded into the radiocarbon corner, and the rest of the Shroud; and that there is some evidence that the side strip does not always precisely line up to the place where is was cut off. As the yarn is of variable width and density, it is not surprising that any particular lengths should differ from one another. Raes himself said: “the count could only be determined on a very short length of material, and we have no indication about the irregularities of the yarn. Therefore it is not possible to state with certainty that Pieces I and II originate from fabrics of different manufacture.”Similarly, as has been continuously pointed out, there are few if any convincing comparable artistic renderings of the dead Christ.

The tomb is a Cadaver Tomb, or Transi, which appears to have developed in medieval Europe towards the end of the 13th century.

One or two things that could be significant – where the cadaver is shown naked, one or both hands invariably cover his genitals, as I think the left hand does in your example above (Bishop Richard Fleming of Lincoln, and see the tomb of John FitzAlan, 14th Earl of Arundel, for a clearer example), and in at least one example, the cadaverous part of the double effigy is carved in bas relief.This is a whole new avenue of exploration, I reckon.

I really don’t think it either stubborn or cynical to say that the zigzag patterns on the lid of the sepulchre in the Pray manuscript look nothing at all like herringbone weave, or that the two unexplained patterns of circles on both the tomb and the lid are not necessarily representations of holes in the Shroud.I think before I could be accused of unnecessary obduracy I would like to see any other representation of herringbone which resembles a series of concentric zigzag ‘semi-circles’ centred on different points at the edges on a rectangle, and also any other representation of Three Marys iconography showing a piece of cloth as a rigid sub-rectangle at an unlikely angle.I can see that to Nabber, and no doubt to many other readers, similarities between the Pray codex and the Shroud are wholly unequivocal, but I hope that most of them will be able to understand that it is possible to disagree without being either stubborn or cynical.","date":"October 30, 2015 at 9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/28/banding-proves-cloth-was-not-repaired/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Banding Proves Cloth Was Not Repaired?"},{"author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hugh: “To the best of my knowledge no threads from areas away from the C14 corner have been analysed.”O.K.: “So your knowledge is poor.

The cloth appeared to be pure linen,” and “Samples from the main part of the cloth are significantly different from the Raes samples and the radiocarbon sample with regard to cotton content.” Finally, of a tape sample from the ankle, “Absolutely no cotton could be found among the hundreds of fibres on this tape sample.”This hardly constitutes a blanket denial across the shroud, although it does suggest that cotton content is both small and variable. That would be in keeping with random fibres mixed in with the weaving, but not, I think, with any deliberate attempt to spin mixed flax/cotton thread.Supposing one did want to spin a flax/cotton mixed thread – perhaps to combine durability with comfort or something similar.

You do not need to be any kind of scientist to think that 2% is a different number from 100%.Still, never mind, I note that after my detailed, clear and referenced response to your comment at 3:43 on 21 October, in which you wondered if anybody on this blog was intelligent, you suddenly introduced for the first time the question of vanillin and had the boldness to suggest that it was I who had ignored it.Not at all. Rogers’s observations are extremely interesting. The 1978 STURP tests for lignin had proved negative across the shroud, whereas Rogers did detect it on Raes threads given to him 20 years later. There are a number of possible reasons for this, but I don’t know enough about them, yet, to be able to account for it. I note that a description of madder root dye, which Rogers also found, says that it contains three coloured chemicals (alizarin, purpurin and xanthin) and also lignin, gum, sugar, resin, and various other minor chemicals.

I do not dispute that for a moment. I wish I could ask him if it is possible that the positive vanillin test came from the madder rather than the threads, as the standard test he describes would not differentiate between the two.Nor does Rogers at any time say, or even imply, that he tested main shroud threads for vanillin.

To the best of my knowledge no threads from areas away from the C14 corner have been analysed.The sticky tape slides were analysed by Heller and Adler (A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin), who say: “The microscopic survey revealed that there were a large variety of fibrils and particulates present in the samples along with occasional assorted “incidental” debris found in limited quantities such as insect parts, pollen, spores, wax, modern synthetic fibrils, red and blue silk, wool, and flair tip pen dye marks (due to a previous investigator).” They do not mention cotton as “incidental” debris, but then nor do they identify the “variety” of the fibrils they observed.The slides were also analysed by Walter McCrone (Judgement Day for the Turin Shroud), who says: “Since the extraneous but rare particles may be of interest, I will list them: silk, wool, linen and cotton fibres of various colours, wax spatters, bird feather fibres, rodent hairs, mica, limestone (calcite), quartz, aragonite, starch grains (corn and wheat), pollen (average less than 2-3 pollen grains per tape), mold spores, trichomes (leaf hairs), flash (oil soot, power plant, incinerator, trash burning, Jeweler’s rouge, paper fibres, pigments (madder, orpiment, yellow ochre, azurite), paint fragments (titanium white, ultramarine, yellow ochre), plant and insect parts, charred linen fibres, etc.” I wonder how Heller and Adler came to miss all that!Neither of the above descriptions seems to be at all definitive. It is clear from both sources that the composition of the woven material was assumed to be linen, and no consideration was given to any possible admixture, all the non-linen fibres being dismissed as ‘incidental’ or ‘extraneous.’And that brings us to Gérard Lucotte’s highly controversial examination of some fibres hoovered up from between the shroud and its backing. He says: “Nous avons pu computer lors de notre dénombrement 16 fibres individuelles de cotton (pour 137 fibres de lin).” (about 10%)Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?
