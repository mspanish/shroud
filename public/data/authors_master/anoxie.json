In Adler’s spectrum is there a shoulder in the 425 480 range that corresponds with such, that could be identified confidently? If so, are any quantitative conclusions possible? 3. Also, the picture in #134 is with Hb:O2 with 2 concentrations of fresh bilirubin added? Or is this incorrect? This is not from Adler’s papers, but a separate experiment (yours, others?) 4. What are your thoughts on how bilirubin or its degradation products & methemoglobin are represented in Adler’s spectral profiles? I don’t have Adler’s paper. But the shoulder in the 428 480 range on the picture, comment #134, is directly correlated to the level of bilirubin. It is a method based on visible spectroscopy to quantify the concentration of bilirubin in cerebrospinal fluid (and differentiate hemorrhage from traumatic puncture). Kelly Kearse : 2. Help me out a little with the red is 620 750, you’re saying that increased bilirubin would not correspond with this region anyway, so one cannot attribute a red color to just bilirubin by itself? Increased bilirubin increases absorption under 500 nm, whereas brownish color of old blood should come from lower absorbance over 500 nm.

The temperature gradients will have a large effect on Maillard reaction rates. These combination of factors could produce a distribution of reaction products with the appearance of the image. Rogers assumed there must have been steep temperature gradients on the shroud to explain image resolution since he thought the origin of the reactive amines should be in the lungs. He admitted himself “The chemistry of the colour does not answer all questions about how the “photographic” image formed. I think the body had cooled down when reactive amines hit the cloth.

If you look at the areal density of color on the face you can see there may be a saturation on cheeks, nose, eyebrows, hair, beard. On these areas the limiting factor may be reducing saccharides.

This suggests that the image was not produced by any mechanism that involved heat, light, or ionizing radiation.” Di Lazzaro uses bursts of UV light and creates radiation damage ( see fig. 12 https://www.academia.edu/3478909/Superficial and Shroud like coloration of linen by short laser pulses in the vacuum ultraviolet ).

Actually this hypothesis requires many parameters, the value of each being important to get a final image. Part I, MAILLARD REACTION IN DETAIL : 1/Sugars layer The nature and thickness of the layer depends on the amount of wetting agent (S. Officinalis) and the type of ground grains used to make crude starch. 2/Reactive amines The reactive amines should come from the skin. They could have concentrated from sweat or direct plasma exudation from the wounds. Reactive amines would slowly appear at the surface of the skin. Rogers used DETA (diethylenetriamine) mw 103.2 in his experiments, and used it directly (no slow production or release), there was no convection, but you can see the borders of image are not straight, certainly due to a quick release of amines responsible for a flooding. In your article, you suggested ammonia through hydrolysis of urea. But is hydrolysis of urea significant at ambient temperature ? Have you thought about glutamine ? glutamine is available in plasma and sweat, and in large amounts in muscle cells (~20 mmol/L). Under a stress and/or trauma there is an accelerated outward transport from muscle cells. Hydrolysis of glutamine is much faster than hydrolysis of urea at lower temperature. There may be other amines, main ones should be determined before any experiment. 3/Contact/Gas diffusion There may be reactive reacting through contact (glutamine), while other could diffuse (ammonia). And there may be different products, through different pathways, giving different coloration. 4/Reaction completion This is an “autocatalytic” type reaction, which increases contrast (the closer the darker) and resolution (lesser spread of gaseous amines). How long is the “induction time” depending on the concentration of gaseous amines ? During this time, the rate will closely follow a zero order rate law and contrast will be “diffusion controlled”. This may explain partly why resolution seems higher on the face (more autocatalytic) than on other parts (more diffusion controlled). “Extinction coefficient” is important but hardly evaluable. 5/Path length dependent attenuation of the concentration It is not simply due to a concentration gradient based on Kinetic Theory of Gases, we should take into account a complex absorbing boundary. Absorbing boundary (cloth), whose strength depends on time, adsorption, absorption, depletion of reactant(s), thus the type of linen and weaving, thickness of the sugars layer, local level of completion.

CB has used image J and claimed: “Straightaway one can see that the sharp cut off at the sides of the face, aka excessive and unrealistic ‘linearity’, disappears almost completely.” My answer was: look at high definition raw pictures and you can see a sharp cutt off. Anyone can see it, and i think Hugh has finally (hardly?) admitted it when he has noted that the dark band starts on a spike. This zig zag pattern is underlined by the difference image (middle one), and has a role on the image intensity (left one). Claiming that looking at image J, which actually smoothes the image largely discussed here , you can’t see this cut off, is simply absurd! But maybe this spoonfeeding will trigger another version in CB far fetched theories..","date":"2014-08-28","mins":"9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/27/banding-is-it-real/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Banding?

That a clear image (comparable with the image on the Shroud) can be made on a recipient surface by gases that rise in a thermal current and retain, during their movement, the details of the surface, (wounds, fingers etc) from which they were released. I don’t speculate thermal current/convection blur the image, this results from equations of diffusion. Read carefully Rogers’ mail, there is no mention of a thermal current when he describes the diffusion mechanism. And when he run his tests he concluded that thermal current/convection blurred the image. The conditions to get the highest resolution are no thermal current. Plus you should note that diffusion is only a mechanism among others. Kinetics of the gas solid reaction itself increases the contrast. Any experiment is welcome, but you should be aware of the limitations.

Science is a set of methods aimed at testing hypotheses and building theories.” And from Ray Rogers defining the scientific method : ” Science is not “things.” It is a way of thinking. Classical Scientific Method is simply a method for objectively applying logic to the solution of problems. 1) The problem must be stated in clear terms, and obscure words must be defined clearly. The goal sought must also be stated clearly. 2) Everything known about the problem must be studied, and all references must be acknowledged. There must be no “hidden facts,” and it is not clever to “blind side” the opposition. Carefully planned observations should be made. Different methods of observation should be made when possible, and results must be checked for internal consistency and agreement with reported results. All observations must be taken seriously, until some justifiable and clearly stated reason can be found to eliminate any. 3) A “brainstorming” session, preferably with other workers familiar with the problem, should try to develop as many potential explanations (hypotheses) as possible (Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses), All hypotheses must be clearly stated. And 4), all of the hypotheses must be tested equally against the same, complete list of observations and facts. Testing may often involve making predictions on the basis of the hypotheses and testing the predictions by experiment. The Principle of Parsimony (Occam’s Razor) states that the hypothesis that includes the largest number of facts and observations will be closest to the truth. Hypotheses that do not accept many facts without “special pleading” should be discarded.” This is science.

Once again, evidence based medecine is that a damage nerve results in a motor deficit, even after a trauma. In order to directly study the mechanical stimulation of crushing, Barbet should have crushed the median nerve in the forearm, not in the wrist just beside/through the ligament and the carpal bones. “Obviously law and ethics now preclude such experiments so we must rely on Dr.Barbet’s honesty describing the results and frankly I see no reason for doubting him” Obviously you can take a freshly amputated limb from a rabbit or a cow, and squeeze/brush/pierce the sciatic nerve for example, at distance from an articulation.
