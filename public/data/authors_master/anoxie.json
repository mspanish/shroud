This suggests that the image was not produced by any mechanism that involved heat, light, or ionizing radiation.”\nDi Lazzaro uses bursts of UV light and creates radiation damage ( see fig. 12 https://www.academia.edu/3478909/Superficial_and_Shroud-like_coloration_of_linen_by_short_laser_pulses_in_the_vacuum_ultraviolet ).

They could have concentrated from sweat or direct plasma exudation from the wounds. Reactive amines would slowly appear at the surface of the skin.\nRogers used DETA (diethylenetriamine) mw 103.2 in his experiments, and used it directly (no slow production or release), there was no convection, but you can see the borders of image are not straight, certainly due to a quick release of amines responsible for a flooding.\nIn your article, you suggested ammonia through hydrolysis of urea. But is hydrolysis of urea significant at ambient temperature ? Have you thought about glutamine ? glutamine is available in plasma and sweat, and in large amounts in muscle cells (~20 mmol/L). Under a stress and/or trauma there is an accelerated outward transport from muscle cells. Hydrolysis of glutamine is much faster than hydrolysis of urea at lower temperature.\nThere may be other amines, main ones should be determined  before any experiment.\n3/Contact/Gas diffusion\nThere may be reactive reacting through contact (glutamine), while other could diffuse (ammonia). And there may be different products, through different pathways, giving different coloration.\n4/Reaction completion\nThis is an “autocatalytic” type reaction, which increases contrast (the closer the darker) and resolution (lesser spread of gaseous amines).\nHow long is the “induction time” depending on the concentration of gaseous amines ? During this time, the rate will closely follow a zero-order rate law and contrast will be “diffusion controlled”.\nThis may explain partly why resolution seems higher on the face (more autocatalytic) than on other parts (more diffusion controlled).\n“Extinction coefficient” is important but hardly evaluable.\n5/Path-length dependent attenuation of the concentration\nIt is not simply due to a concentration gradient based on Kinetic Theory of Gases, we should take into account a complex absorbing boundary.\nAbsorbing boundary (cloth), whose strength depends on time, adsorption, absorption, depletion of reactant(s), thus the type of linen and weaving, thickness of the sugars layer, local level of completion.\nThe more the parameters, the lower the odds to get an image.

Classical Scientific Method is simply a method for objectively applying logic to the solution of problems. 1) The problem must be stated in clear terms, and obscure words must be defined clearly. The goal sought must also be stated clearly. 2) Everything known about the problem must be studied, and all references must be acknowledged. There must be no “hidden facts,” and it is not clever to “blind side” the opposition. Carefully planned observations should be made. Different methods of observation should be made when possible, and results must be checked for internal consistency and agreement with reported results. All observations must be taken seriously, until some justifiable and clearly stated reason can be found to eliminate any. 3) A “brainstorming” session, preferably with other workers familiar with the problem, should try to develop as many potential explanations (hypotheses) as possible (Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses), All hypotheses must be clearly stated. And 4), all of the hypotheses must be tested equally against the same, complete list of observations and facts. Testing may often involve making predictions on the basis of the hypotheses and testing the predictions by experiment. The Principle of Parsimony (Occam’s Razor) states that the hypothesis that includes the largest number of facts and observations will be closest to the truth. Hypotheses that do not accept many facts without “special pleading” should be discarded.”\nThis is science.
