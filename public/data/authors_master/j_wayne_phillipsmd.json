{"resources":[{"author":"j_wayne_phillipsmd","post":"Hello. I am J.Wayne Phillips, MD who is slightly misquoted by Dan using “Vatican Apostolorum College” incorrectly.The college is the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum College. Hugh is correct. However, I beg to differ with Hugh, but the wax IS blood. The blood photo was not made by me but taken from a shroud book. Hugh is accusing that author of fabrication. Also the theories of Jackson, Fanti, and Paczek include a need of a radiation released in a 360 degree fashion with some degree of simultaneous flattening of the cloth. Therefore the sides of the body show no image since the cloth no longer covered the sides. These are accurately portrayed theories. Hugh seems to think that these are my ideas but I have no personal theories  in this presentation. All ideas come from the SSG experts. I am a messenger only.\n\n","date":"April 11, 2014 at 9:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/new-dvd-of-the-women-of-grace-programs-on-the-shroud-plus-some/","cat":"lectures","title":"New DVD of the Women of Grace Programs on the Shroud Plus Some"}]}
