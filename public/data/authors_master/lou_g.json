If I make a statue and tell you it is art, it is art, no matter what you think of it. If I tell you it is an ancient pagan god or a Leprechaun turned to stone by an evil spirit or anything other than a work of art, it is no longer art no matter the original intent or how artistic it may seem .

That is regrettable.\n\n","date":"October 12, 2010 at 2:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/10/10/troubled-by-the-new-shroud-of-turin-3d-web-site/","cat":"art","title":"Troubled by the New Shroud of Turin 3D Web Site"}]}
