My fear originated about 55 years ago when I realized that I would die some day. I have found life so beautiful and awe some that not feeling it would be the ultimate dread. No, I do not come from a priviledged background, in fact I would consider our family as a poor working class, but over the years we worked hard and had our share of trials and tribulations. Today, I consider ourselves blessed with healthy and independent children and their families. My struggle against my fear has led me to reading many books, medications, and counselling and ultimately to baptism into the Catholic faith. Being retired for the last 9 years, I have a lot of time thinking about God, death, etc. My conclusion is that if there is no God, then life is meaningless. God has 100% of my heart and about 80% of my mind. I desparately seek closure on this fear, so I can fully appreciate life and let it go gracefully. I pray very often these days that God would send some “agent” or event that would put my mind to rest. This is the reason that read posts such as these – to find new ways of reaching God or better still, have God reaching me. I would appreciate any suggestion that would remove my residual doubt.

I think it’s important that this discussion/explanation be made available widely so other “innocent” Christians wouldn’t be subjected to unnecessary painful test of their faith. Yannick, you expressed very well how I approach my faith and even though I was baptised into the Catholic faith some 25 years ago, I still question some basic tenets of our faith and continue to read other religious materials. For example, I have read a few of Neale Walsch’s books : “Conversations with God”, “Communion with God” and “Home with God”. I would appreciate some comments on Walsch’s work. I would my faith to be an elightened one therefore I don’t accept everything in the bible as true. Clearly some are allegories and metaphors, but I do accept the general thesis of the bible. Could someone tackle the following questions: 1) It is thru Christ that we have redemption. What happened to those souls who predated Christ? 2) In Luke 21:29, “remember that all these things will take place before the people now living have all died”. I think Christ was referring to certain events (things) will happen before His second coming, BUT before all the people who were living at that time have died. That is, Christ was supposed come back before that generation had passed away. Is this the right interpretation? 3) The Old Testament portrayed God like an ordinary being – full of vengeance, and hate etc. These can’t be the attributes of a loving and merciful God. How to reconcile the descriptions of God between the Old and New Testaments.

I have never read such in depth biblical and relevant scientific knowledge on the Shroud as in this site. Daveb, my view of God is more along the line of Neale Walsch, but not as extreme in some cases. Neale purportedly recorded the dialogues between God and him in a somewhat trance state. The first 3 books of Conversations with God were “mere” records of these dialogues. Book1 explains the reason for God creating the world in the first place, and the souls come into being because they seek certain sensations or feelings. Therefore there are no villians or victims because all are willing participants. Far feteched as it may seem, Hilter came to the world to have his “fantasy” fulfilled and the same for the holocaust victims. All are playing their roles. In Neale’s God’s world, there is no good or evil as everything is relative in this world. (I agree with that to a degree and this really echoes a famous writer who said that “nothing is good or evil but only thinking makes so.. May have misquoted this.) Eventually we all reunite with God and will come back to this world many times to have different experiences. I am not doing justice to Neale’s work as I am writing strictly from memory of material I read over 10 years ago. I highly recommend Neale’s Book1 to theists and atheists because of its intellectual merits alone. God bless everyone and thanks again.
