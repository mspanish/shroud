{"resources":[{"author":"gabriel_(spain)","post":"I am afraid that a chemical analysis of the eyes’ area of the Shroud could not give any clue at all, since that would imply that some transfer of metalic matter from the “coins” to the Shroud’s fibers took place. Something impossible. In my opinion, the only analysis that could throw some light is the high resolution images analyzed in a reproducible way according to the state of the art as admitted by the scientific community and not following any other more “creative” way, something that unfortunately, we have seen in too many occasions……But chemistry is a discipline that cannot help in this issue. Coming to the plasubility of the coins being put on the eyes of the Messiah, there is a great controversy regarding the influence of the greek culture at that time. I wouldn`t rule it out completely that such a costume was so widely spred among pagans and jews too that for the last had lost its pagan meaning and only reflected perhaps some kind of respect towards the dead person. We see that in Western countries with christian roots, non-christians (muslims, hindis, jews…) ALSO buy presents for their families in Christmas. I mean, something that started as something religious has become purely cultural and common to all. But I don`t want to go too far with this because I am not sure at all and I am just hypotethisezing .\n\n","date":"October 23, 2011 at 6:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/23/paper-chase-max-patrick-hamon-on-the-coin-on-eye-issue/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Max Patrick Hamon on the Coin-on-Eye Issue"},{"author":"gabriel_(spain)","post":"A chemical analysis could only determine if the composition of the fibres from some section of the Shroud (eyes for example) is different from others. I don`t think that can possibly happen.\nA spectral analysis would be part of a comprehensive image analysis, not only in the visible band but also at different UV and IR wavelengths. I mean, this would fall in the realm of Optics if, as I mentioned in my previous post, the whole analysis -which is far too much than discovering “objects”-, is carried out according to the generally admitted scientific standards as described in the scientific literature.\nOne point which in my opinion should be incorporated into the analysis is a thorough comparison of the spectra from the Shroud and those obtained on linen sheets by Paolo DiLAzzaro using laser beams. In case they showed some similarity, this could throw light on the mechanisms involved in the formation of the image. To summarize, an in-depth optical analysis should go far beyond discovering “objects”.\nned\n\n","date":"October 24, 2011 at 2:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/23/paper-chase-max-patrick-hamon-on-the-coin-on-eye-issue/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Max Patrick Hamon on the Coin-on-Eye Issue"},{"author":"gabriel_(spain)","post":"Most interesting post by Max. For me at least, this is new!! If I understand well Max, could detect two coin imprints originated from tiny blood  stains by directly examinating the Shroud. In my opinion, this puts nows the coins issue at the same level of credibility that the flowers (quite high). The other detection of coins by Filas and the rest came from “creative” analysis of images, which in my opinion makes these detections highly dubtious.\nThe methodology of  “flowers& coins discovering” is what makes Avinoma’s and MAx’s claims quite plausible.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2011 at 8:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/23/paper-chase-max-patrick-hamon-on-the-coin-on-eye-issue/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Max Patrick Hamon on the Coin-on-Eye Issue"}]}
