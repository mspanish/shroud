{"art":[{"id":"comment-2819","author":"craig_johnson","post":"I Had a near death experience in the early 70’s. I had just finished reading this book “Heaven Is For Real”. I finished reading it at work on my breaks, and read about the painting of Akaine. I had Jesus meet me in the in between worlds. I never went to Heaven, but Jesus definietly saved me from Satan, so to speak. He greeted me with open arms,and without words, I had the choice of passing into Heaven, or returning to earhtly home, or maybe Christ was telling me it was not my time, but I was so very close to passing the threshold.A few months later, I was reading The National Enquirer, and in the back there was the ad section. I was just scanning thru there and I was stunned by one little ad. It was for The Shroud Of Turin, and had a small picture. It hit me like a ton of bricks! It was “THEE FACE OF CHRIST” that I had seen. I found the book very interesting,and I was very eager to check the painting out. When i found this website, i was really amazed that the “TRUTH PREVAILS”,I am hoping to send a message to Coltons father about my experience, and also about one of his comments. I have previously only told my brother, and a couple of other people about my experience..","date":"2011-04-06","mins":"9:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
