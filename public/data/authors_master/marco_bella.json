Lack of evidence: the paper should be dismissed.Regarding the detection of vanillin by mass spectrometry: it is not so simple. Let’s medical doctors read X-ray scans and chemists mass spectra. First of all, we should consider that the peak seen in mass spectrometry are not correlated in a linear way with concentration. A peak can be higher than another but actually be less abundant. Then, the peak you see might actually not be the molecular peak (152 in the case of vanillin), but a fragment.

However, we should take into account the instrument used and the settings.Rogers wrote:———–…The chemical-ionization system used was the most sensitive MS at the time, sufficiently sensitive to detect parts per-billion traces of oligomers from the polyethylene bag that Gonella had used to wrap the Raes threads. The instrument at MCMS is equipped with a pulsed source…———-Since there is absolutely no other peak below M=49, it is most likely that the instrument was set to not acquire this part of the spectra. This is very common, because the peaks at low masses have little diagnostic value and their intensity might interfere with the other peaks, so it is better to cut them.

No other part of the shroud shows such a coating. The early thermal evolution of furfural during pyrolysis/ms analyses, the relatively easy water solubility, the yellow color formed with iodine, and the easy hydrolysis suggest gum Arabic. Gum Arabic is obtained from Acacia senegal and is composed of pentose-sugar units. Its presence as a major component in the coatings on the Raes and radiocarbon samples is not a surprise, because it has long been a common vehicle in tempera paints. The radiocarbon sample had been dyed. Dyeing was probably done intentionally on pristine replacement material to match the color of the older, sepia-colored cloth…————–So, the presence of Arabic gum is “suggested” by:1)“thermal evolution of furfural [peak at M=96] during pyrolysis”> the peak at M=96 belongs to the cluster of the contaminant and, as said many times, could be many different things. A single peak in mass spectrometry is not enough to confirm anything.2)“Relatively easily [relatively respect to what?] water solubility”, you tell me which significance that has. Millions of substance dissolve in water, starting from salt and sugar.3)“yellow color formed with iodine” Millions of compounds form a yellow color with iodine, therefore it is used in most chemistry laboratories around the world to stain the TLC spots.You tell me how reliable this identification is. You also wrote:———–>On the other hand, the spectrum is not very far from >what Rogers concluded, in particular, furfural [the >peak at M=96] appears present in that spectrum and >the intensity at m/z 126 is negligible.———-Please refer again to the “pink dragon argument” illustrated above.

Briefly, response is not linear in mass spectrometry, and the ratio of peaks intensity changes with pyrolysis temperature (which Rogers did not report), so your argument is meaningless. Don’t DIY in science.—————>In other words, something else appears at play with >that spectrum and it could be what Rogers concluded…————–Nothing can be concluded if you do not have enough evidence. The pyrolysis mass spectra have been taken in the eighties and left in a drawer for about twenty years. They resurfaced only to support the “invisible mending” theory. Why? Reasoning in the same way Rogers did in his paper I could easily say that there is an invisible pink dragon in my garage.

With those spectra done in the eighties, we can just conclude that one is contaminated with a compound bearing a long aliphatic chain and besides that, they are the same.I tried to answer to all your concerns in this forum because it might be useful also for others, but if you need additional information for your article, please feel free to contact me.","date":"September 22, 2015 at 3:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"——————-Why did I not pay more attention when the paper was included in the Proceedings of the International Workshop on the Scientific approach to the Acheiropoietos Images in Frascati in 2010?—————–Maybe because the lyric singer Giovanna De Liso is more known for telling about her experiences of “alien abduction” and her photos of UFO.Sorry: only Italian——–http://oggiscienza.it/2012/10/01/alieni-energia-piezonucleare-e-fusione-fredda/","date":"November 13, 2015 at 4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/13/nevertheless-the-images-are-real-enough/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nevertheless, the images are real enough!"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"I am surely not denigrating anyone!I enjoy classic music and I believe that Giovanna De Liso is a good singer.

Highest costs in the STURP examination of 1978 should have probably been logistic and instrumentation. However, today we can get much more information with a fraction of that money. Just imagine how computers and cell phones (!!) looked in the eighties. A smartphone of today probably cost much less of the biggest computer available at that time and it is much more powerful. The same is true for scientific apparatus. The mass spectrometer reported in Rogers’ papers was at that time a state-of-the-art apparatus, but today it is a technological fossil. With tiny amounts of sample a lot of questions can be answered. What is really needed is few reliable people who collect the samples and distribute to the selected laboratories. I believe that it should be relatively easy to find private sponsors and we are not looking to huge amounts.Real issues for new tests are not scientific, technological or financial, but human (get permission from Vatican; select trustable scientists; avoid “McCrone”-like cases, in which someone that says something “undesired” is out of the project, and so on).","date":"October 10, 2015 at 12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/09/no-closer-to-the-truth-because-of-simony/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"No Closer to the Truth Because of Simony"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"Not that it really matters, but I understand that Gonnella made a survey of STURP team members’  religious beliefs.

If new studies should be done, they should be conducted as far as possible from the STURP approach. The STURP members payed most of their campaign of research by themselves. I am not sure that someone did actually receive a salary. In this way, one does not select the best scientists, but just those who strongly believe in the “mystery”. People who finance the research should be distinct from the scientists actually operating. A committee should raise the money. Conflicts of interest should be avoided as much as possible. The committee should select scientists who can present a scientifically sound research project, possibly not anymore regarding datation (since this is one of the few sure aspect). This project should be evaluated together with the scientist CV (expertise, education, scientific achievements etc). Radiocarbon can be repeated since it will not require much material as the one in 1988, and the new analysis can restrict the data range. Actually, the idea of Rogers to perform it on the charred material is a good one. Except from C14, I believe that the analysis should be decided by the scientists, not the people raising the money.","date":"October 9, 2015 at 4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/09/no-closer-to-the-truth-because-of-simony/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"No Closer to the Truth Because of Simony"}],"resources":[{"author":"marco_bella","post":"Sorry.…actually, we do not need to GO that far…","date":"September 12, 2015 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/09/significant-response-to-the-preview-of-the-thermochimica-acta-editorial/","cat":"article","title":"Significant Response to the Preview of the Thermochimica Acta Editorial"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"Piero wrote:————… we have to know what is the probable compound of for that alkyl chain…———–Actually, we do not need to do that far… we just need to read what Rogers wrote in his paper.———–“…The chemical-ionization system used was the most sensitive MS at the time, sufficiently sensitive to detect parts per-billion traces of oligomers from the polyethylene bag that Gonella had used to wrap the Raes threads…”————It happens that “oligomers from polyethylene” show a spectra which peaks differ by 14 atomic mass units.

He did not mention these foreign peaks due to the contamination in his discussion of the spectra.
