However, oligomers of polyethylene would actually give compatible spectra. 2) ——— >more precise determination would require an >identification of the other peaks, in particular peak m/z >131, which you have not identified its provenance. —— Correct, but the fact that this peak is present as the major peak in both spectra (not considering contamination) points towards identity of the two samples, therefore actually denying the “medieval invisible mending” theory. Please notice that it is Rogers which should have given evidence about the “invisible mending”. Let’s assume you affirm that there is a “pink invisible dragon” in your garage which only you can see, giving only a very confused photo. Your job is to demonstrate this statement; my job is just to say that the photo is really confusing and that there is no evidence. 3) ——– >But more importantly, your determination of the >abundance of m/z 96 coming from the “contaminant” >is unproven in your publication..etc ……….. This is unproven in Rogers’ paper. Surely, the contaminant would have this peak, and we do not have any element to say it is furfural.

If the relative abundance of a peak is too low, it would not be quantified in mass spectra. Rogers, in order to show the absence of the peak at M=126 should have taken a cleaner spectra, where the major peak would be in both the one at M=131. Since this was not done, again we do not have any evidence.

No other part of the shroud shows such a coating. The early thermal evolution of furfural during pyrolysis/ms analyses, the relatively easy water solubility, the yellow color formed with iodine, and the easy hydrolysis suggest gum Arabic. Gum Arabic is obtained from Acacia senegal and is composed of pentose sugar units. Its presence as a major component in the coatings on the Raes and radiocarbon samples is not a surprise, because it has long been a common vehicle in tempera paints. The radiocarbon sample had been dyed. Dyeing was probably done intentionally on pristine replacement material to match the color of the older, sepia colored cloth… ————– So, the presence of Arabic gum is “suggested” by: 1)“thermal evolution of furfural [peak at M=96] during pyrolysis”> the peak at M=96 belongs to the cluster of the contaminant and, as said many times, could be many different things. A single peak in mass spectrometry is not enough to confirm anything. 2)“Relatively easily [relatively respect to what?] water solubility”, you tell me which significance that has. Millions of substance dissolve in water, starting from salt and sugar. 3)“yellow color formed with iodine” Millions of compounds form a yellow color with iodine, therefore it is used in most chemistry laboratories around the world to stain the TLC spots. You tell me how reliable this identification is. You also wrote: ———– >On the other hand, the spectrum is not very far from >what Rogers concluded, in particular, furfural [the >peak at M=96] appears present in that spectrum and >the intensity at m/z 126 is negligible. ——— Please refer again to the “pink dragon argument” illustrated above. Find someone that knows how mass spectrometry works and ask how confident would the expert be to say that “…the spectrum is not very far from what Rogers concluded…” ———— >My second point is that you made an error by over >interpreting that spectrum… ———— The title of our editorial is “There is no mass spectrometry evidence that the C14 sample from the Shroud of Turin comes from a “medieval invisible mending”. Please refer again to the “pink dragon argument”. What about the interpretation of Rogers? Can we speak of over interpretation here, should we use your standard? Do you really think he did present convincing arguments to dismiss what the textile experts stated after direct analysis of the Shroud? ———— >You also made a clear call on m/z 126, stating that it >would become a value similar to the spectrum from >the image only sample once the contaminant was >removed. But, this is arithmetically impossible if you do >some simple calculation, whatever that contaminant is. >(multiple by 4 (the ratio for m/z 131 between the two >spectra) the near zero value of m/z 126, and you >certainly cannot get close to 25 as in the image only >spectrum.) ———— Again, go to an expert in mass spectrometry and ask. Briefly, response is not linear in mass spectrometry, and the ratio of peaks intensity changes with pyrolysis temperature (which Rogers did not report), so your argument is meaningless. Don’t DIY in science. ————— >In other words, something else appears at play with >that spectrum and it could be what Rogers concluded… ————– Nothing can be concluded if you do not have enough evidence. The pyrolysis mass spectra have been taken in the eighties and left in a drawer for about twenty years. They resurfaced only to support the “invisible mending” theory. Why? Reasoning in the same way Rogers did in his paper I could easily say that there is an invisible pink dragon in my garage. About pseudoscience, here it is what is written on Wikipedia: ————— Pseudoscience is a claim, belief or practice which is incorrectly presented as scientific, but does not adhere to a valid scientific method, cannot be reliably tested, or otherwise lacks scientific status. Pseudoscience is often characterized by the use of vague, contradictory, exaggerated or unprovable claims, an over reliance on confirmation rather than rigorous attempts at refutation, a lack of openness to evaluation by other experts, and a general absence of systematic processes to rationally develop theories. A field, practice, or body of knowledge can reasonably be called pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms. ———— Decide by yourself what can be considered pseudoscience among “invisible mending theory”, Rogers’ paper and our editorial, using as benchmark the above definition.

It is difficult to understand mass spectra. With pyrolysis mass spectra you warm up a sample, chemical compounds are broken down, you see only some fragments. You have to solve a complex puzzle, sometimes without all the pieces. It might be feasible if you have one or two compounds, but with several molecules hardly any conclusion can be drawn. Consider that pyrolysis mass spectra was a technique used in the eighties. Do you remember the technology at that time? How computers and mobile phones looked like? Today, mass spectrometry has completely different instrumentation, and can give totally different information. With those spectra done in the eighties, we can just conclude that one is contaminated with a compound bearing a long aliphatic chain and besides that, they are the same.

Highest costs in the STURP examination of 1978 should have probably been logistic and instrumentation. However, today we can get much more information with a fraction of that money. Just imagine how computers and cell phones (!!) looked in the eighties. A smartphone of today probably cost much less of the biggest computer available at that time and it is much more powerful. The same is true for scientific apparatus. The mass spectrometer reported in Rogers’ papers was at that time a state of the art apparatus, but today it is a technological fossil. With tiny amounts of sample a lot of questions can be answered. What is really needed is few reliable people who collect the samples and distribute to the selected laboratories. I believe that it should be relatively easy to find private sponsors and we are not looking to huge amounts. Real issues for new tests are not scientific, technological or financial, but human (get permission from Vatican; select trustable scientists; avoid “Mc Crone” like cases, in which someone that says something “undesired” is out of the project, and so on)..","date":"2015-10-10","mins":"12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/09/no-closer-to-the-truth-because-of-simony/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"No Closer to the Truth Because of Simony"},{"id":"comment-212159","author":"marco_bella","post":"…the STURP results should be the starting point… ———— The starting point should be the radiocarbon done in 1988, when no STURP member was involved. If new studies should be done, they should be conducted as far as possible from the STURP approach. The STURP members payed most of their campaign of research by themselves. I am not sure that someone did actually receive a salary. In this way, one does not select the best scientists, but just those who strongly believe in the “mystery”. People who finance the research should be distinct from the scientists actually operating. A committee should raise the money. Conflicts of interest should be avoided as much as possible. The committee should select scientists who can present a scientifically sound research project, possibly not anymore regarding datation (since this is one of the few sure aspect). This project should be evaluated together with the scientist CV (expertise, education, scientific achievements etc). Radiocarbon can be repeated since it will not require much material as the one in 1988, and the new analysis can restrict the data range. Actually, the idea of Rogers to perform it on the charred material is a good one.

He did not mention these foreign peaks due to the contamination in his discussion of the spectra. Moreover indicated that the peak at M=96 was due to furfural, while it is clear that it is instead due to the contaminant.
