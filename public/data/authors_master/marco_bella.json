First, when he thought that there were oligomers from polyethylene, and second when he thought that the two samples were different.

No other part of the shroud shows such a coating. The early thermal evolution of furfural during pyrolysis/ms analyses, the relatively easy water solubility, the yellow color formed with iodine, and the easy hydrolysis suggest gum Arabic. Gum Arabic is obtained from Acacia senegal and is composed of pentose-sugar units. Its presence as a major component in the coatings on the Raes and radiocarbon samples is not a surprise, because it has long been a common vehicle in tempera paints. The radiocarbon sample had been dyed. Dyeing was probably done intentionally on pristine replacement material to match the color of the older, sepia-colored cloth…\n————–\nSo, the presence of Arabic gum is “suggested” by:\n1)“thermal evolution of furfural [peak at M=96] during pyrolysis”> the peak at M=96 belongs to the cluster of the contaminant and, as said many times, could be many different things. A single peak in mass spectrometry is not enough to confirm anything.\n2)“Relatively easily [relatively respect to what?] water solubility”, you tell me which significance that has. Millions of substance dissolve in water, starting from salt and sugar.\n3)“yellow color formed with iodine” Millions of compounds form a yellow color with iodine, therefore it is used in most chemistry laboratories around the world to stain the TLC spots.\nYou tell me how reliable this identification is. \nYou also wrote:\n———–\n>On the other hand, the spectrum is not very far from >what Rogers concluded, in particular, furfural [the >peak at M=96] appears present in that spectrum and >the intensity at m/z 126 is negligible.\n———-\nPlease refer again to the “pink dragon argument” illustrated above.

Furthermore, C14 samples are cleaned with organic solvents before the C14 determination, and the traces of thymol would be removed anyway. Actually, the late Ray Rogers also said (this time correctly) that a new C14 analysis could be performed using the charred material from the  1532 fire removed during restauration of 2002, since fire does not alter the ratio between carbon isotopes.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2015 at 3:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/25/finally-an-explanation-for-the-exclamation-mark/","cat":"lectures","title":"Finally, An Explanation for the Exclamation Mark!"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"Since it appears you really like the subject:\nhttp://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/04/13/sindone-quando-la-storia-puo-essere-rigorosa-quanto-la-scienza/1584100/\nPS please do not use google translator.

It is difficult to understand mass spectra. With pyrolysis mass spectra you warm up a sample, chemical compounds are broken down, you see only some fragments. You have to solve a complex puzzle, sometimes without all the pieces. It might be feasible if you have one or two compounds, but with several molecules hardly any conclusion can be drawn. \nConsider that pyrolysis mass spectra was a technique used in the eighties. Do you remember the technology at that time? How computers and mobile phones looked like?\nToday, mass spectrometry has completely different instrumentation, and can give totally different information. With those spectra done in the eighties, we can just conclude that one is contaminated with a compound bearing a long aliphatic chain and besides that, they are the same.\nI tried to answer to all your concerns in this forum because it might be useful also for others, but if you need additional information for your article, please feel free to contact me.\n\n","date":"September 22, 2015 at 3:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"——————-\nWhy did I not pay more attention when the paper was included in the Proceedings of the International Workshop on the Scientific approach to the Acheiropoietos Images in Frascati in 2010?\n—————–\nMaybe because the lyric singer Giovanna De Liso is more known for telling about her experiences of “alien abduction” and her photos of UFO.\nSorry: only Italian\n——–\n\nhttp://oggiscienza.it/2012/10/01/alieni-energia-piezonucleare-e-fusione-fredda/\n\n","date":"November 13, 2015 at 4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/13/nevertheless-the-images-are-real-enough/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nevertheless, the images are real enough!"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"I am surely not denigrating anyone!\nI enjoy classic music and I believe that Giovanna De Liso is a good singer.

Highest costs in the STURP examination of 1978 should have probably been logistic and instrumentation. However, today we can get much more information with a fraction of that money. Just imagine how computers and cell phones (!!) looked in the eighties. A smartphone of today probably cost much less of the biggest computer available at that time and it is much more powerful. The same is true for scientific apparatus. \nThe mass spectrometer reported in Rogers’ papers was at that time a state-of-the-art apparatus, but today it is a technological fossil. With tiny amounts of sample a lot of questions can be answered. \nWhat is really needed is few reliable people who collect the samples and distribute to the selected laboratories. I believe that it should be relatively easy to find private sponsors and we are not looking to huge amounts.\nReal issues for new tests are not scientific, technological or financial, but human (get permission from Vatican; select trustable scientists; avoid “McCrone”-like cases, in which someone that says something “undesired” is out of the project, and so on).\n\n","date":"October 10, 2015 at 12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/09/no-closer-to-the-truth-because-of-simony/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"No Closer to the Truth Because of Simony"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"Not that it really matters, but I understand that Gonnella made a survey of STURP team members’  religious beliefs.

If new studies should be done, they should be conducted as far as possible from the STURP approach. The STURP members payed most of their campaign of research by themselves. I am not sure that someone did actually receive a salary. In this way, one does not select the best scientists, but just those who strongly believe in the “mystery”. People who finance the research should be distinct from the scientists actually operating. A committee should raise the money. Conflicts of interest should be avoided as much as possible. The committee should select scientists who can present a scientifically sound research project, possibly not anymore regarding datation (since this is one of the few sure aspect). This project should be evaluated together with the scientist CV (expertise, education, scientific achievements etc). Radiocarbon can be repeated since it will not require much material as the one in 1988, and the new analysis can restrict the data range. Actually, the idea of Rogers to perform it on the charred material is a good one. Except from C14, I believe that the analysis should be decided by the scientists, not the people raising the money.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2015 at 4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/09/no-closer-to-the-truth-because-of-simony/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"No Closer to the Truth Because of Simony"}],"resources":[{"author":"marco_bella","post":"Sorry.\n…actually, we do not need to GO that far…\n\n","date":"September 12, 2015 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/09/significant-response-to-the-preview-of-the-thermochimica-acta-editorial/","cat":"article","title":"Significant Response to the Preview of the Thermochimica Acta Editorial"},{"author":"marco_bella","post":"Piero wrote:\n————\n… we have to know what is the probable compound of for that alkyl chain…\n———–\nActually, we do not need to do that far… we just need to read what Rogers wrote in his paper.\n———–\n“…The chemical-ionization system used was the most sensitive MS at the time, sufficiently sensitive to detect parts per-billion traces of oligomers from the polyethylene bag that Gonella had used to wrap the Raes threads…”\n————\nIt happens that “oligomers from polyethylene” show a spectra which peaks differ by 14 atomic mass units.
