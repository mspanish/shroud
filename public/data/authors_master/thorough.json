{"dating":[{"author":"thorough","post":"You (the original author), don’t know too much about scientific method, nor for that matter know how to post an unbiased piece relating to the SOT.\nFor starters, Roger’s findings relate purely and specifically to the samples taken in the 1970’s Rae’s and NOT the actually 1988 RIGGI samples, used for the c-14 dating. \nThat however does not stop you from claiming Roger’s got his “findings” in the c-14 sample. (WHICH HE DIDN’T)\nSecondly, Ball’s commentary in Nature, is an opinion piece and not an independent evaluation of Roger’s work ON the Rae’s piece, which again is a different sample to the RIGGI one.\nBrown also did not do what could be called independent testing and even on the PDF found at the shroud.com site, states clearly in his PDF that at the time of the printing, his own analysis had not reached a conclusion.\nVillareal’s comments were too a conference paper, aimed specifically at shroud supporters and as his findings have yet to be published, how can YOU Mr “author” determine what his “findings” actaully stated?\nThe most laughable part of your content was your assertion that Chris Ramsey is shown to back up your feeble tale. You did neglect to mention from his work that:\n“As yet there is no direct evidence for this – or indeed any direct evidence to suggest the original radiocarbon dates are not accurate.”\nThe above is directly from \nhttp://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/embed.php?File=shroud.html\nIt is amazing that you are putting words into the mouths of people not actually having said what you claim they have and ignoring things they HAVE ACTUALLY said. \nObviously, it is a case of in reference to you YE OF LITTLE FAITH.\n\n","date":"May 5, 2009 at 10:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/09/21/the-big-carbon-dated-mistake-shroud-of-turin-and-the-scientific-quest-for-god/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Big Carbon Dated Mistake: Shroud of Turin and the Scientific Quest for God"}]}
