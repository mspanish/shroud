I’ve just been watching a ‘documentary’ that promotes this idea,and by the end wanted to hurl things at the screen.They kept saying Leonardo’s face was a ‘perfect match’ for the face on the shroud which to my eyes was absolute bullshit.Add to the fact that  there exists a letter by a priest during the  medieval period that the shroud was fake and that he had located the artist leads me to cry,”Uncle!”.They like the theory because it’s sexy and novel and gets people who have no interest in the often tedious and confusing  archeological sciences interested in what they have to say.I knew I couldn’t be the only one who knew the whole theory was dodgy.Thank you!","date":"September 23, 2010 at 8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/10/21/the-ridiculous-picknett-and-prince-photograph-theory/","cat":"history","title":"The Ridiculous Picknett and Prince Photograph Theory"}]}
