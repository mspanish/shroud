And if you were trying to pass on a secret message why do it in this Hungarian manuscript? What is extraordinary is that anyone ever believed this idea in the first place: Christ is being shown buried according to the custom of the twelfth century, he has no beard, the Shroud is too small for the Turin Shroud, there is no image on the Shroud in the Two Marys picture, It seems that there is a separate face cloth as in other pictures of the time, the pattern on the tomb lid is not weaving and there is no reason why the way the cloth was woven should be venerated, any more than the holes in the Shroud.

These are all well documented and the crowds followed them. No crowds are reported for any shroud. The most important Shroud was at Cadouin where the abbey grew rich from the pilgrims visiting it.

In addition Charles seems to argue that it would have been impossible to have dyed fibres of cotton or cotton that was bonded with linen as Thibault claims it was.So Rogers was wrong to call the added material he found a dye because it is impossible to imagine a scenario where cotton would have needed to have been dyed.

Do you know of any others as it is important we have all the known examples to work from?2) In the Acts the word is only used to describe the sindon ( a normal name for a linen cloth) BEFORE Jesus wiped his face with it. In other words a cloth was brought that was tetradiplon ,and THEN given to Jesus. The word tetradiplon is, so far as I know not used otherwise.So how does Wilson deal with this?P. 190. 2010 edition of The Shroud.‘Although its initially off-putting aspect [of the Acts] is that it ‘explains’ the creation of the Image as by Jesus washing himself, it intriguingly GOES ON [my capitals] to describe the cloth on which the Image was imprinted as tetradiplon’.Now by using ‘goes on’ Wilson implies that tetradiplon is used of the cloth AFTER the image is on it, instead of BEFORE as the Acts make clear. Is he simply being imprecise or is he deliberately misleading? Please let us know what you think.He is misleadng on sindon. Look up any traditional Greek lexicon, e.g. Lddell and Scott and you will find the word probably originated as cloth from India but then became a generic term for fine linen or just linen. So forget any connection with burial shrouds from the gospels, this is simply a linen cloth being brought to Jesus for him to wipe his image on.Wilson also makes great play about a four folded cloth having to be large- nonsense- if you have a pocket handkerchief you will see that during ironing, if you do such thngs, it is folded over four times. (Sometimes being the family ironer pays off!) So size has nothing to do with it.As Yannick suggests this makes Jackson’s folding irrelevant  to the issue.Read on in the Acts and there is a separate reference to the crucifixion and burial of Jesus with the burial cloths described in the same Acts as being LEFT in the tomb. (This would not,of course, stop them from being gathered from there and becoming what is now the Turin Shroud.)So it is up to you to provide any reason why these burial cloths should be tetradiplon. Contrary to what Wilson argues it is the ACTs temsleves, the very document he uses, that destroys his own argument about tetradiplon. By using ‘goes on’ you could say he is being misleading by misrepresenting the order of events as set out in the Acts and so creating an argument that has never existed.This is why Yannick feels so strongly about these things- it only needs a little,bit of research, and Yannick has done a lot to see how quickly much of what Wilson writes collapses when the original sources are consulted.","date":"July 14, 2012 at 7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"author":"lyfe","post":"Please help as I am confused.An ordinary handkerchief that one takes out of a drawer is folded four times so tetradiplon cloth does not have to be large.In the only reference to tetradiplon I can find (the Acts of Thaddeus) tetradiplon describes the cloth BEFORE Christ wipes his face with it so it can’t be the Turin Shroud.

Faced with examples of Vignon markings, from catacomb art, of the fourth century, Jones, at the end of the comments postings,  suggested that the Shroud was copied in Antioch in the fourth century. (Stephen Jones prefers the Markwardt’s Antioch theory over Wilson’s Edessa theory for the early hiding of the Shroud.)The presence of Vignon markings in earlier Christian and imperial art has always been a problem for Wilson’s theory of the copying of the Shroud in the sixth century.I was amazed how limited Vignon’s examination of the Shroud was- an hour with a group of others at midnight and ten minutes in the open air when there was a crowd around it-not much time for a scholarly assessment!","date":"September 29, 2012 at 3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman"}],"resources":[{"author":"lyfe","post":"I am not sure how radiation ever got into it in the first place.

He says that he now knows what would be required to do so and it seems beyond the bounds of possibility. So might it be that we can call it a day for radiation as a cause of the image?  If so this would be scientifically important.2) Some people talk as if the images were caused by the Resurrection but the images are not of Christ going through a Resurrection-they are pre-Resurrection images.3) If there is human blood on the Shroud, where does this fit in with the images, radiated or otherwise? What is the best thinking of when the blood came onto the Shroud, before or after the images? obviously the blood cannot be the result of radiation so how can it be separated out from the rest?4) Where does the funding for all this work come from? it seems to have taken up a lot of resources at a prestigious laboratory- or perhaps it is after hours work.","date":"August 13, 2015 at 8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/11/tantalizingly-close-enough/","cat":"article","title":"Tantalizingly Close Enough?"},{"author":"lyfe","post":"Thanks, Hugh and Louis. It will be interesting to follow up more on Dr.Lazzaro. Not sure I am up to church politics on this one though. What does Di Lazzaro want to do that the Church does not want him to do? Can’t he just get on with his experiments even if they haven’t created anything positive  so far- they don’t seem to need access to the Shroud itself. Will need to get on with the reading to find out.If the apostle Paul is right, that the Resurrection was the transformation of Christ’s physical body into a spiritual body, then the Shroud does not show that but something before that. So I presume the images could not have been from a source of  energy created by the body as it was being changed into a spiritual form as they would not have come out in the static form we have now. They would have shown something of the life that the apostles saw.Will get reading. Thanks for the suggestions.","date":"August 13, 2015 at 2:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/11/tantalizingly-close-enough/","cat":"article","title":"Tantalizingly Close Enough?"}]}
