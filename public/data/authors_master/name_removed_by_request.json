{"opinion":[{"author":"name_removed_by_request","post":"Im AB negative and it has been confirmed twice by two different institutions. i never thought much of it until recently when i was worried about the possibility of dying if i get pregnant with a RH positive child. i just stumbled across this. now the strange thing with me  is my mother claims she is O- and my father is B+, that makes me impossible. So who knows maybe i am not the product of my father (and that is quite possible) or my mother is lying about her blood type (also quite possible, too feel cool about being O-, ie the universal donor) or my father is actually AB-. who knows. regardless. I am part German and my last name seems to be the equivalent of the Jewish name for Jacob (which happens to be Joachim, or Mary’s fathers last name)\ni have always had psychic abilities, i have stalked by a occult before, im naturally immune to some viruses very common in the population and i have had some other strange mystical experiences.\nNow for all that i have experienced in life and it has been a lot. IM A very level headed person and i KNOW for a fact that divinity exists here on earth but i just shalk it up to some of being more enlightened than others due to our strength during struggles and the choices we have made. Look at the Catholic saints.   not saying i am a saint because in many ways i am not but damn it there is something strange about me. the funny part, i really wouldnt care if anyone else thought i was special. im not one of those assholes who charges 100$ for yoga class to shove some bs of some peoples ass and have people worship me because i am “enlightened”. i know too many people like that and they have always made me want to puke and i have always been very unimpressed. still, i just want the man i love to recognize my gifts and support them. because a conservative Catholic, im not sure if thats going to happen.\nOWELL, now of days. one has to cut ones losses and look at the person holistically. i will never find the perfect man and it is going to take lots for me to tolerate the ones  i have had , but im looking for the holistically best man. im sure ill never been thrilled and ill never truly be recognized but whatever, c est la vie.\nif you guys find out more, let me know. super curious.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2012 at 11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"}]}
