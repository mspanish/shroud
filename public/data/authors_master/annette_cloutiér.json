Still, When I say the wounds can be reproduced by painting, I mean they are fairly easy to simulate using paint, blood or a mixture, although until what they were actually made of is established, it will be impossible to replicate their chemistry. It was their shapes I was thinking of. Much to most people’s surprise, we have very little idea of what a Roman flagrum (or flagellum) looked like. None have ever been found, and there are a few illustrations on coins and the like, all different. It was obviously some kind of thonged whip, but how many thongs or tips, and what the tips might have been made of, is anyone’s guess (see Mel Gibson’s Passion film). It may be that the marks on the shroud exactly match a Roman flagrum, or it may be that a painter just came up with a good idea. The two designs of Roman flagrum that copies have often been made of and photographed were based specifically on measurements made of the Shroud itself, and do not even resemble the ancient illustrations. Much to most people’s surprise, we have no idea whether people were nailed through the palms, hands or lower arms. Although elaborate demonstrations with real corpses have shown how a hanging body would be too heavy for a dead weight on the arms, many Roman descriptions mention a sedile or seat, sometimes described as a horn sticking out, on which the victim sat, removing all the weight from his arms altogether. It may be that the nails through the wrists thing exactly match a Roman crucifixion, or it may be that a painter just thought it might be a good idea (perhaps he experimented on corpses too!). Much to people’s surprise, blood does not trickle down the outside of hair. It oozes out from the scalp and mats it into a bloody mass. Google news pictures of terrorists bombs for confirmation. To be fair, some people have supposed that the blood flows down the side of the face were imprinted on the shroud from the cheeks, whereafter the shroud realigned itself horizontally to receive the image of the hair, which was thus out of register with the blood flows. However this does not account for the trickles which appear at the back of the head. Much to people’s surprise, blood does not zigzag out of a stab wound to the chest, it flows straight down. To be fair, some people have surmised that the bloodflow from the chest occurred after the body had been taken down from the cross and the original blood had been washed off, and stained the cloth as the body was wrapped or draped with it. This is quite a reasonable scenario. You mentioned earlier that the wounds could not be “drawn in by any genius artist to match in 3 D information and negative quality.” All the blood flows are now fairly uniform pinkish stains, and do not display any particularly interesting features in terms of any relationship between their colour intensity and distance, which is the basis of the 3 D effect, or in terms of their negativity (they just turn green). Delighted to be of assistance! You’re right! I was much surprised! What’s the 10% your giving to the Image having been formed to? (Something like an alien communication from a parallel Universe? Something which may have formed the Image on Guadalupe or Manoppello?).","date":"2014-01-25","mins":"3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"id":"comment-74713","author":"annette_cloutiér","post":"Does anyone know what ever became of the cutaway seam in the C14 area taken by Riggi in 1988?

I am “skeptical” about the testimony in the NT because the Stories are “contrived” they are an announcement and EVANGALION of the New Universal Lord written nearly a half century after the life of Our Lord. I think the NT served its purpose in creating a great energy for life in the economic efficiency of equality of SPIRIT… with Good Information told in Story of the Father delegating the work to the Son and the Son delegating the work to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit delegating the work to everyone of us equally as kings and queens who know how love can grow. So far I’ve seen very little of this obvious work that needs to be undertaken with the greatest passion in raising the dignity of one another by sincerely caring for one another–for enabling one another to be royal in love. I think the NT is a gold mine for all of us to claim a stake in the nobility of Christ… but I see that for many of us the gold mine has been used in making trinkets of jewelry. Going beyond the NT there are waves and more waves of information that could provide the Economy of Spirit via the work of equality so that no one need ever be Crucified again for the sake of Resurrection..","date":"2014-02-12","mins":"1:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"id":"comment-78715","author":"annette_cloutiér","post":"Louis you’re right… Like Hugh with the Shroud’s authenticity, I straddle the fence with the authenticity of the NT, especially the 4 Gospels.

The apostles, including Paul, would have to taken it around while they were preaching, particularly about the Resurrection, but they didn’t do so. Louis, so sorry… I didn’t see your Quote ’til now. Well yes I do believe that the Shroud instigated Paul to writing about his Platonic Jesus then mystically becoming Christ and Mark to writing in order to bring Jesus back down to earth while leaving Paul’s mysticism intact. John Loken first wrote in his book (2010): The Shroud was the Resurrection, after which a few years later (2012) Thomas de Wesselow also concurred. The NT Biblical scholarship in both books was only a preliminary one: Loken’s out of his own logic and reasoning… de Wesselow from an art historian point of view. The Gospels are stories written decades after the time of Jesus. I am quite certain that a certain few first century devotees were allowed to see the Shroud in all its glory: a long snow white sheet with a young crucified golden man staring with bright red blood crying out in supplication… It was the Shroud that gave rise to Christianity not the Gospels itself.

Within the community of monks they usually act stupid/mentally retarded or dumb to avoid glorification by other monks. They are extremely humble and wear dirty rags. They are usually discovered by accident ( bright light coming out of their dwellings at night, sounds of people praying together where there is only one person in a room, situations where someone showed up in a place far away from where he lives with no explanation how he got there etc.) these people intentionally avoid detection so I think it’s almost impossible to get evidence for this. They get the energy from the word of God. The father of Monasticism “Abba Antonious” was a very rich man and he heard the bible read in church, the verse where Jesus told the rich man “if you want to be perfect sell what you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” He took that verse personally and followed the commandment and started Monasticism in the whole world. So the energy is in the word of God, but how many people are willing to follow through? Hi Mike… Speaking of Anthony the Great… the rich young man who started desert monasticism ca 285, I read somewhere he wasn’t as saintly as you make him out to be… he had a pedophiliac relationship with Athanasius of Alexandria (the monk who authorized the canonization of the NT). Athanasius was no prize either… he had a wicked temper. So I don’t know about relying on past information. How can we be sure of anything really… we can’t test it empirically. But today, in our Information Age, we ought to be able to take pictures, videos, and create documentaries of these phenomenon. Just like we do of deep sea creatures of the ocean which are seldom seen (e.g., giant squid), we should be able to make a documentary of the Rainbow Body Phenomenon..","date":"2014-02-14","mins":"8:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/13/what-things-would-not-be-known-until-800-years-into-the-future/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What things would not be known until 800 years into the future?"},{"id":"comment-79341","author":"annette_cloutiér","post":"Right Hugh, I’ve seen on the Discovery Channel the filming of Tibetan Monks in the frigid cold wearing only a wet towel across their backs while in group meditation…one by one the towels on their backs would become steamy hot… I’ve looked for that on the Net (You Tube, Discovery Channel, etc.) and couldn’t find it. But I found other research such as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl Jnl B4 Tgu0 and http://www.discovery.com/tv shows/discovery presents/videos/the supernaturalist levitation.htm. I think dispelling the authenticity of this type of phenomenon would be akin to dispelling the authenticity of the Shroud… while not quite associated to a Medieval Merlin work, there is something almost unrelatable to be said for those who dedicate their lives totally in the deepest wells of E=MC2. I would like to see more authentication of this type of spiritual field.

It was from a faint memory. I felt rather uncomfortable blogging about it. I quickly checked Wikipedia on the life of Athanasius. This is what I found: Sozomen speaks of his “fitness for the priesthood”, and calls attention to the significant circumstance that he was “from his tenderest years practically self taught”. “Not long after this,” adds the same authority, Bishop Alexander “invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen” (Soz., II, xvii). That “wisdom and acumen” manifested themselves in a varied environment. While still a deacon under Alexander’s care, he seems to have been brought for a while into close relations with some of the solitaries of the Egyptian desert, and in particular with the Anthony the Great, whose life he is said to have written. So now I’m unsure as to weather it was Bishop Alexander or Anthony the Great who toyed with Athanasius. But I remember doing research on this nearly 10 years ago… so I will have to retrace my steps further..","date":"2014-02-14","mins":"4:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/13/what-things-would-not-be-known-until-800-years-into-the-future/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What things would not be known until 800 years into the future?"},{"id":"comment-79563","author":"annette_cloutiér","post":"Mike, this is precisely my point.

I’m just saying that there are certain things that we can not know for sure. The Shroud, being in our time and space right now, should be something that the Church should not leave as mystery because we can study it here and now. It should be universally studied for the betterment of science, religion, or whatever it is that moves us to a greater good. It’s lovely thinking that Anthony the Great and the Desert Fathers were “holy”. It’s good for the mind, I’m sure, to contemplate the sacrifice of the smaller self, but for God’s sake we need to see and appreciate to the fullest the sacrifice others are making towards the study of the reality of Christ… Those dedicated now to the Shroud should be given more universal support. The Shroud after all is the indelible and long lasting sign of his Energy, his Mass, his Light. Whether it’s through the study of the Shroud itself, or the study of other spiritual phenomenon… such as Rainbow Bodies, the good that can result is a greater reality and idea of The Holy..","date":"2014-02-15","mins":"8:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/13/what-things-would-not-be-known-until-800-years-into-the-future/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What things would not be known until 800 years into the future?"},{"id":"comment-79012","author":"annette_cloutiér","post":"Tom, this was extremely helpful.
