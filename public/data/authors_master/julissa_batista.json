Always believed in god but this year something different happened to me making me feel closer to God. I decided to see for first time The Passion of the Christ by Mel Gibson and actor Jim caviezel on good Friday, short after I decided to read the book “Heaven is for real “and then looking for videos and songs thru the net was when I realized how exactly this actor representing Jesus looks exactly like “the Prince of Peace- Jesus” by Akiane.. It felt like if the movie was directed by Jesus himself.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2012 at 2:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
