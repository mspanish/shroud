I myself am an atheist, so I have no axe to grind other than wishing for an open minded, scientific and empirical approach to the problem. You warn against mistrusting fellow scientists, and you may well be wise to do so, but your Point 7 (“The body image would have to be imprinted first, so as to know where to apply the blood”) flatly contradicts Heller and Adler, who are quoted as saying in the Canadian Society of Forensic Science Journal (1981) that the image colour does NOT appear under the bloodstains when the bloodstains are removed with a proteolytic enzyme. I take this to mean that the blood must have “coloured” the linen BEFORE the body image was created. Are you refuting Heller and Adler’s statement? If so, it would be interesting to know on what grounds. “Take nobody’s word for it” is a fine starting point, but supposing they’re right?.","date":"2015-05-16","mins":"3:23 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/modelling-the-turin-shroud-forged-in-the-14th-century-as-a-white-flour-imprint-onto-linen-then-chemically-developed-with-nitric-acid-to-resemble-ancient-yellowed-sweat/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Modelling the Turin Shroud: forged in the 14th century as a white flour imprint onto linen?

As I understand it (as a non scientist), the core of your idea is a two stage process of image formation, analagous to pre digital photography: (a) taking the photo; (b) developing it as a negative. The blood is added between the two stages. The blood, of course, is a bridge that will have to be crossed later. It’s interesting to note Adler’s comments about the blood (referenced in Kearse’s “Immunological Review”, 2012: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/kearse.pdf). I like the way you work. You are right to challenge suggestions of supernatural involvement by attempting to reproduce image formation in this manner. It always worries me when I hear someone say, as scientists, journalists and mystics often do: “THAT can’t possibly have happened”. If you succeed in developing a putative image formation technique which could have been executed by anyone in the 13th/14th century, you will have disproved the “can’t possibly have happened” normative statement, which would be a significant step forward in TS research..","date":"2015-05-16","mins":"12:57 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/modelling-the-turin-shroud-forged-in-the-14th-century-as-a-white-flour-imprint-onto-linen-then-chemically-developed-with-nitric-acid-to-resemble-ancient-yellowed-sweat/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Modelling the Turin Shroud: forged in the 14th century as a white flour imprint onto linen?
