I was agnostic/atheist prior to the accident, yet have since known without doubt the Divine realm exists and it launched me on a spiritual path. While I have not read Colton’s book, I have seen his interviews and scanned the book at the store, and fully believe all that he experienced and described as true. \nI purchased both of Akiane’s paintings of Jesus for my home. It does not concern me if they represent *exactly* how Jesus looked when he walked the Earth 2000 years ago. I believe the Bible even says that when Jesus re-appeared following his “death” that he looked different each time, such that His disciples and Mary Magdalene did not recognize him?  Since God lives, breathes, and assumes all forms of life in the Universe, what I see when I look at these images is simply the amazingly kind, patient, sweet, inspirational, and beautiful face of God. \nLove! ♥\n\n","date":"August 18, 2011 at 8:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"michele","post":"Do we believe God comprises all of these things?\nhttp://christianity.about.com/od/biblefactsandlists/qt/biblefactsgod.htm\nHow can we accept God as Love, Light, Peace, alive, omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient AND exclusive, distant, divisive, judgmental, spiteful, and downright cruel?  \nGod is Love.

I am someone who found this site as I have the two paintings of Jesus by Akiane Kramarik and I also had a near-death experience. Somehow I think we are closer in our love of God than you think. And I truly admire your choice to be a passionate advocate for God :)  \nThis forum is obviously not optimal for a conversation like this, but just to briefly respond to your latest note in this thread ..  \nPersonally experiencing God does not result in “interpretation” of Truth as that is not the way of God. God IS faithful, gracious, and unchanging, not misleading or capricious. Although interpreting the words of God in the Bible, or any other text or thought, without direct conversation with God does result in infinite interpretations! \nAlso, God is neither passive nor distant as many believe, and spans all of the religions, philosophies, and sciences of this world. The amazing beauty of God is everywhere, yet historically, most of us have been unable to see this. Jesus happened to be one of the few human beings who walked this world as God without any veils. \nWhile we are “in” this world, we are advised in the Bible to not be “of” this world. Who knows what this really means? I personally had no idea until God began revealing its meaning. And believe me, the reality of God is beyond our wildest dreams. Nothing of this world is what we ‘think’.\nAnyway, you, and others here, may be interested in an infomentary called “The Star of Bethlehem” as well as the accounts documented in this film: http://bit.ly/oz8L1o . They provide further expansions to our notions of God, from the Christian perspective, and I hope they bring further enlightenment, or at minimum, greatly add to the mystery ;) \nMy deepest prayer is for all to experience who they really are. Until then, Mark 12:28-34. \nIn love and gratitude ♥\n\n","date":"November 24, 2011 at 5:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"michele","post":"Michelle, I can relate to much of what you describe about your life and had that same thought (why did I come back?). My experiences included disfigurement and impairments from childhood injuries, uninvolved parents, dysfunctional relationships and abusive marriage, and a near-fatal accident resulting in amnesia, brain injury, and long-term cognitive, nervous system, and structural damage. I did have “near-death experiences” with the last injury, yet seeing beyond the physical impairments was very difficult. At 40, I too felt 100 — alone, successful career terminated overnight, extremely frail and weak with little understanding about why I returned and what this (seemingly) crazy life here was even about. \nAfter seeking healing from nearly every traditional, alternative, and spiritual treatment possible, God graciously began revealing to me what true healing, and life, is about. And suffice to say, what is being revealed is far and away beyond anything I could have ever imagined. \nThe best advice I could offer is to continue trusting your truth, and go deeper within yourself for all the answers you seek. Massive shifts in our world and human consciousness have been happening for the past few decades and God is revealing to EVERY one right now. And while many share similarities in experiences and resonate with similar messages, each of our paths to Truth are unique. As you are already sensing, if/when you experience Truth, you will definitely know it beyond any doubt. Love .. Thy Will Be Done  ♥\n\n","date":"December 2, 2011 at 2:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"michele","post":"Michelle, my heart SO goes out to you right now. Independent of purpose, the perceptions I held of my former “hard” life story have completely shifted, and I pray that very soon you too will shift from feeling you are “trudging forward” to feeling like you are dancing! \nThe great news is, absolutely nothing is “wrong”. We are all being perfectly guided and we have never, ever been alone. While the words in Footprints in the Sand imply there could be two sets of footprints, that is not the case. We are never separate from Love, from when we arrive to when we depart, and perceiving the time in between as a special and unique adventure can be most helpful!\nLove ♥\n\n","date":"December 3, 2011 at 3:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}],"opinion":[{"author":"michele","post":"I’m the silly Michelle quoted, and thanks Annie for trying to decipher my silliness. \nWhen I said, my brother has female blood, I should have said CHROMOSOMES, as in xx, not related to the blood type neg. \nMy brother now produces my blood. He was sent for comprehensive testing, and they did a chromosone study, which showed he had female chromosones, but, the lab report said, ”male”… so, they kept faxing the doctor asking for the right patient, since, they were unable to process this report, since it showed a female, not a male.\nWhen they found out he was a blood marrow recipient, they were all surprised. Even they never saw that before. THAT was the source for our original discussion,\ni have to add that my brother is very antichristian, and has always been antagonistic towards my conversion. When he was getting his transfusion of my harvested bone marrow, everyone teased him that he would become me. So, they gave him a Bible and a LED ZEPPELIN CD.  \nIt was my way of trying to appeal to his vanity, when I tried to convince him that he was like Jesus, if our blood was related, because, like Jesus, he only had a female set of chromosomes in his blood, since Jesus had no human father.\nI didn’t mean to offend anyone, or imply we are Merovingians, or royalty, however, I have been extensively genetically tested, because, in addition to having ABneg blood, I was born with a rare disorder. I even was sent to the Mayo clinic, who were doing research, and they said I showed a genetic trait common in European and Russian royalty. I told them that was unlikely, knowing my relatives were common peasants, Jewish peasants, at that.\nIt’s very fascinating to me these stories of reptiles, and aliens, etc. Since my blood has sometimes been flawed enough to make me vulnerable to ailments, and ironically strong enough to save my brother’s life, it is a topic that makes me say foolish things, or maybe they’re wise… who’s to say… we all have a certain vanity, and hope that we’re special.\nI DON’T feel special, so, that’s something that probably is overcompensated for, by my tangeantial romps into these things. It’s nothing that serious in my life, but, I have gotten more people contacting me over this one blog post than everything else I’ve ever written.\nThanks, i think, for the interest, and repost.  I am happy if I made people smile, or laugh, or think about things.\nTake care..  ,\n\n","date":"November 24, 2013 at 10:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"},{"author":"michele","post":"No, no, not female blood type… female chromosomes.
