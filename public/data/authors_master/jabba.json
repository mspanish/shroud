Currently, and customarily, participants drop the wine into saucers, but I think that Rebecca says, or implies, that 2000 years ago, the participants would have simply dropped the wine on the table — or table cloth. – Then, I’m thinking that even if table cloths were not traditional back in those days, there are at least two possible reasons for a cloth covering the table of the Last Supper. Maybe 1) They were used for Seders in general so as to catch the wine. And/or 2) This cloth was a Pharisaic Sacerdotal garment worn by a high priest (as suggested by Adrie — a follower of this blog — at http://www.jesusking.info/John%20 Mark.pdf) and, for one reason or another, used for this special occasion.

But then, for what it’s worth… – I tend to think that a corona discharge type of event accounts for the image better than does any other explanation (though, I need to study that further). – And then, while I wouldn’t be surprised if the image is the product of totally “natural” events, neither would I be surprised if at least part of the image formation is what we would call “supernatural.” Though also, I halfway suspect that what we currently call “supernatural” (ESP, Precognition, etc.) is just not currently understood, and will someday be considered quite “natural” — quantum mechanics may be pointing the way. – But also, I doubt that “faith” needs to be blind. In fact, I suspect that it should NOT be TOTALLY blind. (Not to dismiss their claims out of hand, but if blind faith were all that were needed, we could easily be tied into the Quran, or The Book of Mormon, instead of the Bible.) I sort of suspect that faith always requires something of a “leap,” but some of us can leap further than can others of us. For me, being a short leaper, the Shroud (whether natural, or supernatural) has been of significant help. I am “naturally” drawn to the other side, and since I began seriously studying the Shroud, my possibility of actually making that crossing has grown by LEAPS AND BOUNDS. (Trying to be cute, that last sentence was stretching a little, but the Shroud does seem to have added significantly to my suspicion that Jesus really was the prophesied Jewish Messiah.) – You’ve gotta admit — this is exciting stuff!.","date":"2011-08-31","mins":"9:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/30/the-ron-and-yannick-shroud-of-turin-image-discussion/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Ron and Yannick Shroud of Turin Image Discussion"},{"id":"comment-2408","author":"jabba","post":"– It seems to me that 1.

It is the “INDIRECT” evidence that causes the analytic reader to insist that the Shroud is fake. 4. (Ironically enough, analytic readers tend to place too much FAITH in Sherlock Holmes. They believe that they have “eliminated the impossible” (the supernatural), and consequently believe that we are stuck with fakery — “however improbable” such a conclusion is, given the DIRECT evidence.

And, 2) Controversial issues tend to be “exponential.” – Put these together and we humans are almost always given to going in circles when debating. – (I’ve written several (unpublished) treatises on this problem. To see one of them, you can go to http://messiahornot.com/Treatise.php.) – Luckily, I think that we can ignore the first problem for now, and focus exclusively on how to deal with the complexity of our controversies. – By “exponential,” I’m referring to the tendency for 1) The basic controversial issue to have multiple sub issues. For, 2) Each sub issue to have multiple sub sub issues. And, 3) Etc. – And then, human reflexes simply were not designed to deal with this complexity. – Once into a debate, we “zone out” and slip into a fight/flight mode, where our awareness and objectivity go to Hell.

A little late, but better than never. Back on 2/7/11, I claimed on your blog that I had a way to expose (to the world) the “wrongheadedness” of the notable detractors of the Shroud — and that such would be a very good thing. I went on to say that I would happily explain my approach if anyone was interested… You were the only one interested, but clearly that was plenty, so I wrote back trying to explain. You didn’t respond, so I figured that you weren’t particularly impressed, but that you were too kind, and busy, to explicitly say so. Or maybe, you just don’t have time to personally read all your email… In truth, you’ve always been especially rational and friendly, so I figured that I just wouldn’t bother you for awhile. But then, I have continued to think about what seems to me an excellent opportunity for helping people with their Christian faith. (I don’t think that faith needs to be blind.) And, while showing up the skeptics to the world wouldn’t necessarily prove anything, it would surely help. So anyway, my approach was to challenge any, and all, notable detractors of the Shroud to a public (on line) written debate. I figured that our side would surely win an EFFECTIVE debate — and most importantly, that I KNEW HOW TO HOLD SUCH A DEBATE. And the first step in developing such debate would be putting it into writing. So anyway, I think that we (you, with us fans helping) should accept a debate, but not in an oral format. You should tell your adversaries that you would WELCOME a live, on line, debate, but that it has to be in writing — as, ORAL debates tend to be little more than side shows… I’ll try again to lay out the parameters of my alleged solution in a minimal way, and put it on this blog. If I can’t abstract it sufficiently, I’ll send my best effort by email. If anyone is interested, one of my “treatises” regarding this plan can be found on my website at http://www.Messiah Or Not.com/Treatise.php.
