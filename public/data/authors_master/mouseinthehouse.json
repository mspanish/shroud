for sciencebod who said… \nThanks Mouse. I just tried responding to your same comments over on Dan’s site, but WordPress does not seem to accept my login and the commenst has not appeared.\nHere it is:\n“MouseInTheHouse is absolutely correct when he says that a thermal stencil image is a positive, not a negative, since dark charcoal-covered areas become dark scorched areas. I thank him for the opportunity to back-track a little on what I may have said previously, or at any rate to qualify it.\nTo produce a Turin-Shroud like negative, one that becomes a positive on the photographic negative, then the hypothetical sketched image would have had to be drawn as a negative, with a reversal of light and shade, which is admittedly unconventional. \nBut there may be strong practical reasons for doing so given the proposed technique: in a well-illuminated subject there will be a predominance of light reflective areas over ones that are in shade (eye sockets and the like). That would tend to give a scorch pattern with just a little scorch, but an awful lot of white space. By reversing lighjt and dark in the sketch, one ends up with something that makes a much bolder image but one that is still recognizable as a man, despite the reversal of light and shade.\nI hope that makes sense…”\nCould you oblige by cutting and pasting into Dan’s blog. I’ll try and sort out the WordPress thing later. Odd, because I am able to post comments to another WordPress blog without being pre-registered for that site… \nJanuary 2, 2012 3:36 AM\n\n","date":"January 2, 2012 at 8:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/thermo-stenciling-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thermo-Stenciling the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"mouseinthehouse","post":"how about the partial image on the reverse surface of the cloth with nothing in between? how about the halftone that causes only apparent saturation effects?\n\n","date":"January 3, 2012 at 7:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/thermo-stenciling-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thermo-Stenciling the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"mouseinthehouse","post":"i imagine the reference to a flying saucer was to illustrate that we easily misinterpret what we see when we are ill informed\n\n","date":"October 24, 2011 at 7:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/21/there-is-an-image-of-a-flying-saucer-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"There is an Image of a Flying Saucer on the Shroud of Turin"}],"misc":[{"author":"mouseinthehouse","post":"Somebody had to say it.
