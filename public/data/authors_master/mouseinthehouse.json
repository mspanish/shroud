I just tried responding to your same comments over on Dan’s site, but Word Press does not seem to accept my login and the commenst has not appeared. Here it is: “Mouse In The House is absolutely correct when he says that a thermal stencil image is a positive, not a negative, since dark charcoal covered areas become dark scorched areas. I thank him for the opportunity to back track a little on what I may have said previously, or at any rate to qualify it. To produce a Turin Shroud like negative, one that becomes a positive on the photographic negative, then the hypothetical sketched image would have had to be drawn as a negative, with a reversal of light and shade, which is admittedly unconventional. But there may be strong practical reasons for doing so given the proposed technique: in a well illuminated subject there will be a predominance of light reflective areas over ones that are in shade (eye sockets and the like). That would tend to give a scorch pattern with just a little scorch, but an awful lot of white space. By reversing lighjt and dark in the sketch, one ends up with something that makes a much bolder image but one that is still recognizable as a man, despite the reversal of light and shade. I hope that makes sense…” Could you oblige by cutting and pasting into Dan’s blog. I’ll try and sort out the Word Press thing later.
