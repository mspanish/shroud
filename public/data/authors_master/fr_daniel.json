{"art":[{"author":"fr_daniel","post":"The Peter Soons movie (http://vimeo.com/14072737) clearly suggests that an outline was artificially created, perhaps accidentally. The 3D glasses borrowed from a Shrek DVD makes this obvious. Isabel Piczek, Barrie Schwortz and many others from STURP have made it clear that there are no outlines in the shroud’s image but gradual changes in tone instead. Moreover, John Jackson demonstrated that the image quenches at three to four centimeters depth. That is not so in the 3D image. \nIf you believe what you see with 3D glasses on, then Isabel, Barrie and John are wrong. I don’t think so. Thank you for alerting us to this problem.\n\n","date":"October 11, 2010 at 10:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/10/10/troubled-by-the-new-shroud-of-turin-3d-web-site/","cat":"art","title":"Troubled by the New Shroud of Turin 3D Web Site"}]}
