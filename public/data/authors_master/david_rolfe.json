I am a professional film maker. It is my living. I will not make any money unless I get the film developed and taken up by a major studio and that is what this crowd funding is for. I did make money from my first film The Silent Witness in 1978 but the two I have made since then have lost (a lot) of money. I have returned to this subject at the end of my career because of what I know about it and as I have said in the campaign, the sense of injustice I feel. Let me come to the point about the blood. It is pure speculation on my part. But something has to explain why, when it came to the crunch, the Vatican did what it did to the test. I may well have been the “crunch”. I went to meet Professor Gonella to sign the contract I had been negotiating with him for several months on behalf of the BBC. We were going to film the test and broadcast the film about it along with the result as an exclusive. It depended on the tests being done blind, of course, and the labs signing up to the strict protocols that had been agreed in principle. When I arrived in Turin and met again with Gonella he was as white as a sheet. That morning he had just been informed “from above” that the protocols were being abandoned. If I had signed that contract as planned that day the Vatican – as well as Turin – would have been bound by it. Without the protocols I could not sign it. Jean Paul II was about to leave for a trip to South America. Cardinal Ratzinger (Pope Benedict) was his right hand man. After years of procrastination and politicking over the test with Gove and the rest of the C14 community there was now no room for delay. If the C14 had found in favor or the Shroud the clamor to follow up with every conceivable test would have been deafening and probably irresistible. The blood would have been high on the list. Who could say what that might (and still might) yield in terms of genetic information? We could be looking at the genome of God or of a humble and delusional carpenter. I think it very significant that Pope Benedict made an impromptu Easter exposition of the Shroud his last act as Pope. The cloth was on his conscience..","date":"2013-08-09","mins":"2:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here-is-a-crowdfunding-campaign-we-should-be-able-to-support/","cat":"art","title":"Here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support"},{"id":"comment-43424","author":"david_rolfe","post":"The zig zag/herringbone pattern on the Lirey medal indicates that this was a defining feature of the Shroud. Why, if it were only visible close up and relatively immaterial when compared with other features, might this be so? When the C14 test was proposed it was assumed the test was to be done blind and it was taken as a matter of course that a suitable piece of medieval linen herring bone weave would be found to make this possible and the British Museum, without hesitation, agreed to supply some. When the time came, somewhat to their embarrassment, the BM found that not only did they have no such material in their collection but when they scoured the world’s other museums for a piece for the purpose of the test – and we know how small an amount was required – they found that there was none available anywhere! As a result one of the protocols of the test was duly and quietly abandoned without official comment at the time or since and this remarkable fact only slipped out many months after. It is conspicuous by its absence in the interview with Michael Tite in the 6th video clip down on the page: http://tinyurl.com/o2w2z64 I think it might be safe to assume, therefore, that medieval viewers of the Shroud recognized this “unique” cloth was part of the story.

The visible blood marks are quite possibly the result of multiple causes. An initial one, whatever it was, and then, over the centuries, well meaning attempts by its various custodians to “touch them up” for the benefit of pilgrims travelling great distances to see the shroud and possibly – even when they arrived – having to view it from some distance. Certainly scores of metres. The holy blood being a major attraction the custodians might have felt justified to use anything from vermillion to other mammalian blood direct or via a leech. It would have been done with great care and dexterity so that these later applications remain undetectable. What interests me are the invisible (to the naked eye) stains. I believe that the “halo” is only readily observed when fluoresced.

It would appear there was no documentation of this particular episode which suggests, at the very least, a lack of professionalism. I am not certain what it is we disagree on. I remain open minded about the reweave theory. What we all have to live with is the fact that the one person who should know, Ms Flury Lemburg, refuses to countenance it.

Read the source carefully and not just Dan’s filleted version and that will be obvious as he should have pointed out before publishing this coy, stirring “A Reader Writes”.. Piece. The tendency for the supporters of Maillard to bleat about it rather than substantiate it tells you a lot about its viability.

All you need to do is create a positive image, preferably monochrome, but not essentially. You then place it on a frame with a plain backing and hang it somewhere where it catches the sun. Over time, and depending on just how much light it is exposed to, a perfect negative of the original will be created on the backing. I have seen a very impressive example made by an etching hanging in a Cotswold cottage south facing hallway for several years. When the engraving was sent for reframing the backing parchment had become a negative as perfect as anything Mr. Eastman at Kodak could have created.

The present proposal is not to study the Maillard reaction at all. In Shroud circles the expression “the Maillard reaction” has come to be used as a general term for Ray Rogers’ claim that the image has been formed by a Maillard reaction and, more surprisingly, that it involved gases that retained, within their gaseous state, information about some physical characteristics eg. The shape, of their source. His claim is based on experiments that he carried out simulating the conditions with the tomb. The work proposed is designed to test only the latter part of this claim by Rogers which is quite a surprising claim ie. That a clear image (comparable with the image on the Shroud) can be made on a recipient surface by gases that rise in a thermal current and retain, during their movement, the details of the surface, (wounds, fingers etc) from which they were released. This claim will be tested by the accuracy of the image they generate on a reactant surface. At the same time it will test to what extent any simultaneous diffusion within the gas phase obscures the image. This is as far as the proposal goes. This high quality image is an essential prerequisite before we go on to study what reaction has caused the image. If we do get the high quality image may some people may still need verify that it has the same chemical composition as the image on the Shroud. This would then lead into studies of the possible reactions that might have formed the image, including the Maillard reaction.
