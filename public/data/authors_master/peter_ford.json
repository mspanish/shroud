He also has been rediculed by this group of so called Shroudies. His discovery is of immense importance as he has given evidence to both cloths coming from the same man and the St Peters Veronica has far greater time history recorded. He has solved the mystery without carbon dating by his discovery and several of these Shroud groups who have vested interests in conitueing the circus are terrified of his discovery.
