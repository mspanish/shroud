{"art":[{"author":"dennis_dietz","post":"As a fan of Bruce Marciano, who played the role of Jesus in the Matthew video (word for word from the Gospel of Matthew), and who is a born again Christian, I was quite surprised to see the strong resemblance of the Akiane painting, confirmed by Couton as what Jesus looked like and Bruce Marciano.  Bruce is of Syrian and Italian descent, and his features are very similar to these images. The image of Jesus in the Matthew video was completely different from all other Jesus movies I have seen.  Jesus is seen as a fun-loving, caring, reach-out-to-people kind of guy.  The kind of guy I would want for a best friend to hang out with. Concerning the Shroud’s carbon dating, it appears that the sample taken was mixed cotton and linen used to repair the damaged Shroud.  This led to the the late date for the Shroud.  Other evidence for the Shroud is in the words that are placed around the shroud, all coming from the first century.   Wow, great stuff for believers!","date":"May 31, 2011 at 10:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
