All of the stacked layers of findings continue to be synergistically examined.  This whole trial brings us to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Jesus Christ is, indeed, God.  Reason being, only God could signature such a media that does not contradict in any way the Bible, yet it challenges and exceeds our latest forensic findings with our latest technological tools.  Each new finding reinforces God’s Signature.\n\n","date":"October 20, 2012 at 1:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/19/the-central-dilemma-of-the-shroud/","cat":"history","title":"The Central Dilemma of the Shroud?"},{"author":"stan_wenninger","post":"Interesting!

Very good.  The shroud is the most forensically studied media of all time.  The majority of information obtained from it was just within the last century.  Modern science cannot explain how it was made nor can they reproduce it so what are the odds of it being a “forgery”? :-)  see shroud pin board link here. http://www.pinterest.com/omega40/shroud-of-turin/ ﻿\n\n","date":"June 27, 2014 at 2:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/27/another-new-old-video/","cat":"video","title":"Another New Old Video?"}]}
