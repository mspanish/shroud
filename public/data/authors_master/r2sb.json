{"image":[{"author":"r2sb","post":"Giorgio, Do you know the  ULF camera type and model used by Enrie?   Did he use a yellow filter like Pia? Do you have any information regarding the camera lens he used,,e.g, glass or quartz? Enrie removed the glass window from the Shroud case before he  took his photos.  Do you suspect that his orthochromatic emulsion was exposed to some UV? Thanks for any insight..\n\n","date":"October 5, 2015 at 12:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"author":"r2sb","post":"Hello Giorgio,\nMy email address is rrsbarnard@verizon.net.
