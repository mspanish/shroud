Slightly off subject, Thomas Gainsborough was a good portrait artist wasn’t he? I did not have a thin enough brush so I had trouble with the hair. Colors are not as subtle. Anyways, If it was not for the fact the image resides on the outermost fiber of the fabric, or residing in the micro thin layer of starch fractions (As Ray Rogers believes) and The image did not show up in a VP 8 analyzer the way it does I would say the image was a imprint of myrrh resin and blood that once covered a body. High grade myrrh is transparent which would not show up if backlit. The color is right. Dr. Baima Ballone did say he found myrrh and aloes in the blood by anti body antigen testing. For someone hard pressed to think The Shroud was a contact image, that is the direction my research would be going. To start by covering a human cadaver in myrrh and aloes and wrapping in a shroud for 3 days and then remove it and see what you have. If one really knew scripture and wanted the most realistic looking Jesus imprint possible, that would be the way to go. I did it with a sculpture of Jesus once, the results were astounding. Myrrh resin hardens and will take on the exact shape of the 3 D figure. It looked like a linen statue of Jesus afterwards. You could even stand it up. But such a process would not match the chemistry and physics of the Shroud image. What is really needed is for Pope Francis to allow scientists just to scrape off just a bit of the image and analyze it. Perhaps down by the feet. Just a tiny bit.

Hypothetically speaking let’s say the Shroud was done using paint. The artist would need a good understanding of how to paint a mirror image, lefts and rights reversed. As a result of a contact image, lefts and rights are reversed, which is one of the reasons I believe a role model would be necessary to do the work. It is hard to image how the rights and lefts of an image are reversed without seeing it in a mirror to be certain it is correct and to replicate the effect. At some point the artist would have needed to make an imprint of a genuine human form and see how it transferred to cloth so his own depiction would be accurate. Side wound on linen is done correctly. Shown on right side as would happen with a contact image. When Image is displayed in a mirror the side wound moves the left and from the perspective of the person, would be on their right. Which would be correct. If the artist did not understand that as a result of a contact image rights and lefts are reversed the side wound would have been illustrated on the left side, not right side. Viewing it from our perspective, not the person wrapped in Shroud. This would be a work meant to be displayed/viewed in a mirror to show the true image. I can’t image an artist doing such a thing. Why not just make a imprint and be done. It would save time and look better. No chance of a mistake. Again hypothetically The Shroud was painted but the 1. Artist did not use plain weave white linen as used in Jewish Burial?! 2. Did not illustrate wounds in the palms of the hand?! 3. Did not illustrate eyes?! (for the most part left the canvas unpainted in that area) 4. Did not illustrate ears?! 5. Did not illustrate thumbs?! 6. Did illustrate a nude, bare butt Jesus with scourge wounds?! (the only work that does so) 7. Illustrated extremely excessive scourge wounds?! Based on what historical record? An early centuries or mid century artist depicting Jesus like this would probably end up in a burial Shroud himself or at the very least not have many friends in the city/town he lived in..","date":"2015-05-02","mins":"4:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/28/having-nightmares/","cat":"art","title":"Having Nightmares"},{"id":"comment-198162","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello of Daveb of Wellington: The only reason posted on this subject is because this is how I got involved with The Shroud in the 1st place in 2009. I was planning to do a photo realism resurrection painting & was looking for a role model to use as Jesus. Of course The Shroud came up. I would be the 1st to agree my imitation of the Thomas Gainsborough “Lady in Blue” does not match his great talent. It is flat out incredibly difficult to paint a photo realism looking portrait. My original on canvas does look better than this high contrast copy, but lacks the “super pro look” Thomas G gets. Quite a few steps down the scale from his work. Hypothetically speaking, you have 4 suspects brought in for questioning by forensic detectives to find out who is guilty of the crime/act of producing Shroud Image We have 1. Mr Paint 2. Mr. Imprint 3. Mr. Ammonia 4. Mr Light Most people would agree Shroud image is 1. Cunning 2. Baffling 3. Powerful Which of the 4 suspects is the most cunning, baffling and powerful?

I used to do replicas of famous paintings. I included a Caravaggio, A Thomas Gainsborough and a Van Gogh that I did. I once attempted the Shroud. It did not work out at all, I simply could not do it. I painted the Mona Lisa and other famous paintings but The Shroud ended up looking like a disaster. I threw it away it looked so bad. Photo realism is incredibly difficult to do. The Shroud of Turin would fall into the category of photo realism with some holographic observations made by people that have been up close and personal to it. One such person made comment, “the body appeared to come up right out of the cloth” looking at from a specific angle and disappear completely from other angles. Those were comments made by someone who spent an entire day examining the Shroud I have never seen a painting or known anyone that could produce this effect with paint or with photography. It is true, with perhaps some rare exception, lines are drawn when doing a painting, (I always do) and then smoothed out later so they cannot be seen. That also involves making fairly aggressive contact with the canvas with a brush or wet towel to hide the lines. This is a 14′ piece of cloth of a very unusual weave, that I cannot in my wildest imagination ever picture any person using to make a Jesus replica/photo realism work. Look at the dorsal image, It looks like a X Ray photo graph/ morgue photo. Would anyone out there like to hang this on their wall? The dorsal image? “Look at my painting” Possible, but highly unlikely. If one truly believes this is a painting. I would suggest going to the company in Belgium that has Shroud fabric for sale. 3 or 1 herringbone twill fabric, pure linen and purchase the finest point brushes made on Earth and a half a gallon of myrrh resin for pigment to get the straw yellow color. There is also a company that sells a 14 replica of The Shroud. Use that as a role model and begin the work by making micro tiny dots on the fabric, leaving some of the canvas colored and some uncolored. You cannot draw lines on a work like this. Dotted. It’s a mirror image, so you need some kind of role model to use to accurately capture rights and lefts reversed. The English language does not have words to describe how incredibly difficult it would be to replicate the “look and feel” of the Shroud image using paint. Photo realism is by far the hardest thing to capture on canvas. There are only a handful artists in the world that can really pull it off. Often they will use camera obscura to do the work and that does not guarantee it will look right. A lot of talent involved. If a mistake is made, one would have to purchase another piece of 14′ fabric and start over again. Long story short. If one went to the trouble of using a 14″ piece of cloth, why not just make a imprint with a real body? So much easier and it will be realistic looking. It would be a better theory to imply both were done. Imprint and some bizarre pigment The Shroud image reminds me of when we were kids, we would stick our faces into a copy machine and make copies. The Shroud has that “look” to it, a very genuine look. There is a reason for that. I am not posting this to start a debate. I just don’t have time. I suggest to the person that believes this is a painting, to actually attempt to do a “Shroud replica” just to get an idea of what this would involve. And I am saying that in a respectful sense.

I did some experiments with wrapping a myrrh covered3 D statue in linen. That is all. I wanted to see what would happen. Then I exposed the “linen myrrh statue” to bright flashes of light to see how the myrrh resin would react to the light. To see if bright light would change its color. Please excuse the poor quality of these photos taken 3 years ago. I filmed the entire experiment and took several still shots but I do not have access to them here. This is all I have on this computer. Myrrh resin is much like tree sap. When exposed to the open air it will begin to harden and get sticky, myrrh was applied to statue then wrapped in a pure linen cloth. Myrrh sticks to what it makes contact with and then hardens and makes a replica of the 3 D figure it is making contact with. Very detailed. I recently purchased some very pure myrrh resin from Egypt and am going to run some different experiments applying it to a herringbone twill pure linen cloth. I will photograph those results with a quality camera so you can see a decent quality photo. These are pretty poor. The linen will take on a 3 D form and then it flattens out over time. Myrrh is sepia, caramel color very close to what is seen on the Shroud. That does not mean that it is myrrh on The Shroud. I will not even get in that discussion. Just a few photos to see.

We certainly cannot and should not stereo type a person who believes the Shroud is authentic as being a           or one who does not is a. But unfortunately it does happen all time I know many people not convinced of the authenticity of the Shroud, intelligent people of good moral character. Good role models for their children. Your posts serve a positive purpose. If a civil debate can take place, great, I am all for that. Everyone benefits from that. To refer to a person as “anti authenticity” has a negative sound to it. Since you brought that up I am going to stop using that word. The Shroud is not a salvation issue. It is a witnessing tool only. If my belief/conviction the Shroud was authentic began and ended there, it would mean nothing. Meaningless. If one was to come to believe The Shroud was authentic and is physical evidence of the resurrection of Jesus it could lead to a person to consider the possibility that “if this is true then I should be able to make contact with this person who has risen from the dead” As crazy and as improbable as that may sound, Belief the Shroud is authentic could potentially lead to a person with some type of serious issue going on with their life, be that a health issue or financial in which all previous efforts to solve the problem have failed to consider a different course of action to solve the problem. An example would be a last resort desperate move to ask a “Higher Power Intelligence” to solve the “impossible challenge” Because “nothing else has worked” And Lo and Behold shortly after “asking the “Higher Power” for help, the “impossible challenge” is solved. This leaves one thinking, “I did ask for this thing to be done and now it is”, “Is the event of my asking the Higher Power for help and the problem being solved related or not related?’ Coincidence or not coincidence? Over the last 7 years I have seen enough physical evidence of the Spirit of God working in my life to be convinced beyond any reasonable doubt the Shroud is authentic. Many of which could not be presented as evidence in a court of law type setting. That is unfortunate. Belief that the Shroud is authentic can positively transform the life of another person I know that it has for me. It is what is done with that belief that makes the difference. Not just the belief. There is Faith without action, and Faith with action. The latter is the better. No one wants come to the end of their life with a “What If?” “What might have been” The Shroud is kind of saying “Give the Spirit of God a chance to work in your life” “All things really are possible with faith” The message behind The Shroud. In English Gemetria Jesus of Nazareth = 1128 Shroud of Turin = 1128 Behold the Image of Edessa = 1128 It’s not a painting =1128 Shroud is genuine = 1128 A picture of Jesus =1128 3 D Hologram of Jesus = 1128 Risen Lord Jesus 1128 Are these coincidences or not?

I would like to know the dimensions of the fresco in Rome. It should be a dead on match to The Shroud of Turin face. It is not likely an artist would change the dimensions, possible but not likely. Sometimes I will do a portrait X 2 if it needs to be bigger. But any deviation from the original, even a few millimeters will change the face and it will not come out right.

I have spent a great deal of time looking at The Manopello Image. I am going to need a bit more time before I put this footage together in a video, because it needs narration and some explanation. Bear in mind and I am sure you must know that a imprint image will have rights and lefts reversed. The Manopello Image if it is the result of imprint as said, the rights and lefts will be reversed. Meaning if this image is laid over and compared with The Shroud it must be laid over the negative image, not the positive. In the same way I cannot lay the negative image of The Shroud over the positive and expect them to line up. Rights and lefts are mixed up. I understand how this needs to be done because I have done it with The Sudarium, I also horizontally flipped the negative image of the Shroud and laid it over the positive, so the rights and lefts are in the same place and I can see the color reversal when I bleed the images together, which is actually a amazing sight. When doing this Manopello image, I am going show it from all angles, flipped horizontally both ways and placed over both negative and positive image, so people can see the difference and understand what is being done and why.

I spent well over one hundred hours looking at The Manopello image and placed it in The Shroud Face in every possible way, horizontally flipping the image and laying it over both the negative and positive image. In the process of doing so I discovered something unique about The Shroud image that I had never noticed before. Out of curiosity I horizontally flipped the negative face so it would match the positive and then slowly merged the 2 together so I could see the color reversal taking place in super slow motion. What are perceived as “high eyebrows” on the negative image, actually are not. That is just where the cloth made closer contact giving the illusion of “high eyebrows” which of course was copied in the fresco in this video and countless other frescoes. However, The Manopello image does NOT imitate the “high eyebrows” they drop lower and match the positive image of The Shroud, better than the negative. I seriously doubt the Manopello image is a result of using The Shroud as a role model, as in doing art. It looks more like the result of contact with a face and then touch ups added with paint. Although the eyebrows seem to be in the wrong place when laying it over the negative they are actually placed correctly if one desired the true image of the Man in The Shroud. The fresco matches up the with the negative image of Shroud incredibly well. One area that is very noteworthy is the forked beard that has 2 dark lines going off at a angle to the left and a blank area in between. This is copied exactly, Not only that, when that is lined up, everything else lines up, nearly perfect. The entire face. Every gap, length, distance and width. It is the easiest image overlay I have ever done because it fit’s so perfectly. You can put other faces in there, but I seriously doubt you will ever find a forked beard that fits in this image the way this Fresco does, and have every other aspect of the face line up near perfect when that is done. I had a harder time matching The Shroud face with the Shroud face than the Fresco. I am convinced the Shroud was the original role model and this fresco is a 3rd or 4th generation copy of it.

I do not think the Manopello image is a reproduction using Shroud as a role model, I think it is a contact image with a actual face. I wanted to know exactly where the Manopello image made contact with a face if it was indeed the result of contact. But how exactly? Both ways have many match points, whether the image is flipped horizontally or not, it is a little bit confusing. So using the paper you wrote and looking at it for well over 100 hours I made a final determination of the correct placement of the rights and lefts. As highly improbable as it may seem, that the Manopello image made contact with the face of Jesus it cannot be eliminated yet as a possibility. The fact the eyebrows are in a place that matches the color corrected image and are where they should be got my attention. That image was not seen until 1898. It could not have been used as a role model, yet it looks like it was the role model, something that was not yet in existence.

Outstanding presentation. There were 2 sources I found that presented this fresco, both claimed it was 1st Century, not 2nd Century. I believe it comes from the 1st or 3rd century, so I chose the number in between so it would not look like I am tilting the scale in favor of authenticity. To be fair on both sides, convinced and not convinced. The aspect ratio of both images in this video are NOT altered, it was easy to put them together because I did not have to do much of anything, just place one over the other. I can do the same with any image anyone would like to see. Using the same time sequence for fade in, exact same procedure. It is not difficult. I am in the process of doing a Mona Lisa, | Abe Lincoln and John Lennon. I can even do a Johnny Depp for Hugh.

I do have personal experience doing reproduction paintings that involve detailed face painting and landscape. I learned the hard way, you cannot make a mistake or be off even a few millimeters if you want a face to look right. To do a accurate face reproduction is difficult, detailed work that requires very specific and unique measurements to be replicated. No 2 faces are the same, in the same way no 2 snow flakes are the same when viewed under a microscope. I did go on google and got the best straight on shot of Johnny Depp I could find that looked like it could work. I will attempt with others of him. The problem is when I drop his face image into The Shroud it is not the same. I enlarged the image correctly and matched up the nose as perfectly as possible, then placed image over The Shroud and then the eyes are way below the place they need to be, and numerous other points will not line up. Some match some don’t. It is awkward looking. The same challenge occurred with every image I have tried so far, John Lennon (3 different photos) Mona L Isa and Abe Lincoln. What is noteworthy in the case of the fresco is that it just falls into place. I enlarged the image maintaining aspect ratio matched up the nose and that was it. It worked. No struggle, not fighting with the image to fit. The forehead lines up, the eyebrows line up, the eyes are in the right place, the gap between the eyes is correct, the space between eyes and nose is correct, Space between nose and mouth is correct. Beard lines up. The whole thing lines up. It took me less than 15 minutes to put the images together. No other image is lining up like this fresco does. It not only looks right, “it feels right” Nonetheless, I am going to play the role of a hard core serious skeptic on this and not just wave a white flag because I spent a few hours with 6 different images, if you have a image you think will fit, let me know and I will drop it in and see if it works..","date":"2014-08-19","mins":"11:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","title":"Matching Faces.

In the second that is done, that is no longer Johnny Depp, that is no longer John Lennon anymore. The reason I know is because I have the same photo of John Lennon and a similar one of Johnny Depp and put them up on video editing software and did comparisons. Those images do not match up with The Shroud of Turin face. The Fresco image is not altered. The aspect ratio is not altered to make it fit. I can put up those same photos of John Lennon and Johnny Depp and NOT change the aspect ratio and you will see a completely different image, One that does not match with the Shroud, awkward looking. There is not one part of the Fresco in this video that has been made smaller or larger while another part is not so “that it fits” Enlarging a photo is one thing, but to change the aspect ration is a completely different thing, ASPECT RATIO CANNOT BE CHANGED. I challenge anyone in the world, to come up with a better match than this fresco fits into The Shroud of Turin. Show me the photo and I will put it up and look at it. A photo that has NOT been altered and tailor made to fit. On a closing note I am not saying that I think you are dishonest or being deceptive, I don’t think so, I think the opposite, you come across as a extremely intelligent, honest person.

I gave it a thorough and honest appraisal. I had to tilt the image just a bit, spent a few hours working with it. It is not a completely awkward fit, but you would not connect the 2 and say one was used as a role model for the other. It does not just fall into place, like the Fresco did. It is kind of there and kind of not there type fit. It does have several points of congruency. There is no denying that. . Without changing aspect ratio I could blend the Lennon shot with the Shroud, so I know what you did was honest and upfront. It does work to some degree. Now The Manoppello Image that I just got through comparing, was a stunning match. It dropped into place in less than 30 seconds. I have never thought these 2 images had anything to do with each other. They look vastly different to me, but when you lay this image over The Shroud, it is truly amazing. Nearly a dead on match. The Manoppello Image looks like there is no way it is going to blend in, but it does. It works in a way hard to put into words, astounding is the 1st word that comes to mind. I do not even know what the Manoppello image is but I am certainly interested now. Anyways, I am interested in using the Johnny Depp that you used in the blend shot. I cannot find the image you used.

I can fade it in and make it passable. But you would never look at the 2 images and conclude they were related and one was used as a role model to make the other. The fresco looks like it was done using The Shroud as the role model. It is a superior match vs Depp image, there is no denying that. Some of the accidental characteristics of the Shroud image are copied on Fresco. No ears illustrated, odd beard shape with 2 angles going off to the left are copied. Owl shape eyes placed precisely where the artist would see white blotches. Forehead match. Eyebrows match, no variation. Hair parted in same spot, image is a straight on shot, exactly as seen on The Shroud.. The Image does not move as opacity is being changed and the images are combined. It is not unlike a very odd shaped puzzle piece that fits into the empty spot. The other photos I tried can fit in to some degree, but they are vague, and have errors. Like a similar puzzle piece that does not fit into the empty spot, close but no cigar. Fresco image is not a “vague match” it is precise match. A big difference. The fresco is a triple 777 winner. It fits inside just right. Like the combination to a lock, even if you are off a few numbers, the lock will not open. The fresco opens the lock, the Depp image does not. The numbers are off. To be fair and thorough, a large number of images should be compared, like 99,000 or 1 million using facial recognition software and congruence pts. Of course that It does not prove the authenticity of the Shroud. This is a single display that supports authenticity. A small stone placed on the scale. How much weight does it carry? Time will tell on that one, there is still some missing information on this Fresco. Can’t assign a numerical weight without the info. But it could start getting heavier or lighter, But either way, my paycheck stays the same. So I am not going to lose any sleep over it.

I have never believed that these 2 images had anything to do with each other. Until tonight. When I changed the opacity of one image and began to allow the other image to blend, you can literally see the eyes opening on the Man in The Shroud. The image does not move around during the blend, it stays in place. Everywhere. There was some extremely minimal shift, perhaps due to the fact the length of face was a few points off. What is truly bizarre is that these 2 images do not look like they could possibly be related. But yet they seem to be. They compliment each other, like 2 halves of the same person. When they come together something remarkable happens,like they were meant to be joined. I find it extremely unlikely this image fits in the way it does by random happenstance and dumb luck. Possible, but not likely. If this is coincidence, it is one hell of a bizarre coincidence. I need to test more images to be certain this same thing is not happening with other images.

The Fresco matches up with The Shroud image whether I want it to or not. Any portrait painter (including myself) would not have any trouble determining where to place the lines based on this negative image. There is more than enough image to know where to draw the lines of the face, chin, nose, length of head and beard. The sides of the face are vague,because of the white lines (chin band?) that would present a challenge. But All the important gaps are clearly visible. The placement, size and shape and of the eyes would be the most difficult aspect of this work, since none are illustrated. In which I would have struggled the hardest to place. The artist that did this fresco did not have the Shroud in front of him, but the person who painted the fresco on the wall in which this was made may have the actual Shroud as the role model. There is no way to be sure of that, but it CANNOT be eliminated as a possibility that this could be a second or third generation copy. To really map out the points correctly on the Shroud and make a reproduction would take 2 or more people, one up close to the image another standing back and confirming points. Once that math was established a standard would be set for future and additional replica’s. Which I am convinced is exactly what happened. But it does not matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove. I am not a point where I am able to do that yet. This Fresco is just a appetizer, the main entree is being prepared, so every body can get a full meal and be satisfied. In the early centuries of course a reproduction would be made with the rights and lefts not corrected. With “E” on left side. Unless one thought to do a replica with the image in a mirror, “Hey, let’s correct the lefts and rights of the image” Possible, but not likely. Comparison image should also be matched with the rights and lefts not corrected. This reproduction of Jesus matches the unique characteristics and even a few of the accidental characteristics of The Shroud of Turin. Some but not all. I am looking at it up close on video editing software. The images are placed on separate tracks and I can change the opacity so one begins to bleed into the other. I observing what I am seeing and writing it down. Going from one to the other. The same thing I have done with over a 100 paintings to replicate them. I cannot force either image to do what I want, or display what I want to see, only what is and then replicate it. I am very good at replicating art. I see a person replicating The Shroud. Starting from the top. 1. Same width of hair on top of head before forehead visible. 2. Parts hair in middle in replicating Man in The Shroud, 3. Forehead same length, width and shape 4. Eyebrows begin at exact same location and follow same unique shape 5. Owl Like Eyes added precisely where they need to be with proper space between 6. Nose begins and ends at the same spot and follows same shape 7.Does not illustrate ears, although it looks like they should be, matching Shroud 8. Illustrates blood stains in the hair where blood is on Shroud (Accidental characteristics) 9. Width, size and shape of lips match, follows same unique path. 10. Mustache and beard line up and leaves blank spots where Shroud image is blank. 10. Copies shape of dark angled lines of forked beard (Accidental characteristic) 11. Replicates lines on side of face by shading both sides. (Accidental characteristic) 12. Length, width and unique shape of entire head is the same. Where the image deviates is the hair on the lower ends. That is all. There is no one piece of evidence that authenticates The Shroud. This is only a single display that tips the scale toward authenticity. No one can argue that this tips the scale the other way, or has no weight at all. It is not possible to assign a numerical value of weight to this evidence until more information is available and more comparisons done, up to 1 million using Congruence points and facial recognition software. That is how a accurate number could be established. A combination of both.

What is noteworthy is that this image is not copying the “falsely perceived” high set eyebrows on the linen cloth image, That is the part that did not match. On the 1898 shroud negative and of course the later better photos you will be able to see what were “falsely perceived” as high set eyebrows are actually not eyebrows. They look to be eyebrows on the cloth image but they are not. Manopello image was “not fooled” by the falsely perceived high set eyebrows image on cloth and did not copy them, it matches the true face. They are set lower in the 1898 negative. Many of the old frescoes copy the “falsely perceived high set eyebrows” More evidence that supports authenticity. The Thomas Heaphy reproduction of the fresco copies the high set eyebrows, Also Thomas H sketch copies the angle of the forked beard, leaves blank what is blank on Shroud, and when that is matched up everything lines up, eyebrows, nose, eyes, lips, everything. That cannot be a coincidence, possible but highly unlikely. IT is a match, no one shall convince me otherwise. Let’s see another face put into the Shroud that has a missing beard section that matches up with The Shroud image and then have everything else line up when matching that. NOT HAPPENING. The Heaphy sketch is a superior match to that of the “Pantocrator” which supposedly has 200 matching points. If that is true the Thomas H sketch has more than 200 matching points. It is by far the best match to the Shroud there is. The Manopello image acts more like a contact image Not a reproduction of another work, but actually made contact with a face, possibly the face of Jesus. It does match the Shroud.

In making comparison we should use the negative image that appears white on the sides, not black. The artist did not see black, he saw white. I notice the artist makes his best estimate in forming the lower part of the face, not replicating the white lines which would look extremely out of place on a portrait. Worse, painting what would like a letter E on the forehead in a blood red color. If someone came to me and asked me to do a portrait painting, say a Mother who’s Son was brutally murdered and who’s face was disfigured and covered with blood as a result of death. And unfortunately the only photo she has of her son to give me as a role model is one taken of the body at the morgue or crime scene, would I replicate a morgue photo for her?! Something frightening looking or bizarre. And perhaps with tears in her eyes hands me the morgue photo, “Please do the best you can to paint my boy” “I don’t want to remember his this way” From the photo I can determine the dimensions of the face and do the portrait.

It did look convincing. Made a great mold and could stand up the linen, a linen statue of Jesus at the end, the sepia, caramel color, no traces of paint or pigment, yet the linen does look painted. Over time the cloth softens a bit and flattens. (3 years ago I did this) Of course no distance information, numerous other problems that did not match Shroud image. It was just a experiment I did, then exposed the myrrh resin to the brightest light I could get. A poloraid flash gun.

Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices I believe Shroud image is combo of both. Mr. Light and Mr. Imprint both involved. Bear in mind myrrh resin will react to light by changing color. Up close with a poloraid flash gun it will turn darker. ” Can be used as a substitute for cellulose acetate. (not as good though) Ray Rodgers found starch fractions and pectin that he believed made up the micro thin where the image resides. Perhaps you could try a few experiments with myrrh resin. Bear in mind it is expensive. I would not want your hard earned money to be spent with dissappointing results. But before eliminating myrrh as being on The Shroud I made these comparison notes. COMBINED CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF STARCH FRACTIONS & PECTIN IN COMPARISON TO MYRRH AND ALOES AS MENTIONED IN THE GOSPEL These substances (Starch fractions & Pectin) were found to make up the micro thin layer where the image of The Shroud of Turin Resides. Let’s begin by defining what starch & pectin is made up & see if the chemical properties match up with “the 100lb weight of myrrh and aloes” as mentioned in the Gospel of John. Amylose (you might disagree with that) was found on the Shroud of Turin and is a spiral polymer made up of D glucose units. It is the main component which makes up starch. Starch and cellulose are polymers derived from the dehydration of D glucose. Starch is a polysaccharide (meaning “many sugars”) made up of glucose units linked together to form long chains. The main component of Pectin is D Galacturonic acid, which is a sugar acid, an oxidized form of D Galactose. Pectin is a polysaccharide of 1 – 4 linked polygalacturonic acid with intra chain Rhamnose insertion, neutral sugar side chains and methyl esterification from many of the rhamnose residues, side chains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D Galactose, L Arabinose and D Xylose, PECTIN is also a uronic acid, Naturally occurring uronic acids are D glucuronic acid, D galacturonic acid. Let’s make a simplified list of what Starch and Pectin are made up of. 1.Uronic Acids 2.D Gluceronic Acid & D Galacturonic acid. 3.Polygalacturonic acid (An oxidized form of D Galactose) 4.Glucose 5. L Arabinose 6.D Xylose 7.Rhamnose NOW LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF MYRRH AND ALOES IN COMPARISON TO STARCH AND PECTIN Myrrh resin contains D Galactose and L Arabinose, Xylose and 4>0 methyl D Gluceronic acid From the resin yields Uronic Acid 19% D Galactose 60% L Arabinose 10% and L Rhamnose 5% Many of the health benefits associated with Aloe vera have been attributed to the polysaccharides contained in the gel of the leaves. A variety of polysaccharides are present in the cell wall matrix. An overall carbohydrate analysis showed that the cell walls of the aloe leaf hold mainly polysaccharides, cellulose and pectic polysaccharides whereas the skin of the leaf contains in addition significant quantities of xylose containing polysaccharides Aloes contain cellulose and hemicellulose and store carbohydrates. Saccharides in aloes are, Mannose, Glucose, L Rhamnose, Aldopentose THE PRIMARY POLYSACCHARIDE IN ALOES IS A PECTIC SUBSTANCE. MYRRH & ALOES STARCH & PECTIN 1. Uronic Acids 1. Uronic Acids 2. D Gluceronic Acid 2. D Gluceronic Acid 3. D Galacturonic acid. 3. D Galacturonic acid. 4. D Galactose 4.Oxidized D Galactose 5. Glucose 5. Glucose 6. L Arabinose 6. L Arabinose 7.. D Xylose 7.. D Xylose 8.. L Rhamnose 8. L Rhamnose Dr. Baima Bollone a professor of forensic medicine in Turin claimed to have found myrrh and aloes in the BLOOD by antibody antigen testing, this evidence would support his findings. Note Myrrh resin also contains many volatile oils and other chemical properties such as (limonene, eugenol, pinene, terpenes, sesquiterpenes, esters, cinnamaldehyde, cuminaldehyde, cumic alcohol, heerabolene, dipentene, m cresol and cadinene), resins (myrrhin, alpha , beta and gamma compiphoric acids, commiphorinic acid, alpha and beta heerabomyrrhols, heeraboresene, commiferin, campesterol, beta sitosterol, alpha amyrone All of which would have evaporated over the course of almost 2000 years with only the remnant of the sugars/carbs of the myrrh remaining. There is, on the outermost fibers of the cloth a clear washing residue: a thin coating of starch fractions and the various saccharides found in soapwort: glucose, fucose, galactose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid. Sugars in myrrh and aloes are the same sugars in soapwort 1.Glucose 2. Galactose 3. Arabinose 4. Xylose 5. Fucose 6. Gluceronic Acid 7. Rhamnose And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices. Bottom Line: Try some myrrh resin with your contact experiments. It also has other great side benefits, a great skin cream, it makes you look younger, not saying you look old. Leaves no trace of paint or pigment..","date":"2014-08-24","mins":"11:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/19/matching-faces-is-it-possible/","cat":"art","title":"Matching Faces.

The Shroud of Turin is actually involved in the writing of that book. That is a long story. But the title and illustration kind of says it all. I got convinced. It was written with a chemically dependent person in mind. It is based on the steps of the AA program. The reason for the seemingly long length of the book is because people represent the world in different ways, visual, audio and kinesthetic, so things are explained in all 3 ways, which takes up more space. I did a series of 40 paintings for the book that took up more space. Only some of them made it inside. Anyways I’ve seen some your past posts so I know you have elevated knowledge in chemistry and physics, far superior than my own primitive, basic understanding at best. I thought there might be something in what I wrote that could be useful info for you. Perhaps.not. I’m here in Central America on a rather serious mission, seeking the will of God and the power to carry it through. In the end it is all going to work out. I wish the same for everyone.

I unwrapped the figures after 3 days. They became linen myrrh and aloe statues. The links you posted made for fascinating reading. I have never seen them before. I’ve heard of “the cloth was flat at the time of the image” but was never convinced or sure of that. That has always been a unknown to me. Just thinking out loud here tonight and writing it down as it comes, On a LCD Screen (Liquid Crystal Display) prolonged display of non moving images can create a permanent ghost like image of these objects. To me, The Shroud Image is like that. Human DNA is made up of liquid crystal, a gel like substance. DNA emits a weak laser like light in the UV Range, a few billion photons per second. What would happen if that process was amplified? Perhaps The Shroud image is made up of the liquid crystal DNA of the Man in Shroud.

There is only one particular aspect of the Shroud image I am aiming to reproduce. So far I have already seen what I was hoping to see. The micro thin clear layer of sugars left behind on the fabric by the myrrh and aloes. People can disagree with Ray Rogers and rip into him all they want, but the fact remains his work was published in a scientifically peer reviewed journal. He says there is micro thin layer of starch fractions and pectin on the Shroud. I think he is right. . If he did not have very convincing evidence of that he would never have written a scientific paper stating so. He would make a very credible witness in a court of law. An imprint of myrrh and aloes is not going to cause accelerated aging of the fabric. It is something completely different I am proposing. The photos are interesting.

I saw the painting with the fingers in the shape of the reverse 3. Where do you come up with this stuff? Great find. Anyways I have something I would like you to think about and consider before responding back. Take your time. Could be days, weeks or months. I really want you to think about it/pray about it before responding. There is no urgency. When I say it, I think you will disagree, but I would like for you to at least consider this possibility and do your best to gain the deepest possible empathy with Nicodemus and picture yourself in his position knowing the events that occurred on the day Jesus/Yeshua was scourged and crucified. BOTH?! Think about the scenario as if YOU are Nicodemus and what you would do, You are rich and in a high enough position.to where you were likely present when Jesus was scourged. I would also like you to look into how wounds were treated in this time, often done with sugars. Myrrh and aloes contain multiple sugars. Here is my theory The Myrrh and Aloes mentioned in the Gospel of John were not purchased for a burial but to treat scourge wounds on a LIVING Jesus not a dead one. For whatever this is worth, The Spirit of God confirmed with me I am right on this. That is of course here say evidence and holds ZERO weight. Think about this. Nicodemus may have been present at the scourging or at the very least knew that the scourging took place and was extremely brutal. His thinking at that time must have been, “THAT WILL BE HIS PUNISHMENT. IT’S OVER” So he purchases the myrrh and aloes to treat the scourge wounds, to prevent them from getting infected. Full well knowing multiple applications would be necessary over a period of weeks to prevent infection, and purchases the excessive amount. Full body applications would be necessary over many weeks if proper healing was to occur. Myrrh resin was used in war to cover battle wounds. It is a antiseptic. Man In The Shroud had a lot of “battle wounds” Myrrh and aloes are more of the kind of thing you would use on a living person, not a dead one. To crucify a person after nearly brutally scourging a person to death is extremely abnormal. . This is very out of order. Nicodemus did not anticipate Jesus being crucified after, to be punished TWICE. Scourged and Crucified!? The myrrh and aloes ends up being used in the burial, But was not originally intended that way. Something to think/pray about it. The starch fractions and pectin on The Shroud. I believe that is the remnant of the myrrh and aloes applied to Jesus and cloth. A liquid form, not a ground up in a powder. Mostly water weight. I also believe the image resides in that thin layer.

I will have to purchase some aloes wood. I will attempt different burial wrapping methods in the near future, using a shotgun approach. 7 to 12 different ways. One of them has got to be right. Note. Max how the pure linen fabric “SHINES” in the video. And becomes a “A Large Shining Wrap” Hebrew sovev mawr = “large shining wrap The spelling of this noun, φαιλόνην implies these adjectives 1. Wide/Long 2. Upper (As in upper position such as a high priest) 3. L Ight bringing and light giving (something that shines) I included some of your high light quotes in this regard. 1.“Reminder: The Greek word phelonen/phailonen, “large shining wrap” (2 Th 4: 13) is to read in the light of the TS body image as the latter when seen under a certain angle and light, looks like translucid straw yellow impression. This is consistent with the use of flashing gold mosaic tiles to feature the Christ’s pallium in the Pudenziana apse mosaic.” 2. Reminder: the pallium is the Roman evolved form of the Greek himation, a word used in conjunction with the Image of Edessa 3.Actually BOTH Greek and Hebrew (the latter as his mother tongue) could have been natural to Shaul/Paulus. Paulus had Mark as his amenuensis so he could have used him. 4.In Hebrew sovev mawr = “large shining wrap” 5.In the Second letter of Timothy there are many words and phrases that do NOT exist in natural Greek. The non natural Greek word phailonen “naturally” translates Hebrew sovev mawr. 6.Reminder: the old French word Graal plays on/can be derived from the Hebrew phrase Gar El, “G.od dwells/shines (in it)” 7.Now the Greek Word φαιλόνην (phailonen) is derived from the ancient Greek word phao, “to shine”, “give light” (e.g. A heavenly light such as surrounds angels when they appear on earth) or “make manifest”.Thus philologically speaking, the word phailonen most accurately denotes “a very large wrap that shines The Wrap In This Video “Shines” Just another coincidence. 1.Image of Edessa was known as “the image not made my human hands” 2.Shroud of Turin is known as “image that cannot be made with human hands” 3. Coincidence? I don’t think so. Closing note: Max you really should have a book written documenting everything you know about the Shroud. If not, all your research and knowledge could be forever lost when you leave this world. I think it is important you have a book written.

This would no doubt help preserve the fabric and the blood stains. Myrrh resin is not unlike tree sap. This clear thin coating however is surprisingly not present on the fabric with myrrh resin only? (at least not to the same degree as the #3) The #3 sample fabric is hardened and smooth where the myrrh and aloes were applied, but not present with myrrh resin only. Very little change to the feel of the fabric other than darkening to some degree. I believe the thin layer of starch fractions and pectin that Ray Rodgers identified on the Shroud is the remnant of the myrrh and aloes put over the body of Jesus almost 2000 years ago. My theory at this time only. Cellulose acetate is used to coat holographic film plates. Myrrh and aloes together have a very similar chemical make up. What the catalyst would be to create a chemical reaction to make cellulose acetate is the thing I am not sure of. Possibly sulfuric acid in the sweat of Jesus,. However there are many different acids in myrrh resin any of which could be a catalyst that could convert myrrh and aloes into cellulose acetate. I a jumping way ahead of myself, blood stains 1st.

I just have not flattened the cloth out yet. I did not want to ruin my linen statues. One of the main purposes of doing this was to find out if a 3 D figure could be replicated with linen covered in myrrh and aloes. To make a “3 D linen statue” I did not know if a watered down version of myrrh resin would be enough to make a 3 D linen mold. Last time I did this I used 70 to 80% myrrh and less aloes. It is always said, “the color on Shroud fibers is the result of an accelerated aging process of the linen” How would myrrh and aloes coming in contact with linen accelerate the aging process of the linen? Answer: It would not. Like I said I am not proposing a contact image of myrrh and aloes being responsible for the image. I am more interested in the clear thin coating it leaves behind on the fabric which would contain 1. Glucose (A reducing sugar) 2. Galactose (A reducing sugar) 3. Xylose ( A reducing sugar) 4. Arabinose 5. Rhamnose 6. Gluceronic Acid Something that does cause accelerated aging is UV Light. We all know what happens when we get to much sun, the result is an accelerated aging of the skin. I believe the thin coating of myrrh and aloes on the Shroud came in contact with UV Light. Ray Rogers believes the image is within the micro thin coating and not on the fabric. Any thoughts on that? My final question is how would paint applied to the fabric cause accelerated aging of the linen fibers? We all know what happens when a defendant goes into court and his or her alternative theory explanation does not match the forensic evidence. It does not end well for the defendant. I am not going to try and change your mind on the paint theory. I fully understand how locked in you are into thinking that.

In the case of such high X² test values it is recommended that conclusions be postponed in order to obtain better samples and to conduct new tests” If that information was given to any ruling authority in a authenticity court room type setting the carbon dating results would be ruled inadmissible evidence and that would be the last time it was mentioned again.

The new drug did not alleviate the pain. Person 3. The New drug made the pain worse. Those results would fail an X squared test, because the results are inconsistent. The results from the 3 labs who tested Shroud Samples were also inconsistent. Minor inconsistency is to be expected to some degree within a sample group. X squared test sets parameters and limits to how much inconsistency can occur before it “crosses the safety line” and a new sample group would be required and repeat the tests. It is a mathematical way to be sure you can trust the results of things being tested within groups of 3 , 7, 9 or more. I am not a expert on the subject.

There is the type of person who must see something before they will believe. I get over 500 views a day on this subject from 208 different countries. I have received letters from many of those people who were losing faith and had that faith strengthened or restored because of The Shroud of Turin. It ends up making them interested in scripture again, a return and stronger faith in the word of God and a more personal relationship with Jesus. That is one of the after effects The Shroud has. I am one of those. I was also raised in the Catholic Church like you. I did not even know The Shroud existed all during that time. It was never mentioned in any mass I ever went to. Shroud is a witnessing tool, not a salvation issue. But it could be what brings a person to salvation. It did encourage a deeper involvement with the life of Christ for me (to say the least) and many others who I receive letters from almost every day. People from every country in the world are interested in The Shroud of Turin. If there are 2 words I would use to describe The Shroud of Turin it would be 1. Subtle 2. Powerful It has the signature character quality of the Spirit of God written all over it. Seriously, if we tested a blood sample from the corner of the Shroud, but not any of the other 400 blood stains. Would you be convinced that blood stain represented and was the same blood as the other 399 stains? At the very least they should have taken samples from 2 other areas, that way they would have at least 3 witnesses, instead of 1 witness cut in 3 pieces.

Huge. They love his music or they hate it. Some in the middle. I have some footage I want you to see. I got a huge breakthrough in my ELF research/communication experiments with a “Higher Power Intelligence/God” It involves the subject matter of the recent video I made. It is basically a “ask and you shall receive” type approach method which involves measuring the response of the person contacted by monitoring changes in the AC Voltage and also measuring the HZ frequency of that AC voltage source on a ELF Sensor. A numerical response. (Hz Frequency is the number of times an electrical signal oscillates in one second) A numerical response in a specific code and sequence of numbers that clearly would demonstrate the sender of the info has superior ability and intelligence and is directly responding to the person “asking for the info” (Beyond a reasonable doubt) I have this new evidence on film that supports authenticity. I will not use the word “proves” I have been doing this type of research on and off for 5 years. I knew someday it would get connected into Shroud Research. In the same way someone who is blind cannot see someone or be able to read by sight, they can read by touch. Receive info using a different method. This type of communication is reliant upon the Sender controlling the number of times an electrical signal oscillates in one second into specific number sequences that “spell a word” Because we cannot see something does not mean it is not there. But we can measure it on a scientific instrument and prove that the “unseen thing” does indeed exist and is a genuine demonstrated reality. Presence of the Spirit of God can take form of electricity and that electric presence will have a AC voltage and Hz Frequency that can be detected and measured on a scientific instrument, only if The Spirit of God allows that to happen. The Spirit of God allowed this to happen 2 nights ago. Rare gift meant to be shared with others. That is why I am sharing this to you.

Max Limit Set by British Museum was set 5.99 Samples tested out at 8.56 Way Over The Limit! To further confuse the debate there are those that will argue the 8.56 figure in not right, and that the samples failed the X squared test by a smaller margin, but they still FAILED. That’s it, it’ over. That means you have to start over again with a new sample group and re do the carbon date test over again. It really is that simple. That is why the British Museum chose the X squared test, because it is the acid test to know if the results could be trusted as being 95% accurate or not. Results should never have been published in the 1st place. . Based on that alone the carbon dating results would be ruled admissible evidence by any ruling authority in a court of law as evidence. If a forensic detective collected 3 blood samples off The Shroud and one came back as being type O, another type AB and another Type B………..STOP THERE Need more be explained? The matter of the authenticity of The Shroud belongs in a higher court type setting, where a judge or ruling authority decides what can be presented and what cannot presented as evidence. The carbon dating results would never be allowed as admissible evidence. In the same way some of things the pro authenticity side is presenting would not be admissible as evidence. . The sword would cut both ways. Question: Does the forensic evidence agree with the X squared test? Was there an inconsistency in the sample group? According to Ray Rodgers there was.

It is nearly complete. What caught my eye and delayed me from uploading it, was when I noticed how the Manoppello image had lower set eyebrows that matched the 1898 version of The Shroud, with color correction. Most (if not all) the early frescoes replicate the owl like eyes and the “falsely perceived” high set eyebrows. The Manoppello image does not do that. If one was to argue this was made by men in the mid centuries what was used as a role model? Because they surely did not use the negative Shroud Image on linen otherwise they would have copied the owl like eyes and the high set eyebrows, like everyone did. How did they get such a perfect match without having the 1898 version to use as a role model? If the Pantocrator really has 180 points of congruency, then the Manoppello image has more. It is a better match. However looking at the 2, they look completely unrelated. The Manoppello image looks like a painting, it does not look authentic, yet could very well be authentic, I believe it is possible the cloth did make contact with Jesus and color was added by someone after. How that was done? I don’t know. But it looks that way. Contact image with color added later. Part Original, Part Not Original. Because of this, the video requires narration along with the images and I need more knowledge of it’s history before I can present it. I must have a more complete understanding of the image and it’s history before I present it. I know I have a few hundred hours alone into it, just looking at the images overlaid together.

We can forgive and forget. Be Understanding. It is important that we recognize our mistakes and make corrections as soon as possible. The 1988 samples did not pass the X Squared Test. (Chi Value Square Test) That is not a minor issue, it is a major problem. If it happens in a clinical trial, the drug company doing the testing MUST start over again with a new sample group, no exceptions. To get FDA approval on a drug, drug being tested must pass the X squared test. If not, they will not get FDA approval. In the same way the results of the 1988 Radio Carbon Dating should never have been approved or published as being 95% accurate. Knowing these facts how could anyone in their right mind still stand up and defend the carbon dating as being accurate? Apparently they must not be aware of how important a Chi Value Square Test is.

I took 15 second frames of each image and then slowly bleed them in together so the effect of the 2 images coming together can be seen slowly When the Manoppello cloth is seen from back side rights and lefts are reversed. I’ve seen it displayed both ways. A subtle difference, not major When overlaying The Manoppello on the Shroud image that is on linen, that is where there is drift, because the image on linen gives a false impression that there are high set eyebrows. All the frescoes copy this style. The Manoppello image does not. There is what appears as drift in overlaying the 2 shroud images together because of the color reversal.

Would a team of researchers take 1 pollen sample of the corner of the Shroud and then post in headlines to the world the origin of the fabric based on that? “That’s it, were done with that part of the research, case closed” Or take one blood sample off the corner of The Shroud and based on that alone make a determination as to whether the blood on the Shroud was genuine or not? “No, we don’t need to test any of the other 400 blood stains, one is good enough” When you have time could you please take a second look at the 2 images. 1. Position of eyes on Shroud. One is lower, one is higher 2. Swelling of right cheek 3. Curve of nose (moves right to left when horizontally flipped) Those aspects must match, there is less drift when the “M” image is flipped the other way. I flipped the Manoppello Image horizontally and put the 2 together both ways and have examined them as closely as I can. Only one way is correct. Rights & lefts are reversed when M image is seen from back side. One is nearly a mirror image except for the hair at the top and one is the true image. This is normally a very simple thing to do, to make sure right side is matching right side and left to left. With these images it not so simple. To the average person they would not see any difference at all, between the 2 regardless of which image is overlaid. They are close. I believe the way they should be lined up is with the Manoppello image flipped horizontally. I used the photo I got from Barrie to do the overlay. Take a second or possibly a 100th look, do you think it is possible that the correct overlay is with the “M” image flipped the other way? I am certain your knowledge is superior to mine. But every time I examine it, I see it matching better the other way. I prefer to be in agreement with you, not the other way, What is the prime focal match point? Eyes, nose, swelling of right cheek?

Here is a way to see for yourself up close and personal. I did a overlay. I suggest putting it up on a big screen so you can see it in the best quality. No one can accuse me of manipulating evidence in this, because I did a fair, honest, straightforward overlay. Aspect ratio of the image used were not altered in any way. I used what I believe are the top 3 images in the world that match to the face of Man in Shroud. I have heard it said how any face can be put in here and it match just as well. It is flat out not true. That is why I did a slow motion overlay so any drift can be seen and I went in and did close up shots. Some of things being replicated are forked beards, crooked noses, high eyebrows and owl eyes. Bizarre match points that go beyond coincidence. What is really amazing that I did not notice before was my overlay with the Pantocrator, look at the circles around the eyes the artist adds. Real interesting. Note how they match the negative image. Whenever the Pantocrator is overlayed the same mistake is always made. 1. Using the positive image The artist used the negative image as a role model to do the fresco, not the positive. There is a BIG difference between the 2. Especially where the eyebrows are placed and how the eyes are placed. The color reversal changes the look of the face. I saw the Pantocrator image overlayed with the Shroud negative image for the 1st time. I was amazed how well it fell into place. I never really thought much of it until recently. Look at the circles around the eyes that are illustrated. Look how they match to the negative image. The artist saw the version with the “falsely perceived” high eye brows and the big white spots for eyes. He replicates them in the fresco. Look at it closely. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind the Shroud was the role model for this. That takes out the carbon dating. The Manoppello image as well is a incredible match. There is discussion about the #3 bloodstain after viewing the overlays. You will likely not want to discuss that.

Someone talking imprint. In a comparison analogy this would be the equivalent of a new detective hired to shed new light on a unsolved murder case going back and re questioning a suspect that was eliminated as being possible of committing the crime. Despite being told with unmistakeable clarity that this suspect has already been questioned by 100’s of other detectives and each time he is eliminated, the new detective gets the idea in his head that somehow “this guy did it’ Perhaps a even better comparison analogy, is that of a person in a mental institution that keeps banging their head against a wall all day, but if Joseph Accetta wants to bang his head against a wall, let him do it. The closest imitation done of The Shroud Image (a very small fragment of it, not a complete image)actually involves using high frequency, short wave bursts of microscopic lasers. We can logically conclude that The Shroud image was formed in this manner. Now Russ B’s theory of Jesus being the light source that formed Shroud image has solid ground in what are not widely known but established scientific facts. 1973, Miller, Webb and Dickson described DNA as a holographic projector (see “Embroyonic Holography”). In other words, genes encode and express themselves via light and radio waves, or acoustical holography (see “Quantum Bioholography”, Miller, Miller and Webb, JNLRMI , 2002). Delocalized interference patterns create calibration fields (blueprints) for our bodies’ space time organization. The system works as a biocomputer — a wave biocomputer. DNA can also function as a gel like liquid crystal, emitting a weak laser like light that can be converted into an electro acoustic signal. “Our body is a walking crystal. We can receive, we can transmit and we can store electro magnetic energy.” – Dr Norman Shealy, American Holistic Research Physician and Neurosurgeon. The only lasers that can could create a image that would be less than the thickness of a human hair such as seen on the Shroud are Liquid Crystal Lasers, the chiral liquid crystal provides sufficient feedback to generate lasing within a device of thicknesses less than a human hair. Coincidence: Human DNA is made up of a gel like liquid crystal that can emit microscopic laser light. That is a fact, that is not speculation. I am convinced that if the gel like liquid crystal DNA in the human body was exposed to a fine point, minimum 4 decimal point accuracy electro magnetic field it will fire off a microscopic laser light capable of producing the Shroud image. Not sound or radio, but magnetic that would cause the DNA to oscillate and react by emitting light. Bottom Line: Russ B’s Image Formation theory is correct, “Jesus was lit up like a Christmas Tree” That is the only remaining possibility. The only suspect that cannot be eliminated. And no matter improbable that may seem, it must be the Truth.

I think it is important not to lose sight of the fact (or evidence that strongly suggests) that a brutal and sadistic murder took place. We want to give a name to the person who was wrapped in that Shroud. Out of respect for him and to do a thorough investigation. I believe the Spirit of God has given us all the evidence we need to be able to make these determinations, we just need to put it all together. When I hear 14th century printing, I think Walter Mc Crone, When I hear that someone from STURP is going to present evidence of the Shroud being a print from 14th century, I am shocked, in the same way if I read Barrie S. Was going to give a presentation of a similar nature. I thought at the very least we were at a point in the investigation where we could all agree that the Shroud was in existence in the 7th century. Alright, so I am wrong on that. One of the focal points of the investigation should be in determining what the calculated odds that all the match points between the Sudarium and The Shroud are coincidental and do not come from the same person. What is that number? We should know it. I blame myself for not having it available to post here. It shows my own investigation has not been conducted thoroughly (Shame on me) I suspect that it is one in several million, but I am not qualified to quote the odds of probability and chance on that. But it looks something like this. Match Points 1. Type AB Blood 2. Blood degraded to the point on both cloths where rh factor cannot be determined. (That is actually a match point) 3. Both contain post mortem blood & fresh blood 4. Both cloths contain pulmonary edema fluid 5. Both contain pollens that only bloom at time of passover 7. Absence of clotted blood on both 8. Elevated levels of bilirubini on both 9. Fabric on both is same thickness, same threads per surface unit. 10. 120 points of head on Sudarium, match head area of Shroud 11. Nose of the man on both cloths is 8cm 12. Identical form of chin on both heads (A revised list that everyone can agree on would have to made, this is a sample/example list only) We need to approach it from a purely mathematical standpoint. Neither adding or taking anything away & calculate the odds of probability and chance that all the match points are a coincidence and do not come from the same person and for the time being leave the name of “Jesus” out of the equation entirely. EXAMPLE; The calculated odds that all the match points between the person whose head made contact with the Sudarium and the person whose head made contact with the Shroud are coincidental and are NOT from the same person are 1 in 1 million or 1 in. What is the number? When we know that number we should be able to draw a logical conclusion, one that we can all be certain of beyond any reasonable doubt. I think everyone here already knows deep down inside the conclusion that would be determined after seeing that math. The problem is being able to agree on what are established facts in the case file. Even going back to my opening statement. If we cannot even agree that a wrongful death took place there is no point in even continuing. That has be determined and agreed upon 1st and foremost before anything else. I thought that was done. Likely I am wrong again. How convinced is the scientific community of the conclusions drawn by the Spanish Center For Sindonology? FACT: The Sudarium of Oviedo was in existence in the 7th century. . FACT: Spanish Government believed the cloth to be authentic, and was the property of Jesus of Nazareth. Are those 2 things we could all agree on? Bottom Line: I think the Shroud investigation should at least be narrowed down to a 7th century event that took place, not a 14th century event..","date":"2014-06-05","mins":"10:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/04/anticipating-the-conference-joseph-accetta-on-14th-century-origins/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Anticipating the Conference: Joseph Accetta on 14th Century Origins"},{"id":"comment-127076","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hi Hugh, I thought I would add the list of the 7 properties that make up the micro thin layer of sugars/starch fractions that Ray Rodgers wrote in his peer reviewed journal. 1. Glucose 2. Fucose 3. Galactose 4. Arabinose 5. Xylose 6. Rhamnose 7. Gluceronic Acid Coincidentally these are all properties of myrrh resin. Myrrh is over 50% glucose and is made up of mostly sugars including all of the ones that are listed here & gluceronic acid. Myrrh also contains acetic acid, that was also found on Shroud fibers. For whatever it is worth it is of my opinion that this is the remnant of the myrrh resin used by Nicodemus that we are seeing. The color is practically a dead on match to myrrh resin. I wrapped a 3 D Sculpture of Jesus in a pure linen fabric coated with myrrh resin for 3 days just to see what would happen to the cloth. (it formed a extremely accurate 3 D mold) It was actually a bit shocked when I removed the linen from the sculpture. Myrrh resin hardens, it ended up like a linen statue. (the linen softens and flattens over time, I did this almost 3 years ago) Anyways not to get to far off track but it is of my belief that Nicodemus purchased the excessive myrrh resin to treat the scourge wounds of Jesus, thinking he would be scourged and released. Not thinking or purchasing it to be used for burial. But it ended up being used that way. Prisoners are not normally scourged and crucified, Nicodemus did not foresee the later happening. (my theory/speculation) Myrrh resin also has chemical properties similar to that of cellulose acetate which was used to coat early film plates. It is of my opinion only, that this is the reason why the cloth and the blood stains have been preserved as well as it has, considering the age of the Shroud. (preserved in myrrh) Also I believe the elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood are a contributing factor for why the blood retains the red color. The scripture account and forensic evidence match up in this case. And there came also Nicodemus who 1st came to Jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a 100 lb weight, then they took the body of Jesus and wound it in the linen cloth with the spices.

Building a laser requires two things: a lasing material that amplifies light from an external source (a ‘gain medium’) and an arrangement of mirrors (an ‘optical cavity’), which concentrates and aligns the light waves into a tight beam. Until now, the gain medium has only been made from non biological substances such as doped crystals, semiconductors or gases, but in this case the researchers used enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) — the substance that makes jellyfish bioluminescent, which is used extensively in cell biology to label cells. The team engineered human embryonic kidney cells to produce GFP, then placed a single cell between two mirrors to make an optical cavity just 20 micrometres across. When they fed the cell pulses of blue light, it emitted a directional laser beam visible with the naked eye — and the cell wasn’t harmed. The width of the laser beam is “tiny” and “fairly weak” in its brightness compared to traditional lasers, says Yun, but “an order of magnitude” brighter than natural jellyfish fluorescence, with a “beautiful green” colour. I believe this type of research is the direction we need to be headed in to learn more about the Shroud image, not to go back into the dark ages and the stone knife and bearskin thinking of The Shroud image being a result of paint, pigment or imprint, add camera obscura to that as well. I am not by any means any kind of expert in microscopic laser technology, but I am fast learner. My area of research before getting involved with the Shroud of Turin was in ELF waves and ELF technology. I still do field research in this area and I am in fact getting ready to fly overseas to get started again. When I have something more solid on video tape I will show it to you. Like you, I am a person who believes physical evidence is a critical part of a convincing presentation. I agree, we need more physical evidence that would demonstrate how a human cell is capable of emitting a microscopic laser that we could observe, measure and compare with Shroud image & to get it on film and show it. I am working on producing that. When I get it I will be in touch again.

Because it has a micro thin layer of myrrh and aloes on it. Myrrh is like tree sap with similar chemical properties to that of cellulose acetate, that would help preserve the linen. These are some comparative notes I wrote on the subject. COMBINED CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF STARCH FRACTIONS & PECTIN IN COMPARISON TO MYRRH AND ALOES AS MENTIONED IN THE GOSPEL These substances (Starch fractions & Pectin) were found to make up the micro thin layer where the image of The Shroud of Turin Resides. (By Ray Rodgers) Let’s begin by defining what starch & pectin is made up & see if the chemical properties match up with “the 100lb weight of myrrh and aloes” as mentioned in the Gospel of John. Amylose was found on the Shroud of Turin (by Ray Rodgers) and is a spiral polymer made up of D glucose units. It is the main component which makes up starch. Starch and cellulose are polymers derived from the dehydration of D glucose. Starch is a polysaccharide (meaning “many sugars”) made up of glucose units linked together to form long chains. The main component of Pectin is D Galacturonic acid, which is a sugar acid, an oxidized form of D Galactose. Pectin is a polysaccharide of 1 – 4 linked polygalacturonic acid with intra chain Rhamnose insertion, neutral sugar side chains and methyl esterification from many of the rhamnose residues, side chains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D Galactose, L Arabinose and D Xylose, PECTIN is also a uronic acid, Naturally occurring uronic acids are D glucuronic acid, D galacturonic acid. Let’s make a simplified list of what Starch and Pectin are made up of. 1.Uronic Acids 2.D Gluceronic Acid & D Galacturonic acid. 3.Polygalacturonic acid (An oxidized form of D Galactose) 4.Glucose 5. L Arabinose 6.D Xylose 7.Rhamnose NOW LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF MYRRH AND ALOES IN COMPARISON TO STARCH AND PECTIN Myrrh resin contains D Galactose and L Arabinose, Xylose and 4>0 methyl D Gluceronic acid From the resin yields Uronic Acid 19% D Galactose 60% L Arabinose 10% and L Rhamnose 5% Many of the health benefits associated with Aloe vera have been attributed to the polysaccharides contained in the gel of the leaves. A variety of polysaccharides are present in the cell wall matrix. An overall carbohydrate analysis showed that the cell walls of the aloe leaf hold mainly polysaccharides, cellulose and pectic polysaccharides whereas the skin of the leaf contains in addition significant quantities of xylose containing polysaccharides Aloes contain cellulose and hemicellulose and store carbohydrates. Saccharides in aloes are, Mannose, Glucose, L Rhamnose, Aldopentose THE PRIMARY POLYSACCHARIDE IN ALOES IS A PECTIC SUBSTANCE. MYRRH & ALOES STARCH & PECTIN 1. Uronic Acids 1. Uronic Acids 2. D Gluceronic Acid & D Galacturonic acid. 2. SAME 3. D Galactose 3. Oxidized D Galactose 4. Glucose 4. Glucose 5. L Arabinose 5. L Arabinose 6. D Xylose 6. D Xylose 7. L Rhamnose 7. L Rhamnose Dr. Baima Bollone a professor of forensic medicine in Turin claimed to have found myrrh and aloes in the BLOOD by antibody antigen testing. ( A good way to test for it) Of course Myrrh resin also contains many volatile oils and other chemical properties such as (limonene, eugenol, pinene, terpenes, sesquiterpenes, esters, cinnamaldehyde, cuminaldehyde, cumic alcohol, heerabolene, dipentene, m cresol and cadinene), resins (myrrhin, alpha , beta and gamma compiphoric acids, commiphorinic acid, alpha and beta heerabomyrrhols, heeraboresene, commiferin, campesterol, beta sitosterol, alpha amyrone All of which would have evaporated and no longer be present over the course of almost 2000 years with only the remnant of the sugars/carbs of the myrrh remaining. There is, on the outermost fibers of the cloth a clear washing residue: a thin coating of starch fractions and the various saccharides found in soapwort: glucose, fucose, galactose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid. Sugars in myrrh and aloes are the same sugars in soapwort 1.Glucose 2. Galactose 3. Arabinose 4. Xylose 5. Fucose 6. Gluceronic Acid 7. Rhamnose And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices. I believe one of the reasons this was done, was because the Lord wanted the fabric preserved so it would last. Myrrh would react to laser light by changing color, light yellow, medium yellow/ sepia. The color where image resides on Shroud fabric is a dead on match to myrrh resin, no one can deny that. D Galactose is a reducing sugar, the main ingredient in myrrh resin. In this way I agree with a maillard reaction but not with ammonia, with light. Laser light, in straight lines. I believe Mr. Light is responsible for The Shroud image, the other suspects are eliminated beyond any reasonable doubt, note I said reasonable. None of the other suspects possess the intelligence and the ability to encode distance information as seen on Shroud. Eliminate Mr. Paint, and Mr. Imprint and also Eliminate also Mr. Ammonia, not smart enough and he stinks. Mr. Light is the last remaining suspect who can’t be eliminated as being responsible for Shroud image. He’s the fastest and the smartest. Sorry to get off track. My apologies to everyone on this blog site for getting off the subject Charles asked about here at the end. To produce Shroud image you need to be fast and smart. Mr. Light is both. I do not normally post outside my own channel, I refuse to get into a negative argument with anyone. I am peace seeking person, not a negative arguments. Bear that in mind in responding to this.

Unless there is a historical record found saying “And Paul of Tarsus and Peter took the 14′ long Mandylion /Shroud and hid in the catacombs of Rome” It is my belief only, after it’s mission was completed in Rome, meaning Rome converted to Christianity, the Shroud was moved back to Edessa. (Hugh Farey would say I need to see physical evidence of that please) Just looking at the location only, (the catacombs)not saying that The Shroud was kept there. It would be a good location to hide it. 12 miles long, and 4 or 5 different levels, A big underground city. A bunch of graves and tunnels, imagine having to go in and find it, even knowing it was there. You would have to start exhuming several dozen into hundreds of bodies or looking for hidden places within walls, ect. There is what is believed to be a 1st Fresco of Jesus (perhaps as late as 3 AD) found in these catacombs, it is one of the closest matches to The Shroud I have seen. I know that does prove the authenticity of The Shroud. No one piece of evidence does. Only when all of the evidence both for and against authenticity is combined together and each small stone/piece of evidence is given a numerical value and placed on a scale can we see where it is tipping. We would need a group of experts to assign and agree upon the weight value of each piece of evidence. Both for and against. Then bring out the scale and start the process. See which way the scale tips at the end. L Ike I said previously, I enjoy reading your commentary.

Here are some photos of what is believed to be a 1st or 2nd century fresco of Jesus from the Callistus Catacombs. Https://www.facebook.com/robert.page.5688/photos I blended the face of the fresco with the Shroud image from the linen, because that is what they saw, not the positive image. Then there are photos of each separated. They are on the top page, front row. (There are also a number of photos of my vacation rental property in Costa Rica that you are free to look at if you want) This was written about the fresco. I do not know how reliable the source is. The Callistus Fresco The Callistus Fresco is an Image of Jesus whose authenticity is qualified by its Source and history. The artist of the beautiful fresco of the Face of Jesus found in the Callistus Catacomb is anonymous, but it is logical to assume that someone who had seen Jesus painted it, maybe a close disciple of His, as only the early Christines gathered in the Catacombs. The Fresco not only resembles the likeness of Jesus on the two known Relics that have an imprint of His Image and His only known Real Photo, but it has 150 PC with the imprint on cloth of the Face of Jesus on the Holy Shroud of Turin. Besides being a magnificent art piece, the ‘Callistus Fresco’ is the first and most ancient portrait known of Jesus the Christ. It is believed to be of the first century as Pope Urban II is shown in the painting looking intently at the face of the Christ. Pope Urban II reigned from 222 230 AD.","date":"2014-08-17","mins":"3:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/15/comment-promoted-looking-beyond-an-edessa-constantinople-route/","cat":"history","title":"Comment Promoted:  Looking Beyond an Edessa-Constantinople Route"},{"id":"comment-144263","author":"dave_hines","post":"Good Afternoon Mr. Charles Freeman: When it comes to authenticity of The Shroud a person is either convinced or not convinced. There is no in between. Undecided is not convinced. Harboring some doubt is not convinced. The “not convinced side” compels people to go way outside their normal comfort zone and actually have to start learning something new. Shroud research makes it necessary to study art & literature, science, math, history, add infinitum to the list of different paths a person could be pursuing and where that person will eventually wind up as a result of launching a investigation in the authenticity of The Shroud. It is positively life transforming. If we did not have the “not convinced side” looking for the clink in the armor of The Shroud it would take all the fun out of Shroud research. There would be far less urgency to learn anything new. A person setting out to prove the image was man made could wind up discovering some new way of making images that could make that a person a millionaire. Or someone could find a way to change cinnabar into gold, because The Shroud forces you to have learn things about chemistry and physics, whether you want to or not. If this Shroud Blog Site was all one sided toward authenticity it would take away from the excitement, fun and joy of doing the research. To all those “not convinced” The Shroud is authentic and posting comments, thank you. I am a better man because it. There is the old saying, “Success is about the person that you become” Shroud research has made me a better person.

I normally do not post outside my own channel anymore but I felt compelled to so hear goes some wild speculation. I think of Joseph of Arimathea purchased the closest approximation to what he could find that would substitute for a burial shroud and purchased a fine linen table cloth/court hanging type linen from a merchant outside the Damascus Gate before going to see Pilate to get permission to get the body. Sometime around 3:30 PM that afternoon. I think the head cloth is also purchased at the same time the Shroud linen is obtained, then Joseph of A returns to Golgatha where the head cloth was placed over Jesus and then he goes the route back through the Damascus Gate to see Pilate. The distance between Golgatha and the Damascus Gate is a short distance. I think the time gap between leaving Golgatha, going to see Pilate and returning is about 1 hour. I think Jesus is taken down from the cross around 4:30 to 5:00 PM, sun sets between 6:30 and 7:00 PM, not much time left. Likely some kind of exchange of money between Pilate and Joseph of A. Scripture account says Joseph went boldly to Pilate, begged/craved the body of Jesus, as in “He really wanted it bad and was going to get the body of Jesus no matter what it cost” During the Passover there will be a lot of different merchants from surrounding countries coming in to sell their textiles/goods, the Damascus Gate is the main entrance to the city and the place where a merchant would have the highest probability of selling their goods. Big festival events always draws a lot of merchants selling goods, fully well knowing a lot of rich people are around with money to spend. Enter Jospeh of A. Joseph of A came upon a merchant selling linens with the right dimensions that could be used as a head cloth and burial shroud and he bought them. If there would have been a plain weave white linen available quickly, I believe he would have got that instead. The herringbone twill must have been the best option at the moment. Fabric on Shroud and head cloth are same thickness, same threads per surface unit. Evidence the same weaver was at work on both cloths. Perhaps one being a table napkin, the other a table cloth, to be used for the Passover Meal. Instead they find a greater purpose. A different kind of lamb/meat was placed on the linen fabric that the weaver could not have foreseen in his/her wildest dreams. Obviously I believe The Shroud is authentic. I am going to stop here.

I want to note for the record immediately what I am posting is pure speculation. I would expect my theory to be ridiculed on this blog and not looked at seriously. I am not going to debate anyone on this blog about this subject. It is a speculative theory only. If I am proved wrong I have no problem standing up and saying “sorry I was wrong about that” Anyways here goes, I believe the Shroud was moved to the CALLIXTUS catacombs underneath Rome. I believe Peter himself brought it there and met with Paul of Tarsus and together they decided upon a place to store it. This is a place no one would expect it to be hidden and would be extremely difficult for enemies of the Christians to find because the catacombs go on for about 12 miles. There is a bunch of tombs down there, it would blend in perfectly with the motif. I believe there is reference to Shroud being moved to Rome in scripture and Paul of Tarsus gives Peter a code name, Carpus, because Peter was a fisherman. Carpus is Peter. In the letter he says he left a “The Shining Wrap” a “The Illuminated Shroud” with this guy and now he wants it brought to Rome Italy. He mentions Troas but I think he is referring to Constantinople or some other city so if his letter is intercepted by his enemies they will be looking for some guy in Troas named Carpus when in fact such a person does even exist. I believe the person who had this “Shining Wrap” is really Peter and he is not in Troas either, who knows what city he is really talking about. I believe at times Paul of Tarsus is anticipating some of his letters could be intercepted and is writing in codes, so that in the case his enemies intercept his letter, he is not giving valuable information out, like for example where the Mandylion/Shroud of Turin is located. He was the leader of the early christian movement, a highly intelligent person with good gift of foresightedness. Again, a lot of speculation here. Either The Shroud or another very good reproduction of it had to be in those catacombs at some point the early centuries to be able to do the frescoes. I believe The Shroud served as the role model to reproduce/ paint them. I believe this is also the reason there are microscopic traces of cinnabar and hematite on the cloth. I do not think it is out of line or crazy to believe that they must have had a good supply of cinnabar and or hematite in the tombs to be able to do all the frescoes and some traces of that organic material got onto the Shroud during the time it was in the catacombs. The red flecks Mc Crone (1980, 2000) claimed were hematite had an organic matrix (Heller 1983, Rogers 2004). It is interesting to note. That cinnabar was also used in ancient burials of high profile people, Lords and Queens and is associated with immortality and resurrection. The Maya culture believed that the color red was a symbol of death and second birth. The dead bodies had scraps of cinnabar, or red sulfide, laid on them to substitute pigment. As the color red was associated with death, corpses were sprinkled with the shavings of the red mineral cinnabar and were then wrapped in cotton for burial. They believed the person would then more easily reach the afterlife. (Sorry, that is a whole different subject) There is cinnabar on The Shroud and it possibly could have come from the catacombs or from people placing their paintings on The Shroud and even a combination of both things. I think part of the reason Rome converted to Christianity was because The Mandylion/Shroud was there. Part of the reason. Not all of it of course. Perhaps shown to groups of people at very carefully chosen times and then brought back to it’s hiding place in the tombs. I am clearly aware that this cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Not even close. Speculative theory only and some flimsy circumstantial evidence that supports, I am not the smartest guy, but not dumb enough to spend to much time on this or include it in my closing argument for authenticity. At least not yet, not without a bit more physical evidence and some scripture that supports it. There exists this possibility I am correct. My suspect is the Catacombs in Rome. We cannot eliminate my suspect. Often times the suspect who cannot be eliminated is the person responsible for the act. Perhaps we should bring my suspect in for questioning, and start probing into his past and see what we find. See if we can get a straight answer from him. Go into his cell phone records and bank accounts. Follow the money trail and see where it leads..","date":"2014-08-16","mins":"1:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/15/comment-promoted-looking-beyond-an-edessa-constantinople-route/","cat":"history","title":"Comment Promoted:  Looking Beyond an Edessa-Constantinople Route"},{"id":"comment-144157","author":"dave_hines","post":"Good Evening Mr. Charles Freeman, I guess I am not the only person wrapped up in the Shroud in the middle of the night.

I am in disagreement in how the word (κόμη) Paul wrote as being translated as long hair. I am correcting a error that was made in translation. That is all. :http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/definitionlookup?page=3&type=begin&target=greek&q=hair κόμη hair of the head This is one of the definitions that I studied and then I looked into other literature where the same word was used. Never was it used to describe long hair, κόμη is a dual noun which can have more than 1 meaning depending upon the sentence it is used in, it can even mean “unkempt hair” as it is used in later literature. This is a very obscure, seldom used word in connection with hair. This was another definition I copied and saved in which I cannot find the link to where it was found. (But I will find it) κόμη Fine hair, hair with comeliness With decorum, Ornament or splendor — beauty. Again, like I said the 1st clue Paul of Tarsus is not talking about long hair is in the 1st part of the passage Does not nature itself teach us that it is a shame for a man to have “long hair” κόμη What example in nature teaches us that? NONE. 1. A male lion with a long mane of hair, is that a shame? NO 2. A male horse with a long mane of hair, is that a shame? NO 3. A long flowing river, is that a shame? NO 4. Long branches on a tree, is that a shame? NO However if you decorate a lions hair with ornaments or a male horse it starts looking stupid. That is why Paul of Tarsus makes the connection with nature and artificial decoration as not belonging together. If Paul wanted to write long hair he would have used one of these words in ancient Greek that does mean long hair. Βαθυχαίτης Thick long hair ἐπικομάω To wear long hair καρηκομόωντες With hair on head, long haired κομάω To let the hair grow long κομήτης Wearing long hair μάλιον Long hair μάλιον Long hair, pig tail μακροκομέω Have long hair τανυέθειρα long haired τανύθριξ long haired, shaggy, ὑψιχαίτης long haired But he did not use those words, he used this, κόμη κόμη = Decorated/Ornamented Hair, This fits in the passage, long hair does not fit. The word is used twice in the passage. Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has (κόμη) ornamentally decorated hair it is a shame to him, but if a woman has (κόμη) ornamentally decorated hair it is a glory to her. See, how that fits. Paul of Tarsus is suggesting to the men not to come to the Church with hair that is ornamentally decorated. In his opinion it would not be appropriate/shameful. The only reason I am spending this much time on this subject is because it is brought up on my channel, over and over again. I am sick and tired of it. I get up to 1000 views a day on my Shroud videos. This is being used to plant seeds of doubt in the minds of people who are not yet decided in the authenticity of the Shroud. It is a small seed planted but it eventually grows into fear. Doubt + Uncertainty = Fear. That is what the other side is doing. This kind of misinformation spreads fear. If you are not convinced I have correctly translated this passage, launch your own personal investigation. That is what I tell people to do. The decision one makes in regards to the authenticity of The Shroud, could have eternal ramifications. That needs to be taken seriously. Sorry for such a long post. I want this cleared up once and for all.

Some of your past posts are extremely informative. I copied and pasted many of them and used them in my closing argument to help prove the authenticity of The Shroud. Especially some of the posts made in regards to the blood evidence. Thanks for making those posts. Anyways back to hair again At this point we can conclude beyond any reasonable doubt, Paul of Tarsus is not referring to just long hair. This is one of those deals where you have to start going through the process of elimination and cross off what is not possible and see what is left. (Whatever remains must be the answer) Anyways, These are some links and other commentary I found on the subject. 1. Http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.9:1:558.Autenrieth Georg Autenrieth [1891], A Homeric Dictionary for Schools and Colleges κόμη: hair of the head, with reference to comeliness 2. Book from Project Gutenberg: Döderlein’s Hand book of Latin Synonymes (κόμη) is especially applicable to the hair of females; +cæsaries+, to that of males, like ἔθειρα. This word ἔθειρ is defined as ἡ, hair, poet. Noun, Hom. Only in Il. , and always in pl., either of a horse’s mane, 8.42; or of the horsehair crest on helmets, This is more commentary I found on the subject 3. Paul also tells us it is not right for men to wear their hair in tresses. The word for decorate is mistranslated in the NKJV, where it is rendered as “long.” The word “long’ in verses 14 and 15 is the Greek word koma (κομᾷ). This word does not refer to long hair, but to “tresses of hair.” (Strong’s merely notes that the KJV renders this word as “long hair.” They do not give that definition themselves.) NT:2863 koma/komao (kom ah’ o); from NT:2864; to wear tresses of hair: KJV – have long hair. When we look up the reference at NT:2864 we see that it again speaks of tresses, and of ornamentally dressing (or plaiting) the hair. NT:2864 kome (kom’ ay); apparently from the same as NT:2865; the hair of the head (locks, as ornamental, and thus differing from NT:2359; which properly denotes merely the scalp): In other words, Paul told the Corinthian men that Hebrew men do not plait their hair, or wear them in locks, or trellises. He cannot have told them not to have long hair, because as we show in many other places, Paul took at least two Nazirite vows, which call for the hair of the head to grow long. Paul would not have told the Corinthians to avoid having long hair, when he himself probably had long hair at that time. What makes more sense, then, is to think that Paul was simply telling the Corinthian men to dress like men, and the women to dress like women. Finally, if we read this passage carefully, verse 16 tells us that the assemblies have no custom that sisters can pray or prophesy with their hair uncovered, simply because it is long, or trellised. To the contrary, the prettier it is, the more it needs to be covered; and if a sister does not wish to cover her hair wholly then she should be shaven or shorn, for to display her beauty openly in the assembly only serves to distract the men from focusing on the Spirit. 14 Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has decorated hair, it is a dishonor to him? 15 But if a woman has decorated hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering. 16 But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the assemblies of Elohim. I think of Paul of Tarsus is getting a good laugh out of all of this, perhaps providing some needed comic relief in the Kingdom of Heaven..","date":"2014-05-17","mins":"12:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/14/jesus-long-hair-again-and-again-and-again/","cat":"history","title":"Jesus’ Long Hair Again and Again and Again"},{"id":"comment-121300","author":"dave_hines","post":"Good Evening Mr. Hugh Farey: I found a few of the links we talked about and posted them.

It had dual purpose, outer garment and burial shroud. A Mantle also called a “Mandya” was typically used by someone in high position, as in a high priest, Jesus is the New High Priest and is a “Lion from the tribe of Judah” that is why they called it “The Mandylion” (Mandya, Lion) A Mantle by definition is a long, wide band of cloth, it cannot be just a face cloth. Elijah wore a mantle, coincidentally this was the only thing left behind after he ascended into heaven, then they sent the army out to search for him for 3 days, but did not find him. Only his “Shroud/Mantle” left behind. I believe it is a preceding event to what happens with Jesus. But like Daveb made clear it would be fairly easy to cast reasonable doubt into this passage (Timothy 2: 4:13)as being written in regards The Shroud. Without more physical evidence it is speculation. I like to speculate sometimes and combine a few facts to help shed more light into the subject, so here goes. It is clear The word, φαιλόνην is given a very vague and incomplete translation of “cloak” in 2 Timothy 4:13. We have to determine what the word cannot mean and see what is left. Cloak is eliminated as being possible.The spelling is completely wrong. Also eliminate traveling case, book case or chest. The word φαιλόνην is a dual feminine noun that means CLOAK and LIGHT. Derived from the Greek Word PHOS which means TO SHINE or make manifest, especially by rays. PHOS is also defined as being A HEAVENLY LIGHT such as surrounds angels when they appear on Earth. So the word φαιλόνην is combining HEAVENLY LIGHT WITH A CLOAK/SHROUD……….Why? It is noteworthy the word Paul wrote (or someone) “φαιλόνην” never appears again in the Bible or in any ancient scripture. It is a one of a kind word used to describe a one of kind thing. What could that one of a kind thing be……….? What could it not be. I believe The Shroud was brought to Rome with Peters permission. There is historical record he was there in the same time after the letter was written to Timothy. Highly valued relics were often hidden in catacombs to keep them from being destroyed by enemies of Christ in that time. The Turin Shroud/Burial Shroud Of Jesus would have been #1 on that list of things. The catacombs of Rome is a place no one would expect The Shroud to be kept hidden. The frescoes in the catacombs used the shroud face as a role model. At some point it had to be there. I often think Paul is writing anticipating the possibility that his letters could be intercepted by one of his many enemies and uses code words and is very careful and cunning in the words he chooses. In the case his letter is intercepted he is not disclosing any important names or locations Especially in regards to where the Shroud is kept. I think when he uses the name Carpus and names the location of Troas, it is a ruse,yet written in a way that Timothy will know what Paul really wants done, who to see and where. Coincidentally , Paul’s home town of Tarsus is extremely close to Edessa, Appx, 10 or 20 miles away. Of all the people that would have wanted to display The Shroud and prove his case, it would have been Paul. The word in question is , φαιλόνην, what is it? Because it is not just some ordinary cloak. The best and most simple translation of the word he used would be “A Illuminated Mantle/Shroud” Another mystery. Someday we will all know the answer.

People need to see to believe, that is just the way it is. I have to let you know upfront the videos I made were done over a year ago and I was a bit unrestrained and impatient in my narration.

If I could re edit and change them I would. I made a glaring error in my opening statement regarding the blood evidence not knowing that the rh factor of the blood was to degraded to know if it was AB pos or AB neg. There are some moments where I feel I misrepresented The Shroud. I am sure Barrie Schwortz would agree with that. I am working on correcting the errors I made in my presentation. Some of the evidence I presented is not scientifically peer reviewed. As a result I lose some credibility. I am aware of it. The videos get a lot of views. Over 100.000 views in the last year, reaching people in 194 countries. There are some highlight moments. I stopped promoting my book because I did not want it mixed in with The Shroud of Turin. So my channel is devoted to The Shroud. There is one video that translates a word that Paul of Tarsus used that I am convinced is referring to The Mandylion. I believe he was in possession of the Shroud and that it was moved to Rome into the callistus catacombs before 70 AD. I am reluctant to give you the link but since you asked I have to give it to you.

I have seen it used in other literature and it is never used to describe long hair. In fact it is NOT defined as long hair in any ancient Greek dictionary. It is such a obscure seldom used word that the translation varies from one dictionary to another. In one it is defined as “hair of the head” Another “hair with decorum” Another “tresses of hair” “Hair with comeliness/decorated” But never was the word Paul wrote, κόμη, translated as long hair in any ancient literature with the exception of the Bible. (If they knew the trouble it was going to cause I am sure they would have spent more time to accurately translate the word) Ancient Greek is a very sophisticated language, with many dual nouns and multiple adjectives and altered spelling of those nouns so as to know which adjective is being used. Millions of people to this day think Paul of Tarsus said it is a shame for man to have long hair WHEN THAT IS NOT WHAT HE SAID. HE SAID IT IS A SHAME FOR A MAN TO HAVE “TRESSES OF HAIR, ORNAMENTALLY DECORATED” As in how a woman dresses up her hair with flowers and/or jewels, for a public event or just for show. The word Paul used was translated as “long hair” but should have been translated as “tresses of hair, ornamentally decorated” or just “decorated hair” When you read the passage this way, it makes sense. Stop and look at the whole letter, this is more about the covering of women’s heads, not about men with long hair. The 1st clue that Paul of Tarsus is not saying it is a shame for a man to have long hair is in the 1st part of the passage. Does not nature itself teach you it is a shame for a man to have long hair? What example in nature teaches us that? NONE. There is no example in nature that teaches us it is a shame for a man to have long hair, NONE. Lets take a male lion for example with a long mane of hair, is that a shame to the lion? NO Or long branches on a tree, is that a shame to the tree? ABSOLUTELY NOT. But what does Paul mean? I will explain it further. Take a male lion and decorate it’s hair with flowers and jewels and dress up that male lion’s hair like a female, as in how a woman prepares her hair for a wedding or public event. Would that look like a shame to the male lion and dishonor him? A male lion with little decorated pink flowers in his hair, would that be a SHAME? YES it would. It would look ridiculous Lets read the whole passage the way Paul meant it so we can all understand. Does not nature itself teach you that it is a shame for a man to have tresses of hair, ornamentally decorated, but if a woman has tresses of hair ornamentally decorated it is a glory to her. SEE HOW THAT MAKES SENSE. For a woman to have tresses of hair ornamentally decorated looks good. For a man to come to the Church in Corinth with tresses of hair ornamentally decorated, in the opinion of Paul of Tarsus would be inappropriate/ shameful/ a dishonor That is all that he said. He went on to say at the end of the letter, But if any man seem to be contentious/argumentative we have no such custom, (or law against it) neither the churches of God. Saying this, If you want to come to the Church in Corinth with your hair ornamentally decorated we have no law against it. We suggest that you do not do it. That is all he said. Now what does this passage have to do with the Man in The Shroud/Jesus? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Paul of Tarsus took the Nazarite vow, meaning he himself had long hair. So why would Paul tell people not to have long hair, when he himself is speaking with LONG HAIR?! Because Paul of Tarsus did not say it was a shame for man to have long hair, but DECORATED HAIR. This is how it is spelled in ancient Greek, κόμη It is a very obscure, seldom used word that is difficult to translate because it has more than 1 meaning and can even mean “unkempt hair” It is understandable how this was mistranslated. BOTTOM LINE; The Man In The Shroud has long hair (look at the pony tail in the back) that means Jesus had long hair. The Man In The Shroud is Jesus. (His image captured on the linen anyway) Thanks for allowing me to post on this blog.

Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light” I do not believe The Shroud was kept hidden away in some dark chamber & not displayed because the disciples were so afraid of having it stolen or destroyed. That would prove they had spirits of fear and not of joy. The Lord would want The Shroud displayed. I am convinced Paul of Tarsus on various occasions displayed The Shroud in Rome and many other places. It was not his entire presentation, but part of it. I think Peter offered it to him. I don’t think he even needed to ask for it. He was the one out there more bold and fearless than anyone. Baptized in The Holy Spirit, a very convincing public speaker. Without physical evidence that directly links Jesus to the resurrection he would not have been successful in his ministry. Even if he could recite scripture from memory, heal the sick and perform miracles in front of people that does not prove Jesus rose from the dead. That proves he has special powers of God or that he was some kind sorcerer, doing things by the power of the Devil, that is how people would perceive that. He needs hardcore physical evidence such as The Shroud, to think otherwise is not logical nor practical thinking. To come to the conclusion Paul had the Shroud based only on that passage is also not logical. It is weak, I agree on that. We can conclude that the Shroud was in the open air in southern Turkey at some point in it’s history. It’s in the pollen evidence. It is a weak link but also supports the passage. The frescoes in the catacombs, that supports it. But we need a lot more. A writing by Paul in more detail, describing it. It is more important to believe The Shroud is physical evidence of the resurrection, not whether Paul displayed it or not. Either we are convinced or not convinced, .there is no in between, to harbor any kind of doubt means a person remains unconvinced. I suggest that if we truly believe The Shroud is physical evidence of the resurrection of Jesus to go directly and ask The Spirit of God personally if Paul of Tarsus was referring The Shroud in that passage. That would be my challenge to anyone that feels they must have the answer to that question. Its says “ask and you shall receive” in the Bible. I suggest to anyone in doubt to do just that. Anyways, I have really enjoyed reading your commentary on the Paul of Tarsus passage. We need more evidence before it starts looking convincing. Spirit of God will provide that evidence in his own time.

Instead of neatly tied back it was free flowing and dyed a blond color with jewels and ornaments/flowers hanging from it. Would people consider that inappropriate or shameful? Would it be out of place/ hurt his presentation? That is what κόμη is, ornamentally deocorated hair and Paul of Tarsus suggested for the men not to come to the Church in Corinth in such a way, then closed the subject by saying there was no law against doing it if one did it anyway.

The success of his ministry is dependent on it. A lot of pressure is on him. I believe is it useful to gain the deepest possible empathy with Paul of Tarsus and imagine ourselves having to give multiple presentations in front of several hundred people with the goal of proving Jesus of Nazareth rose from the dead. Imagine how difficult that would be. Imagine having to do it without a shred of physical evidence and trying to convince people based on here say testimony. In a way Paul of Tarsus is appointed defense attorney for Jesus, Imagine that being ourselves. Would we want to have The Shroud/The Mandylion to show to those people? As a defense attorney, would we want the cloth to show? It would be #1 on my list of things I would want for my presentation. I would to go to Peter and demand it. Otherwise I am going to be standing in front of thousands of people with nothing to show. Here say testimony. It would be a laughing disaster of a presentation. Not one person is going to be convinced. When I tell people I was baptized on the road to Damascus and I saw Jesus in a great white light I am going to be laughed off the podium. But when I bring out The Mandylion with over 400 blood stains on it and image of Jesus on it, the crowd goes silent. I can picture it. It’s convincing. I really like Max Patrick’s translation of the word Paul used “large shining wrap” I think it’s right. I think he was allowed to present it under Peters authority and permission. My theory is that it was kept in the catacombs of Rome throughout the early centuries and eventually moved back to Edessa after most of Rome was converted. Mission Accomplished. Without The Shroud being displayed, I don’t believe Paul could have proved his case beyond all reasonable doubt.

On this Paul of Tarsus passage we will have to agree to disagree. I am convinced Paul is referring to the Shroud, If explain in full detail why I am so convinced my mental health will be in question. So there is no point in discussing it. God willing I will open up the file on this again at a later date only if I have hardcore convincing evidence that supports it. It does not matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove and I cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the word Paul wrote is in reference to The Shroud. I am glad I did not include it in my closing argument. Now I know why. I can clearly see there are several different ways in which the display would be attacked and I have no doubt in my mind that no significant number of people would ever be convinced on the present evidence.

A good argument for why Paul of Tarsus would not risk displaying The Shroud & more reason Peter would be reluctant to let Paul be in possession of it let alone display it, (knowing Paul had to deal with daily threats and people seeking out to have him killed) ,Rome would be a risky place to display it in that time. I believe Paul of Tarsus is the kind of person that would do it anyway, the kind of person who walked that fine line between genuine courage and foolishness but not step across over the latter. I believe it was done under Peters authority and supervision. It may have even been the cause of his own demise, being crucified upside down. He was in Rome with Paul of Tarsus according to historical record. (Unless I am mistaken on that) I believe Paul had possession of it on at least one of his missionary journeys. He would have to choose his moment wisely under the guidance and counsel of The Holy Spirit in choosing a place, time or location to display it. I believe there were many occasions, if not most of the time he did not have it on his person, or display it. I believe the success of his ministry was more reliant on his charismatic, bold and fearless manner in which he gave testimony, his knowledge of scripture and how Jesus fulfilled them. A genuine leader who led by example more than just words. A real powerful speaker. Convincing & with the power of Holy Spirit with him to protect him &The Shroud if need be. Of course all of this is just speculation. I am not a authority or expert on the ministry of Paul of Tarsus. I am writing what I feel The Spirit of God wants written.

One thing about Shroud research is that it forces a person to go out of their normal comfort zone and actually have to start using that thing between our ears called the human brain. If one was to actually be in a courtroom style setting and this Paul of Tarsus passage was used as a display to authenticate The Shroud it would likely backfire, and actually even work in reverse. It could end up making the defense look desperate & lose credibility with a jury. I learned that from being on this Blog Site. I certainly did not foresee all the different angles from which the “evidence” would be attacked & how fairly easy reasonable doubt was cast into it. A good learning lesson. I am certainly not in disagreement with experience of the risen Lord being the force for character transformation of the apostles. From a spirit of fear, to fearless and bold. Amongst many other positive character traits of genuine humility. It is unfortunate in regards to the absence of historical record of The Shroud in written scripture and throughout the early centuries. Puzzling & thought provoking, another mystery to solve. One thing we could all agree on, “for the time being leave the Paul of Tarsus passage out of the defense display” It does not matter what we believe, it only matters what we can prove. Perhaps the good Lord will have a surprise discovery of some ancient scripture that will help further prove the authenticity of The Shroud beyond a reasonable doubt. Until then, we’ll have to leave the Paul of Tarsus passage in the evidence vault to be opened at a later date.

This is a bit of sidetrack type question but I was listening to Russ Breault;s theory has to how the image was formed on The Shroud and it sounded right. Hypothetically, if The Shroud image was formed by living cells in a body being electrified and each one emitted a micro thin laser beam, (short wave, high frequency) and the distance each one traveled was encoded into the linen, how many individual laser beams would be needed to form the entire Shroud image, front and dorsal? A ballpark estimate. 100,000? 1,000,000? Is there a way to get a semi accurate count by looking at a square inch of the image under magnification and then do the rest of the math based on that count?

How do you know that? I took a shower today in a vertical position. Maybe they stood the Man In The Shroud Up and poured myrrh and aloes over him. Aloes are made up of mostly water. Perhaps The Man in The Shroud got a final myrrh and aloes shower standing up. Maybe the mother of Jesus held the hand of her Son to say her final goodbye to him and a blood stain got smeared in a sideways or upward direction. Or while taking Jesus down from the cross a blood stain got moved in a sideways or upward direction. Like the one on his hand. That would be a pretty messy job. Any number of things could cause a blood stain to take a direction not going the way you think it should. Upwards, downwards, sideways, left or right.

Anyways, Here are the “Thoughts of God” on the subject of the Shroud of Turin In English Gematria (Numerical Clues Left Behind By The Spirit of God) Jesus of Nazareth = 1128 Shroud of Turin = 1128 It’s not a painting = 1128 It’s The Mandylion = 1128 Behold The Image of Edessa = 1128 A picture of Jesus = 1128 3 D Hologram of Jesus = 1128 3 D Hologram of The King = 1128 Israeli King Jesus = 1128 Beaten and Crucified Nude = 1128 Crown of Thorns = 1128 Right Side Pierced = 1128 Cruelly Scourged = 1128 A Brutal Scourging =1128 Legs not Fractured = 1128 There are many more, but I will add only 1 more to this list SHROUD IS GENUINE 1128 I can’t speak for anyone else on this Blog Site, but I am going with the math on this one. 1128 Shroud is Genuine. I suggest to others in doubt going with the 1128 combo. It is a number that keeps repeating itself. Exactly what a professional gambler looks for when wanting to make a rock solid pick. The same thing happening over and over again and never changes. Go with it. Over a 99% of winning. (I won a 7 team parlay on the spread in NFL Football using this strategy) The odds of probability and chance the following phrases listed all relating to The Shroud of Turin will have the same 4 number sequence is conservatively a 1 in 100 million chance. I would put a million cash on 1128 Shroud is genuine and not lose a second of sleep over it..","date":"2015-05-19","mins":"2:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"id":"comment-200091","author":"dave_hines","post":"Thank you Daveb for this post. Extremely well written. Insightful, thoughtful, helpful. There is feeling you get, deep down in your gut, in your solar plexus that lets you know when something is right or it is not, a gift granted to one from the Spirit of God, that lets one clearly make distinction between what is a paper rose and what is a genuine rose. The genuine bill or the counterfeit. But those harboring anger and contempt in their hearts do not possess this gift because the Spirit of God is repelled against their prideful nature. They don’t receive help from a Higher Power but from a Lower Power instead. An ancient and deceiving sick spirit, a fear based spirit and is a liar by nature. The Shroud is genuine, my heart, my mind, my body and my soul tells me so. The Forensic Science says it is genuine. This post is a voice of reason, of logic and genuine intelligence. There is no contempt or racial bias written in between the lines. One thing you cannot hide from a jury is anger and contempt. It shows in your body language and in your eyes. There are many who would declare the Shroud a forgery but in less than 60 seconds on the stand they would be discredited as a witness, regardless of their credentials because of racial bias. A good lawyer will immediately expose it and let the jury see it. Anger and hatred blind a person from the truth and negatively affects their judgement. Their testimony is not credible. History has taught us that. People can rip The Shroud apart on this site with the written word, but if they had to stand up in public and make their case it would be an all out complete and utter disaster. Add a video presentation to that as well. People are attracted to people that have joy in their spirit and have a desire to share that joy with others, to give it away freely, they are not attracted to the person with hidden anger and contempt toward Jesus Christ that launch character assassinations against credible witnesses with impeccable credentials, like for example Dr. Barbet, Dr. Bucklin, Dr. Zugibe, Dr. Adler, Dr, Ballone and I will include Dr. Max Frei the head of the forensic Science Police Department who I would put on the stand in a New York second if he was still alive and who made this statement to the press, “I can affirm without fear of being proven wrong, this linen cloth dates back to Palestine 2000 years ago” Dr. Max Frei (This statement got the attention of some very serious people who later set out to defraud the Shroud and assassinate his character and work) I decided to put the testimony of Jesus Christ on this site as a corroborating witness to Dr Max Frei’s testimony. And the skeptics can laugh all they want, but will not be able to find the clink in the armor of my witness who is an electro magnetic field sensor A scientific instrument who without racial bias who will record the testimony of Jesus Christ the Lord who will tell us all The Shroud is authentic, My witness has one sole purpose, to give testimony to the truth and that is exactly what everyone will see. My client who I am defending and who I have had a personal relationship with for over 40 years will testify now. Bear in mind, my client speaks in numbers. 1.Galileo Galilei ” Mathematics is the language that God wrote the universe in.” 2. PLATO “Numbers are the highest degree of knowledge, it is knowledge itself.” 3. Saint Augustine “Numbers are the thoughts of God” 4.Pythagoras “All is Number” No less than 1 million people in 211 countries will be seeing this. Spirit of God will make sure of that.

(Only 2 places in the world I could find had this in stock) There is no way any artist in their right mind would ever use this kind of fabric for a painting. For starters it would have to be stretched and put on a 14′ frame. One mistake made and you would have to purchase another 14′ piece and start over. But if you like we can begin the long insane list of things that one would have to do to replicate the Shroud image and literally get on the freight train going straight into crazy town. Step 1: I have the fabric Step 2 I need a genuine dead body that has been crucified… STOP… we are not going to crazy town. I highly suggest purchasing some pure linen herringbone twill fabric and applying pigment to it, Just so you can get an idea of how astronomically impossible it would be to replicate The Shroud image on this kind of fabric or any other by using paint, myrrh resin or any other medium for that matter. What this fabric would work better for would be a contact image. I’ll add one more thing this fabric could be used for, A holographic linen film plate… But it would have to be coated with something so that the laser light interference pattern of the object desired to be replicated could be seen on the linen. A thin layer of starch fractions and pectin might work. I wonder what kind of organic substance contains starch fractions and pectin ? How about myrrh & aloes? They contain starch fractions and pectin. Together they also have very similar chemical properties to cellulose acetate which is used on holographic film plates. I just told you in part how the Shroud image was formed.

One would certainly think a person excessively scourged to this degree would not be able to carry the cross on their own power. The Gospel account clearly states Jesus had to be helped by Simon of Cyrene. Forensic evidence and scripture match again. If this linen cloth was believed to have wrapped the King of Spain in 7th Century and 3 forensic pathologists examined the cloth and confirmed “Yes, a genuine dead body was wrapped in this cloth” NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON WOULD QUESTION IT. IT WOULD BE THE END OF THAT DISCUSSION. You yourself Charles would not question it. You would accept a dead body was wrapped in the linen. . Why then do you have trouble accepting what no less than 3 forensic pathologists have ruled in this case? When you watch Forensic Files do you question what the forensic pathologists rule in those cases? This does not have anything to do with Jesus does it? Oh, I think it does. Correct me if I am wrong. Since the name JESUS is involved with this linen we cannot accept what no less than 3 forensic pathologists have determined,. In between the lines of some of these posts, I am hearing “I hate Jesus” “I hate the Catholic Church” “I hate religion” It is not rocket science to determine if a genuine dead body was wrapped in a linen cloth or not. No less than 3 forensic experts concluded there was a genuine dead body wrapped in the Shroud If we applied the same harsh criteria we are inflicting upon the Man in The Shroud we would have to begin exhuming bodies from every graveyard in the world and re do the autopsy report. But not with just 1 pathologist, but with 7 or 9. It could take up to 10 years to complete the investigation on just one of the bodies exhumed and to make positive ID again. . How do we know that is a real dead body that was buried in the ground? That could be some kind of mannequin in that coffin and a insurance fraud took place. We need to evenly distribute justice across the board and give each person the same treatment we are giving the Man in The Shroud. People that have been convicted on circumstantial evidence need to be immediately released form prison, regardless of the offense, that would include pedophiles, child murderers, rapists, serial killers and every other sick thing you can possibly imagine and release them all back into society because “the skeptics aren’t convinced on the evidence” We need to start exhuming “dead bodies” from cemeteries (if those actually are dead bodies) and take a 2nd look and make sure there is an actual dead body in that coffin and not a mannequin or a convincing looking wax dummy look alike. Start looking into people bank accounts and insurance records.

Opinions vary but what counts in a court of law is the expert testimony. The jury will want to hear from the people that examined this “object” personally and have credentials. Like for example a battle field surgeon, Pierre Barbet. (A Doctor at Calvary) Chief Surgeon of St. Josephs Hospital who conducted a thorough examination of the Shroud and even went to the length of crucifying cadavers to aid in his forensic evaluation. Someone who has seen the horror of battle wounds. A serious minded person. Someone who has seen a lot of dead bodies up close and personal and who does this for living. At the very least the jury will want to hear the testimony of someone who has at least gone to medical school and holds a PHD in anatomy. Like Clint Eastwood said, “Opinion are like assholes, everyone has one” The jury does not want to hear opinions, but expert testimony. They will want to hear from expert forensic pathologists. They will want to review the testimony of Dr. Robert Bucklin and they will want to review the testimony of Dr. Frederick Zugibe, who does hold a PHD In Anatomy and was chief medical examiner of New York for 33 years. Dr. Robert Bucklin is a professor of forensic pathology and was directly or indirectly involved in up to 25,000 autopsies. In office for 50 years. Quite frankly I don’t give a crap if that was only 10,000 autopsies. The guy has seen a lot of dead bodies and knows the difference between what is a mannequin and what is a genuine person, between what is a painting and what is actual genuine human being. That is their job, to make that determination and they made that determination. A WRONGFUL DEATH TOOK PLACE!!! A genuine dead body was wrapped in that Shroud.and they are all in agreement on that. We have 3 expert witnesses that will testify the scourge wounds are genuine. Combined these 3 witnesses have been directly or indirectly involved in over 30,000 autopsies. Anyone out there think that their testimony is not credible? 1. Dr. Pierre Barbet 2. Dr. Robert Bucklin 3. Dr. Frederick Zugibe The non authenticity side can put up a 1000 witnesses that will say “the scourge wounds don’t look credible” But it means nothing, A worthless opinion. You would be hard pressed to find one that actually even saw the Shroud of Turin. Amazing, declaring something a fraud without even having seen it. There is no jury in the world that would take the testimony of such a person with any degree of seriousness. They don’t look credible to the skeptic because they don’t want them to be credible. Even if they are credible they are not credible. Alrighty then. ALL 3 forensic experts have concluded beyond any doubt that a dead man in his 30’s approximately 5’11” with long hair, beard and mustache was 1. Beaten 2. Scourged 3. Crowned With Thorns 4. Crucified 5. Side Pierced 6. Legs Not Broken 7. Wrapped in the Clean Linen Cloth 8. Body Separated From Cloth Before Decomposition Set In When numerous pieces of physical evidence match the sequence of events recorded in the historical record it makes it possible to accurately calculate odds of probability and chance.Only One Person we know of in recorded history has undergone this sequence of events. There is 1 chance in 82,944,000 that the man buried in the Shroud is not Jesus on this alone. Take a look at that again. The calculated odds all these match points are coincidental but the cloth did not make contact with Jesus is 1 in 82 MILLION, 944 THOUSAND. That is the bottom end lowest figure not taking into account a dead corpse by random happenstance and incredible luck left distance information on the Shroud and holographic info as a result of making contact with the linen! The numbers don’t lie. The Man In The Shroud is Jesus There is no reasonable doubt in that. To be in disagreement one would have to be in disagreement with the testimony of Dr. Pierre Barbet, Dr. Robert Bucklin and Dr. Frederick Zugibe And the skeptics are in disagreement with the ruling they made. I personally think they are flat out insane, suffering inside with some kind of sick ailment. To rule against the expert testimony is insane. Insanity = 666 in English Gematria. The number of the skeptic is 666. They are reduced to character assassination against expert witnesses so that their “pet paint or contact image theory” works. Bottom line, we either accept or don’t accept expert witness testimony I accept it. ..","date":"2015-05-17","mins":"4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"id":"comment-199714","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello Charles, go ahead and post some of these photos you are referring to here on this site. I am a artist, I have seen and done a lot of paintings. That is how I got involved with the Shroud going through a google search of every painting and art work ever done of Jesus. If there is something you have I have not seen please post it, I will look at it. I have never seen any work of the old masters or any other artist for that matter that painted something that looked like a authentic human being. I can tell it is a painting within seconds of looking at, but that was not the case when I saw the Shroud the 1st time. It did not look like a painting at all. My 1st impression of the Shroud was “it looks authentic but it cannot be authentic” I was absolutely not convinced the Shroud was genuine when I saw it. I thought it was a 19th century photograph. Any forensic pathologist would be thinking the same before seeing The Shroud, “there is no way this is the genuine thing” fully expecting to take a quick look and then get back to taking care of genuine human patients. For starters the fabric does not look like 1 ST Century, blood stains are red, there is a image on the cloth, that would make any forensic pathologist immediately think it is not genuine. Corpses do not leave complete images behind on linens, only blood stains and perhaps some vague imprints of the body. But, Obviously something got their attention that turned them around or they would not have written books and had their whole lives turned upside down because of their involvement with the Shroud. My own life has been completely turned upside down because of it. It inspired me to write and publish a book and I am not a author. I get 500 to 1000 views a day in 211 different countries. On the Shroud videos i make. Over 300,000 views in short time. My whole llfe has been completely changed because of the Shroud of Turin.

There would only be a dispute if all 3 were not in agreement. Of course they would not assume a dead body made contact with the cloth before examining it. A professional pathologist would never assume anything until examining the evidence left on the linen. There have been cases tried without a body but a wrongful death was still proven beyond a reasonable doubt because of trace physical evidence left behind by the victim on clothing, linens, carpet fibers, ect. It is not common but there are many such cases. Note in my comment a name was never attached to the linen cloth. The only job of the forensic pathologists in the case scenario I laid out was to determine if a genuine dead body made contact with the cloth. That is all. Not to attempt to make positive ID on the body. If the Shroud of Turin did not have a name associated with it, and was called “The shroud of some unknown dead man” and the linen was given to 3 forensic pathologists to determine if a genuine dead body actually made contact with the linen and the name of Jesus was completely taken out of the picture no one would dispute their finding. If after a thorough examination all 3 agreed that indeed the cloth did make contact a genuine dead body “but we have no idea who the person is” NO ONE WOULD DISPUTE THE FINDINGS OR THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN BY THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. No one would say, “I am not convinced, let’s have 20 other pathologists look at that linen”: .But add the name Jesus to it, and all hell breaks loose. Now the medical professionals with impeccable credentials and successful careers just became incompetent fools and liars. Look at the comments here just about the scourge wounds. Look at what the skeptics did to Dr. Max Frei, head of the forensic police department, they accused of him of manufacturing evidence and being incompetent. Still going on to this day because he stood up for Jesus. I saw him give testimony, he was a very credible witness, did not come across incompetent or dishonest in any way. An excellent witness, a shame he passed away before his work could be finished. If these wounds belonged to someone else, and 3 different forensic pathologists all agreed they were genuine.

I believe this is where Jesus was laid. I believe the attention of Joseph of A and Nicodemus was diverted from the body of Jesus to making the grave big enough for Jesus, causing further time delay and less attention to the body of Jesus. I believe a mixture of the myrrh and aloes were simply poured over the entire body to “purify the body” but the blood stains left as they were. I also believe the linen cloth itself was submerged in the solution of myrrh and aloes and is responsible for the thin layer of starch fractions and pectin that Ray Rodgers claims is there. Myrrh and aloes and starch fractions and pectin have the same sugars and chemical properties. Myrrh resin would also preserve the blood stains and they would remain red as a result. My theory only. I can test it. I will put fresh blood on the pure linen herringbone weave cloth I just bought and then apply myrrh resin and see what happens. I have the cloth, I just need some fresh blood to apply to it and then the myrrh. I have some pure myrrh resin from Egypt I just purchased. It is 100% pure. High Quality.

Iron pigment, no matter how thin the mixture, will produce a specific spectral signature that is not present on the Shroud in the image areas, or anywhere else on the Shroud, in sufficient total area of presence to cause formation of the image. Iron pigment, when evenly surface illuminated, would produce the same reflectance response, thus producing a flat elevation on the VP 8 isometric display. This result is not observed on the Shroud. Iron pigment is more reflective than transparent. When an iron pigment is exposed to light, more photons will be reflected than will pass through the iron pigment to the other side. Some photons will be absorbed. Therefore, if an iron pigment image is lit from behind, it will “block” (absorb and reflect) more of the light than it will allow to pass to the other side. This would result in a much higher contrast photograph of the iron pigment image. However, when illuminated from behind, the Shroud image is not clearly visible. It is not discernable. The “dabbing process”, and the “iron pigment theory”, are posed together as a definitive conclusion on the “trickery” side of the “explanations pile”. Simple results of simple tests, such as back lighting the image, prove such theories are incorrect. More complex tests also prove they are incorrect. Microscope examinations of the threads shows no pigment, no binders, no “bleeding of chemicals” between fibers, and no fiber discoloration to match iron pigment. Spectral response tests prove there is no “signature” at the appropriate wavelengths for iron pigment reflection. And, density slicing tests do not show large areas of even illumination indicating pigments and binders in the Shroud image area. Yet, such “theories” are published as fact, in spite of the many test results proving it cannot be so..","date":"2014-09-27","mins":"10:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"id":"comment-157341","author":"dave_hines","post":"This is another note able quote on the subject.

GENUINE ANCIENT RELIC =1128 There has been criticism of me presenting this as evidence that supports the “Shroud is Genuine” (1128) and that’s alright. Let them say what they want. I am in good company when I present mathematical evidence the Shroud is authentic 1.Galileo “Mathematics is the language that God wrote the universe in.” 2.Plato ” Numbers are the highest degree of knowledge, it is knowledge itself.” 3.Saint Augustine “Numbers are the thoughts of God.” My Math display at first seems coincidental but when you add 99 more coincidences to this evidence all saying the same thing and pointing to the same person it starts getting very powerful and compelling.

Look at how these names, phrases and words all fit in with each other and all equal the same number. GENUINE ANCIENT RELIC= 1128 SHROUD OF TURIN=1128 SHROUD IS GENUINE=1128 SHROUD OF THE LORD=1128 NAMED JESUS CHRIST=1128 JESUS OF NAZARETH=1128 SON OF GOD 3 D HOLOGRAM=1128 A SACRED WINDING SHEET=1128 JESUS INSIDE A GRAVE=1128 CLOTH IMAGE OF JESUS=1128 A PICTURE OF JESUS=1128 RISEN LORD JESUS=1128 The following 12 words/phrases listed could be referred to as DATA, In philosophy data is defined as “things known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculation” That said I will add one more phrase to the list. DATA IS NOT A COINCIDENCE=1128 I can add another dozen to this list equally compelling. The English Gematria Calculator is definitely not lingering in doubt in regards to the authenticity of the Shroud. The greatest thing about this witness is that he does not respond negatively to character assassination and could care less what one thinks of his testimony, has no emotions, no feelings and could care less whether The Shroud is authentic or not. Rock Solid Truthful Testimony. We’ll close this post with a quote from Pythagoras “ALL IS NUMBER”.","date":"2015-08-13","mins":"1:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/the-shroud-is-a-holograph/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Shroud is a Holograph?"},{"id":"comment-206326","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hi Hugh: I do know how a hologram is made because I made these images with a hologram machine. I set up the laser and did it. I sat and watched and observed like any good scientist. Made images with object up close to film plate and farther away and made notes. You do not need to 2 lasers or a beam splitter to create a hologram. No mirrors, nothing like that. Only 1 laser is needed with the beam expanded. That is all. The one beam lights the subject and film plate at the same time. Both a transmission hologram and a reflection hologram can be made with a single laser, without use of a beam splitter or any mirrors. I know because I did it and saw it. The images in this video were created without use of mirrors or beam splitter, only a single laser with expanded beam. Hologram images in this video are 1/50th the thickness of a human hair. There are different types of emulsions used to coat a holographic film plate. One of them is tri acetate, (cellulose acetate) Other types of emulsions could result in a image thicker than 1/50th thickness of a human hair. Myrrh and aloes have the same chemical properties as cellulose acetate. Acetate fabric could be used to record an interference pattern. I just bought some. Only a place in the world I could find still makes it. I just moved to Central America or I would write more.

Interesting. Thanks for taking your personal time to write that reply. One’s Time is valuable gift. Thanks for the gift of your time. I am going to go off topic for a second then we’ll get back to the match points/similarities I made between a holographic image and the Shroud Image. I estimate your IQ on a low end to be 120, on a high end 140. Best Estimate 130. Let me know how close I came. My point. You are to smart to believe The Shroud is a painting. It is completely out of place with your character. It does not fit. If you owned a car lot, it would likely be full of Jaguars, Mercedes, BMW’s, Lamborghini’s and Ferrari’s. Your stating you believe The Shroud is a faded painting would be like you having a old beat up Ford Pinto in the midst of your luxury cars for sale. It doesn’t fit. Sometimes I think you are paid to plant seeds of doubt into the authenticity of The Shroud. Like a paid job. I also believe in innocent until proven guilty. Please correct if I am wrong. Are you paid to plant seeds of doubt into the authenticity of the Shroud? If I was in a high authority position with a lot to lose in a financial sense if the Shroud was authenticated I would be looking for someone like you to put stumbling blocks in front of people and steer them in the opposite direction. “to keep business as usual” You can take the 5th amendment on that question. I am not asking this in a disrespectful manner. As a defense lawyer for my client, The Man In The Shroud/Jesus, it is my job to do this and ask these types of questions. In order to defend my client I have to gain empathy with those who set out to scourge and crucify him again. If I don’t ask these types of questions I do my client a dis service. No offense to you was intended. It is my job. I am not paid to do it. Pro bono work. Lets go back to the beginning. 1. Holographic info on the film plate is 1/50th the thickness of a human hair. That info comes from the corporation that made the holography equipment. I did not just make that up. You wrote “The thickness of a thick human hair is about 160um, the thickness of the enamel on a hologram about 8um, the thickness of the image on the Shroud is about 0.002um” Holographic images fade over time and lose some of their holographic qualities. So has the Shroud. So the Shroud image at one time was 8um and now it is only .002um. That is what one would expect after almost 2000 years. 2. Resolution of a Holographic Image and The Shroud image are very close. Nothing out of place there. 3. Laser light diffracted will have constructive and deconstructive waves. Colored and uncolored areas on film plate/linen would be the result. What is actually only 3 D information could be falsely perceived as being distance information when it is actually not. 4. Holographic image on linen when viewed from the back would not be visible. Shroud image is not visible from back. Ray Rodgers believed the image was within the thin coating on the fabric, not on the fabric. I believe he was right. 5. The body of Jesus is the light source, eliminating the need to bounce a laser beam off the object. The object is the laser beam. Laser light was expanded & diffracted, interference pattern was recorded on linen. Subject was close to linen. 6. Eye witness testimony states the image does fade and vanish when viewed from the far left and far right. Photos and paintings and simple contact images do not do that. 7. Shroud image is a single color, Laser light is a single color, and a interference pattern of laser light would result in leaving some areas colored and others not. Match again. 8. Exactly how close body was to cloth at time of image formation is not known. I noted that when the object being replicated was past 5cm there was no image formation. I do not believe that was another coincidental match. In the early centuries the Shroud was called “the Image of Edessa, the image not made by human hands” Then then there is the famous quote from Constantinople, “The image is extremely faint, more like a moist secretion, without pigment or the painters art” Why were they so convinced this was not a painting? What made it stand out so much apart from all other images? An English Gematria Calculator is my corroborating witness that will answer that question. First 3 D Hologram Made = 1128 3 D Hologram on a Mantle=1128 Son of God 3 D Hologram=1128 Shroud of Turin = 1128 Jesus of Nazareth= 1128 Behold the Image of Edessa =1128 Its not a painting=1128 No one had ever seen a hologram on linen before. It has not even been done in this day and age…yet..","date":"2015-07-23","mins":"1:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/the-shroud-is-a-holograph/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Shroud is a Holograph?"},{"id":"comment-206491","author":"dave_hines","post":"Muy buenas tardes Antero de Frias Moreira! ¿Puede hablar a español? Apenas llegué aquí en mi casa de vacaciones en costa rica, ¿qué país provienen? No dude en escribirme en Español Si quieres. Ya que escribo mejor en ingles y también tiene buen inglés permite probar ese idioma. Another coincidence that is noteworthy is that human DNA oscillates at a few billion cycles per second and emits a weak laser like light in the UV range, each time it contracts, it releases 1 photon of UV Light. That is appx a few billion photons per second. What if that process was amplified by someone who knew how to manipulate it? Like The Creator of DNA for example. I would like to see the Shroud myself on a flat piece of glass standing upright in a dark room with light coming from only 1 direction straight on and then tilt the image to the far left and then far right, up and down. According to the person who examined The Shroud in a similar manner, he stated the image vanished when going to the far left or far right and at one angle it appeared as if the body/image came out of the sheet. That is exactly what a hologram does. There is a specific angle when titled to the right or left where the object appears to come right up out of the glass. A extremely unique optical illusion. It is a very specific angle this occurs at and is very hard to hold the moment. The slightest shift or movement any way and it will vanish. I filmed such a moment in this video. Thanks for the link you provided, I will read it again. I have seen it. Lets make a list of “coincidences” 1. Shroud image is extremely superficial. Hologram image extremely superficial 2. Shroud image not visible back lit. Hologram image not visible from back side 3. Shroud image is one color Hologram image is one color 4. Shroud image consists of colored fibers and uncolored Hologram image is the same Laser light diffracted off an object will result in constructive and destructive wave patterns, on a piece of linen this would result in coloration of some fibers and others not. This could only be observed to be true only when viewing the interference pattern under a microscope or put under a VP analyzer. Shroud of Turin has such info encoded into the linen. 5. Shroud image becomes vague or vanishes when viewed from far left or far right Hologram image is the same. (According to eye witness testimony, not myself personally) 6. Shroud image at a specific angle appears to come out of the sheet. Hologram is the same 7. Shroud image has very good resolution. Hologram image has very good resolution. 8. Shroud image is faded and getting weaker. Hologram image fades over time. It is not illogical to conclude Shroud image is the result of a interference patter of light. Very focused light of a single wave length. Where the theory starts going south is when it is explained the body is the light source. This has never been observed in Science. Also during the process of making a hologram there can be no sound vibration. Object must be 100% static. Cloth must also be 100% static. Interference pattern is easily disrupted resulting in no image at all. Those are things I cannot explain other than to say the person/intelligent force in charge image making process has the ability to place a electromagnetic field around a cloth and body and hold it in place and or create a zero gravity environment during image process. And make sure there are no sound interruptions during the image process. A tall order, only a “Higher Power Intelligence/God would be capable of filling. Gracias por responder a mi post.

I asked a question. It is my job to do that. I could be wrong. I am open to that possibility. In the same way I was open to the possibility that the Shroud of Turn actually made contact with the body of Jesus and is physical evidence of his resurrection. Of which when I 1st saw the Shroud I thought the odds of probability and chance the Turin Shroud actually made contact with the body of Jesus was at best a 1% chance of being possible. But I will still open to the possibility. Extremely improbable and unlikely, but possible. My investigation started at that point in 2009. “not convinced” I wrote “I estimate your IQ on a low end to be 120, on a high end 140. Best Estimate 130” That is a compliment. Only about 2.3% of the population scores 130 or more on a IQ test. I put you in the range of “extremely gifted, talented, above average intelligence” Einstein scored 150 or 160, I cannot recall which is the correct figure, but it was high. You are in his range. Based on your extremely high level of intelligence it is out of place for you to believe The Shroud is a painting. It is in complete disagreement with the forensic evidence. I have many times been accused of trying to cash in on the Lord’s sacrifice because I wrote a book. When asked if money is the motive behind my work, I answer the question. Because this happened so frequently I stopped promoting my book. Never include it in my videos even though I reach 500 to 1000 people a day. That is like committing professional suicide. My publisher thinks I am insane not to capitalize on it. When I am asked about my book I give it away for free at my own cost. Spirit of God rewards me in ways that words cannot adequately describe. Gifts more valuable than gold. Your posts are Extremely informative. Thoughtful, intelligent. Well written. On a closing note I suggest only that you be more open minded to the possibility that the Shroud is genuine. If I was not 100% convinced the Shroud was authentic I would not bother posting or ever make any statement regarding the Shroud. Convinced or not, there is no in between. At some point a decision needs to be made, “to cut off from any other possibility” Spirit of Gods needs a person without doubt, bold and fearless to represent him. Like Paul of Tarsus. Without fear and without doubt. I have no doubt in my heart, mind, body or soul in regards to the authenticity of the Shroud. 100% convinced. It was in 2012 when that happened.

Good middle of the night is perhaps more appropriate? I was more than open minded was the Shroud was not authentic. At the beginning I was 99% convinced it was not a cloth that made contact with Jesus. My idea of the burial cloth of Jesus would be more like a very old fabric in poor condition with only blood stains on it and nothing else. No image. How I got convinced the other way? That is a long story. For the last 7 years I have been getting up every morning and saying the same prayer. A scientific experiment to find out this, “Is there a Higher Power/God or not?” Part of it goes something like this “Lord grant me that I am not so much seeking to be loved, consoled or understood, but to love, console and understand others. Lord your will be done, not mine, guide me in thought and action toward that, and grant me the power to carry it through today” The results of this on going experiment have been astounding. I would be writing for next month straight to make a list of all the events that have occurred over this time. Many were documented and put into a book I wrote. I am not author, I never wanted to be one. I sold real estate and I was a percussionist in a rock band. I was a personal trainer. Heavy into bodybuilding and going to night clubs and drinking every night. The Shroud of Turin was about the last thing on this Earth I saw myself ever getting involved with. Many times over these last 7 years I have seen up close and personal physical evidence of the Spirit of God in my life. It has been proven to me beyond any doubt such a “Higher Power/God” does indeed exist. I am convinced and I am not easily convinced. It is a requirement of the Spirit of God that I attempt to gain empathy with others. That involves having to ask questions to so that I can gain that understanding and empathy with that person. It is my duty/job/obligation to do so. I did not say I was good at it. I believe if one aspires to be a true scientist that person must be open minded to the possibility that Jesus rose from the dead and the Shroud is physical evidence of that event, if not, it would be not unlike a defendant walking into a courtroom and the possibility that he or she is innocent is not even considered a possibility. God forbid anyone be guilty of that. We have all seen unsolved murder cases where the forensic evidence told a highly improbable unbelievable story. One that comes to mind is a case where the forensic evidence and the pathologists report told a story of 2 parents that held down their daughter and stabbed her to death. The parents story was that their daughter demanded $5,000 and attacked them with a knife. It would be very difficult for a jury to accept the forensic evidence side of the story. Difficult for one to imagine holding down your own daughter and plunging a knife into her chest cavity 7 times. It turned out the FBI suspected one of the parents was a terrorist and the house was wired. They went back and listened to the tape. The entire event was caught on audio The unbelievable story turned out to be exactly what the forensic evidence says happened. The Parents held down their daughter and plunged a knife into her while she begged and screamed for them to spare her life. They did not like the boy she was dating. He was black. That was the reason. She never demanded any money, never had any weapon. The parents even stabbed themselves to make it look like they were in a fight Perhaps not a good comparison story that relates to the Shroud, but the point is the forensic evidence on the Shroud tells a tale of a extremely improbable event, one many people would have difficulty accepting or believing. What is the forensic evidence on the Shroud telling us? What does the pathologists report say happened? What is the VP 8 analyzer telling us?.","date":"2015-07-25","mins":"9:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/the-shroud-is-a-holograph/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Shroud is a Holograph?"},{"id":"comment-206559","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello Daveb of Wellington: I always enjoy reading your posts.

I made this video because I wanted to document where I am at this time. I felt a strong need to do so. “If life is worth living it is worth recording” To say the Shroud image is the result of a interference pattern of laser like light is not a complete explanation.

All of them. When typing in the word “perfect” in a google search does it go to crazy, sexy or bi polar? NO. Those are 4 unrelated things that coincidentally have the same number, The acid test to make this determination is to put the word/phrase in a google search and see where it goes. Do they all go the same thing/subject? When A body of evidence is collected at a crime scene it also goes through a process of scrutiny to determine what items collected are related to the crime and what is not related. To separate “the wheat from the tares” A good example is the one you listed Which of the following does not fit in with the rest of the group? 1.Mark of Beast 2. Demonic Evil 3.The Eden Snake 4.Satan’s Seal 5. Dan Porter When typing in the name Dan Porter on a google search does it go to Satan or things relating to the Devil? No. What about the others? mark of beast, demonic evil, satan’s seal, Are they related? Yes. There is nothing in the character of Dan that would suggest any connection to a supernatural evil force. His name is obviously out of place. Thus that piece of evidence collected is not part of the “main body of evidence” and is put aside and disregarded. Another example: Evidence collected at a crime scene Which of the following pieces of evidence collected a crime scene in which the victim was shot and stabbed to death does not fit in with the rest of the group. A. Gun b knife c. Bloody clothes d Shell casings e Deck of playing cards (no prints found or DNA collected from cards) The acid test to know if there is a connection are things with the same number that are also related to each other. Past 7 matches is where it gets a little attention. Past 12 (A number of completeness) is where it get’s more compelling. Many of the matches I found were done on the 1st try. “Genuine Ancient Relic” is one of many among that list. “Shroud is Genuine” is another, There are over 50 words/phrases that relate to the Shroud and Jesus with the same number. Each one of them when typed into a google search go directly to Jesus or the Shroud or both. You would be hard pressed to find 12 words/phrases with the same number that directly relate to the chosen person, place or thing. Jesus and The Shroud and words/phrases relating to Jesus and The Shroud at 1128 may have the most match points of any word in the English language. Over 50! I believe is noteworthy. Messages/clues left behind by the Spirit of God, Spirit of God will let one know and help each person seeking his will to be able to make clear distinction between what is genuine and what is falsely perceived. To know intuitively and or by sight, feel, or touch, or smell what is genuine or not. What is a paper rose and what is a genuine rose. Who is lying and who is not. What is a good purchase and what is not. A guide, and counselor. Spirit of God tells me these match points are not a coincidence. My Point Is: This is not just about finding things with the same number, but things with the same number that are related to each other. By itself this Gematria display does not hold much weight, it belongs with the rest of the body of evidence.

Light source comes from an angle from above and goes through film plate 1st. Object is behind film plate. A transmission hologram is different. Light hits object 1st then the film plate. Direction of light is not at a angle but straight on in a transmission hologram. The laser beam is split/expanded because the lens is removed illuminating both object and film plate. Could DNA emit a expanded beam of laser light that would result in diffraction when being emitted from human body resulting in a interference pattern? Possible. If we aspire to be great forensic detectives we need to have expansive thinking and consider all possibilities In a transmission hologram object can be further away film plate and still record a interference pattern. I am not sure why that is so. All that would be required to create a interference on the linen would be for the laser light coming from DNA to be diffracted. This is another case where the forensic evidence tells a highly improbable incredible story, very difficult to accept or believe. This has never been observed in Science. For one to not to accept it, is completely understandable. I am not anticipating many will. Also noteworthy in a hologram is that you cannot over expose the film that I am using. It takes about 5 minutes to create a hologram with my equipment. If I over expose the object to the light, it makes no difference. I could leave it on for 1 hour if I wanted. In fact it can even help make a better image. But unlike photography there is no danger of over exposure. Of course in a hologram a laser is bounced off the object, but in the case of the Man in the shroud, he becomes the laser eliminating the need to bounce a laser off him from another source To offer a theory that laser light coming from DNA is diffracted and a interference pattern is created as a result is certainly not stretching the imagination that far. DNA does emit laser like light in the UV Range. That is a scientific fact, not a theory. But that process would need to be amplified and controlled. It would require the original creator of the DNA to be involved in The Shroud image process to pull off such an incredible feat. One who has detailed knowledge of what DNA is capable of doing. I would describe such a person as a “Higher Power Intelligence/God”.","date":"2015-07-26","mins":"10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/the-shroud-is-a-holograph/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Shroud is a Holograph?"},{"id":"comment-208188","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello Hugh: An example of debunking Gematria and replicating “my painting of words” would involve choosing a famous person, place, or thing with a rich source of words associated/related to it. As rich a source of words that could possibly be. For Example Led Zeppelin is a famous group with many words associated to them. Led Zeppelin =744 Peter Grant=744 If I type in Peter Grant on google, Led Zeppelin will also come up, they are related. Those are 2. 12 are needed. Only 10 more needed to debunk my evidence as not genuine. How hard can that be? Should be easy to do. Yet it is not. I could not find any more. If I tried harder I think I could come up with a few more. If this was random good luck and coincidence I should be able to type in names of the group, songs they wrote and at least one of them should come to 744 by random happenstance. I am sure there is a better example than Led Zeppelin. I am sure you get the idea. It is not as easy as you would think. In a unsolved murder case there is often coincidental evidence that links a suspect to a crime. In the cases where there are only a few coincidences that link a suspect to the crime it often turns out the suspect is not guilty and was not involved. However, in cases where coincidences add up past 7 things, I have never seen a case where that suspect was actually not involved and the 7 coincidences linking the suspect to the crime were coincidence only. Numbers that repeat themselves over and over again always get the attention of a good forensic detective and or a professional handicapper. If I claimed to be a mind reader and asked a person to pull a random card out of the deck and repeat that card to themselves in silence and I told that person what card they were thinking of on the 1st try, does that mean I am a mind reader? No, that could happen by random coincidence, a lucky guess. A coincidence. Yes there are coincidences. But what if I did it 7 times in a row? People would think I am receiving information either by trickery or by a higher power intelligence.

Laser light will travel in the direction the laser is pointed at. A single wavelength, a single color. Shroud is a single color. When one tries to imagine a artist doing a painting, at the very least one would think to at least color the hair brown, not straw yellow. Having myself done no less than 100 portraits I cannot in my wildest imagination ever conceive of myself or any artist doing a 14′ Jesus painting and use only 1 color?! Extremely out of place. You wrote “If Jesus were suspended between the top and bottom halves of the linen, the front of His body would have emitted light vertically upward, producing the frontal image on the Shroud and the back of His body would have emitted light vertically downward, producing the dorsal image” Yes, laser light could produce that effect. Not only vertically, or horizontally, but any direction, any angle. I will add a scientific fact to this that may shed some light (no pun intended) to how the Shroud image was formed. DNA produces a weak laser like light in the UV range. A few billion cycles per second. With each contraction a photon of light is produced. What if that process was amplified… Could it result in laser like light coming out of a body? Yes, it could, it is possible, however improbable as that might sound, it is possible. . In the same way a painting is not done in a single moment we cannot assume the Shroud image occurred in a single moment just because light is involved. Image could have been formed in sections, one part at a time. Not lasers firing off all at the same moment, but in systematic sequence. Starting from one point of the body until the entire body was replicated on both film plates, the Shroud linen in this case. I have a hologram machine set up in my room right now. I can make either A. A transmission hologram B. A reflection hologram There is another called a white light transmission hologram which I am not set up to make. In a reflection hologram the object is behind the film plate, in a transmission hologram the object is in front of the film plate. Shroud image would be more of a white light transmission type hologram Only a single laser was used to make the hologram in this video with the beam expanded. No mirrors, no beam splitter. A single laser can serve both to illuminate the object and the film plate at the same time. It is not as complex as a procedure as one might think. When one thinks of a making a hologram they think of needing a beam splitter and use of mirrors. It is not true. When a hologram is made it records a microscopic pattern of bright and dark lines due to the interference pattern of light. When light is passed through the hologram the light diffracts off the captured pattern, bending the light to look like the original object. When a laser beam is expanded and the light is seen on a solid black surface it appears as tiny dots of light, not unlike the tiny dots on a television screen. A hologram records the intensity of light and the direction it was traveling when it hit the film plate. Object must be extremely close to film plate to record a interference pattern. At least with the equipment I am using. I am not a expert in holography but I do know how to make one and have observed and watched the film plate in a dark room during the image process and have experimented with object being replicated close to film plate and farther away. After object being replicated is even a short distance from film plate there is longer image formation. Object must be close to film plate, which in the case of the Shroud would be body of Jesus When 2 waves come together, such as 2 waves from 2 beams of laser light or a single laser with the beam expanded the combine to make one wave pattern. If the peak of one wave combines with the peak of another you get a wave twice as big, this is called constructive interference. If the peak of one wave combines with the valley of another you get no wave at all. This is called destructive interference. If this same process occurred on The Shroud linen it would result in some fibers colored and others. This is exactly what we see on the Shroud of Turin. Some fibers colored others not. A interference pattern. Colored vs uncolored fibers. The colored and uncolored fibers on the Shroud show up in a VP 8 analyzer as accurate 3 D info, To offer a theory this happened by random happenstance or coincidence is not logical. It would be not unlike a person wining the lottery every time they play and one saying it is just random good luck and incredible coincidence. “No higher power intelligence was involved or advance into was given to that person” “Just incredibly lucky”.","date":"2015-07-26","mins":"8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/22/the-shroud-is-a-holograph/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Shroud is a Holograph?"},{"id":"comment-106292","author":"dave_hines","post":"After reading Ron’s comment I pulled up the photos I bought from Barrie and looked at the gap. Ron is right, there is a large noticeable gap between the 2 images. Of course there is also the water stain that is being “falsely perceived” as being the beginning of the image, when it is not. Like has already been mentioned the image was formed by a light source (likely individual laser beams 1/100th the thickness of a human hair) working in a vertical fashion. It is consistent with the entire Shroud image. No side image anywhere. As for the chin band, it seems obvious that this was used. You can see it on both sides of the face. The lines it made on both sides of the front image. Top of the head problem is not a problem. 1. Image is strictly vertical to the horizontal plane 2. A chin band was used (not the Sudarium) It is a combination of both factors that the image appears the way it does. I know I just repeated what Ron just said. And for whatever it is worth, The Lord confirmed it with me personally that a chin band was used and the image is strictly vertical to the horizontal plane. I thought I would ask the person who image is on The Shroud. That is the answer I got.

Another thing we need to do, is to stop limiting ourselves to what we believe is possible, To move outside our circle of comfort, to be more bold & assertive, expansive & faithful in our thinking and take action. To be fearless and without doubt. Those are the character qualities that people gravitate toward and children look up to and want to role model.

It not only did not fit, it was not even close. Some people doing these overlays are changing the aspect ratio of the image which is completely dishonest and deceptive. The overlays on this video are NOT doing that. (I know also that you did NOT do that with this Depp image) The question about the Depp image is where is the forehead? When the eyes are lined up, the forehead must also match up, end of nose and mouth should also be in the same place with very minimal to no drift when it is over laid slowly. Anyone with good video editing software, such as Sony Vegas could overlay these images and will find out that I did a straightforward honest comparison. I have not seen this Prince Williams overlay but I know His face does not line up with The Shroud at all. If it is shown matching, deception is involved. These overlays are done matching only the head length. As soon as that is done, nothing else should be done. If it does not fall into place immediately after length is matched. It is not a match. Because the length is matched does not mean the width will match. Width of image is NOT changed. When the length is matched the width should line up automatically. (It took less than 5 minutes to do the Pantocrator, that is how fast that lined up) Anyone can match eyes into the image but will everything else line up? NO. Only if one changes the aspect ratio which is a very simple thing to do with video editing software, doing this you could make almost image fit. But it also not honest and it is also very easy to debunk and expose as a fraud if one is doing this to deceive someone. God forbid anyone be guilty of doing such a thing. If the skull being matched is for example 9″ in length, then the overlay image being compared must also be 9″ in length. That is only point that is matched, nothing else. Anyways, how do you upload a photo on this site? There is no place to attach a file, how are you getting a photo uploaded on here? Let me know when you have time. That way I can do the overlay and show the in between phases of the images in still shots. We can start with Prince Williams and show everyone how it really lines up honestly. Then the J. Depp image. I will use the same software I used on these images do you can see it. I will match them and do the overlay.

I am uploading a video in regards to this number #3 bloodstain that is so absolutely bizarre that I do not think I will ever hear the end of it. I will be ridiculed and laughed at, but that is OK. I am not going to freak out over it and get upset. This will be no doubt one the most bizarre videos if not the most bizarre video ever uploaded in regards to the authenticity of The Shroud of Turin. I have been accused of trying to cash in on the Man In The Shroud, yet I gave my books away for free and do not make a single penny on any video I ever produced. My income source and my Shroud of Turin research are 2 completely different things. I have lost money, not gained. Well over 5 figures in expenses and nothing coming back and I could care less, I get reimbursed in ways that I cannot even begin to explain. I like doing Shroud research. It is fun and exciting. It also a extremely serious subject. This video is a combination of all those. Very serious and bit of fun at the same time. All things in accordance with the will of God.

I used to bet on professional football. Long shot bets. 6 and 8 team parlays. They way to win was by writing down every possible scenario that could take place and then go through process of elimination and use laws of probability and chance and intuition to determine what to eliminate as a possibility. What was left ,must be the winners. I won a 7 team parlay on the spread doing it. Above average skills doing it. 2 points away from the winning the 8 team, and 3 times won a 6 team parlay. On the spread, that is very hard to do. I finally figured out after years. “I cannot predict the future” and stopped doing it.

Looks like I am actually going to finally have the time to fully read it and absorb it. I am in Central America taking care of some old business involving some “green” owed to me. (Shroud Research Money) Anyways, This is one definition of intuition I found “the way our higher power communicates with us with a “inner knowing” or “inner voice” The book you mentioned, “Blink” I read it. Very interesting. It is very noteworthy to make known the Shroud of Turin case file is the only case in history where the conclusions drawn by 3 different forensic pathologists who were in agreement that a genuine dead body made contact with the Shroud was not accepted. 1st time in the history of forensic science. I have never seen another case where this has occurred. I wonder if that has anything to do with the name Jesus being involved with it? I have also never seen a case file where if an ancient relic was authenticated it could disrupt the balance of power and change the flow of where billions of dollars would wind up. I wonder if that has anything to do with the authenticity debate? Sorry about the sarcasm. We all get the point. Anyways, If the conclusions drawn by 1. Dr. Pierre Barbet 2. Dr. Robert Bucklin 3. Dr. Frederick Zugibe Who all agreed a man in his 30’s, long hair, beard and mustache, appx, 5′ 11″ 175 lbs was 1. Beaten 2. Cap/crown of thorns placed around head 3. Scourged 4. Crucified 5. Legs Not Fractured 6. Side Pierced 7. Wrapped In The Shroud 8. Body Removed from linen before decay (No other person in History we know of other than Jesus underwent those sequence of events) The only note able disagreement in the pathologists report was cause of death, but still dead, yes a dead body made contact with the cloth. All in agreement on that very important point. Dead. Take the name of Jesus out of this and not one person on this Earth would be debating the credibility of the pathologists report, It would be accepted as it would in any unsolved murder case. 3 separate forensic pathologists all in agreement, in a court of law it would be indisputable. Rock Solid. If another forensic pathologist came to different conclusions after examining the linen that would be a different story. But that is not the case with the Shroud. Based on the pathologists report the calculated odds the man in the Shroud is not Jesus is one in a 82 Million, 944 Thousand. 82,944,000 That is not taking into account any of the match points between the Sudarium and the Shroud. That is also not taking into account over 40 names & phrases relating to Jesus and the Shroud of Turin that all equal the same number in English Gematria. If we calculate those factors in one would have to conclude it is not unreasonable to believe if one opened their window they might see a dodo bird flying by and/or be struck in the head with space debris, that would be a reasonable possibility If one thinks that is a probable scenario, a probable scenario that is not unreasonable to believe could take place then that person could also have reasonable doubt The Man in The Shroud is not Jesus. That is how heavy the odds are stacked against the shroud not being the linen that wrapped Jesus. Yes, many have doubt the Shroud is genuine, But is it reasonable doubt? Based purely on math it is not reasonable. Man in the Shroud is Jesus, in the words of Dr. Robert Bucklin “Indisputable”.","date":"2015-07-28","mins":"1:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It"},{"id":"comment-206793","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello Max, I put your definition of the word φαιλόνην as being “A Long Shining Wrap” on the Shroud of Turin Silver Screen. People from many different countries have seen it. This way some of your work gets acknowledged in a visual sense. I will make sure to give you credit on the translation. Over the years I have been attacked by many people. At times extremely hostile, my character assassinated often. Happens all time. It does not matter which side one is on, being pro or against authenticity it is going to happen regardless of your credentials or lack there of. I’ve had to stop and ask myself “Who am I becoming as a person as a result of the Shroud Research I am doing and the films I making?” I found myself at times becoming angry, hostile,even spiteful and rude to others. I do not want to become a angry, hostile, rude and spiteful person. I am talking about myself not anyone else. It is not my place to judge others I had to admit being wrong and have set out on a new format. As a result of Shroud research we should be becoming more loving, more caring, more good humored, more thoughtful, more forgiving, if not it shows something is wrong. “Success is about who we become as a person” In the program of AA, there is thing called a Step 10 “We continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it” That said, I am going to take a Step 10 on this comment section and apologize to anyone I was hostile, rude or spiteful toward. I was wrong in doing that and I am promptly admit it.

Imprint & Ammonia (A Gas) Combo. I like how passionate you are about explaining your image theory. Very detailed descriptions. I found this written about the Shroud, I am sure at some point you have already seen it and has already been discussed on this Blog Site. Perhaps a good time for you to look at it again. Forensic evidence that supports your image theory. This is in regards to the Texas pediatrician/scientist Garza Valdes who was involved in the book “The DNA of God” I do not know if his work is viewed on this Blog Site as being credible or not, but here are some things he found that relate to what you are saying. 1.First, he found that the cloth itself was covered in an organic “”bioplastic coating, a type of clear encasing invisible to the naked eye but composed over time of millions of living microbial organisms.”” Such a coating, which he had first witnessed in his study of ancient Mayan artifacts 2.This finding, coupled with “”infinitesimal splinters of hard wood found near the wound areas,”” and the human male DNA found in the blood stains, led the to ask whether this cloth was indeed the burial shroud of Jesus 3. Also through tests upon bacteria found in the blood stains found on the Shroud’s fibers, Garza Valdes discovered that they contained acetic acid, or vinegar. This evidence indicates that the person buried in the shroud would have been exposed to vinegar, much like Jesus at his crucifixion, his death. Human sweat also contains acetic acid as does myrrh resin. The acetic acid could have gotten on the cloth by more than one method. Myrrh resin is cellulose from wood pulp. When mixed with acetic acid will become cellulose acetate. The main ingredients to make cellulose acetate are 1. Cellulose From Wood Pulp 2. Acetic Acid 3. A Catalyst would also be needed for hydrolysis to take place, such as sulfuric acid. A very small amount. (I am by no means some kind of chemistry expert Collin Berry would be the person to ask about this process) When cellulose acetate is exposed to heat or moisture,it begins to deteriorate to an unusable state, releasing acetic acid with a characteristic vinegary smell, causing the process to be known as “vinegar syndrome.” Do the Shroud fibers have this “vinegar syndrome” going on? Note worthy also is cellulose acetate was used to coat holographic film plates. Just a coincidence. Ray Rodgers believed the image resides in that layer and not really on the fabric. Perhaps it is a combo of both Max you seem to have great insight/intuition on these matters, what do you think?.","date":"2015-07-29","mins":"10:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It"},{"id":"comment-206796","author":"dave_hines","post":"This is a complete list of all image possibilities.

Then they build a big fire in the form of a circle and one of the local leaders of the village holds up the cloth with the image of the fisherman while the people dance around it.

I become less useful to the Lord in whom I serve by doing so. I apologize to him as well. I aspire to put on a better defense for the Man In The Shroud/Jesus. There is racial bias against him, he is not being treated with fairness. There are ancient relics that have been authenticated on far less evidence than the Shroud. If we applied the same harsh criteria to other items as being authentic as is being done with the Shroud, nothing could be viewed as being authentic. We would be carbon dating swords and linens from other famous figures in history. We would have to close every museum in the world and re examine all those items to be sure they are authenticate, including the jaws from monkeys glued into human skulls to fool people into believing in Evolution. All sports memorabilia would be in question, we would have to stop all sales of those items and re examine them. Instead of 3 different handwriting experts to agree on a signature we will need at least a dozen. It could take up to 10 years to make a decision on whether or not Babe Ruth actually signed his name on that baseball, photograph or jersey. We could just start flipping coins to decide if we really get impatient. All antique auctions would be put to a halt; we can’t have some poor soul getting a fake antique. We would have to start exhuming bodies of out every grave in the world and make sure the name on the headstone is really that person. That could be a mannequin buried in the ground and not a real person and some kind of insurance fraud took place. Birth certificates would be in question; we would have to put a freeze on every person’s bank account until they can prove they are who they say they are. Yes, we need to be sure those birth certificates are not computer generated forgeries. How do we know for sure those are not faked? And if the trace pollen evidence left on The Shroud, or absence of vanillin or recent stress tests on the fabric is not acceptable or convincing evidence of The Shroud’s ancient history then we need to start releasing rapists, thieves and murderers from prison, because they were convicted on the basis of similar evidence. BOTTOM LINE; IF THE SAME CRITERIA CURRENTLY IN USE THAT HAS AUTHENTICATED OTHER ANCIENT RELICS WAS APPLIED TO THE SHROUD, The Shroud would be authenticated and accepted worldwide as the pure linen garment that wrapped the body of Jesus without any doubt or question in regards to its authenticity.

A plain flour paste or glue has to be a prime candidate” Myrrh resin does exactly what you described. When it exposed to the open air it becomes sticky like glue and eventually hardens completely. It is not unlike tree sap. It does exactly what you described t it “moulds linen to body anatomy” If used in pure form it will color the linen a sepia, caramel color. There are many different grades of myrrh. When it dries it can become transparent, glossy and light reflective. But not all myrrh resin is like, this. Some grades are opaque when it dries. When the object and cloth has myrrh applied to it, and then wrapped in it, the linen will take on the shape of that object and make a 3 D replica. Very detailed. If for any reason you actually purchase some, make sure you are getting the high grade pure version, not the cheap watered down version with other oils in it. There are only 2 companies on line I could find that have pure linen made from flax, herringbone weave fabric. One is in the UK, the other in Belgium. Myrrh resin is the substance you seek to do what you want to do. It will also be in agreement with what is written scientifically peer reviewed journals as to what the thin layer of carbs is on the Shroud. Sugars. I made a video demonstrating it. It works.

For some time I have been trying to locate the film, “The Silent Witness” and I saw the title on this Blog Site and thanks to Dan I finally found it. It is really well made film. I have not looked at Gematria for months. There are other aspects of the case file that are much more interesting to me, but while watching the film, I got a intuitive nudge to type in Silent Witness on a Gematria,calculator, and I thought, “there is no way it is going to equal 1128” It did, and then the other, Enigma of the Shroud, again 1128, I thought it was a odd “coincidence” Since this post was in regards to the film Silent Witness the majority of my comments were on that subject line. The Gematria display is useful, it is not unlike a appetizer we offer, before we serve the main meal of evidence and other numerical match points. About my post. You wrote,. “It is an exhibition of circumstantial evidence that is not only compelling, but in my viewpoint conclusive as to the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin as burial cloth of Jesus Christ” I could not agree with you more. I have seen many cases with far less evidence in which a jury was able to make a decision and be certain beyond a reasonable doubt a particular person was responsible for a crime. I saw a recent murder case where they did not have the body, but found just a few drops of the person’s blood at the bottom of a Refrigerator and a witness that claimed they saw the defendant put the body in that refrigerator. It was enough to be able to bring the case into a court of law in front of a jury. :Person was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There are many such wrongful death cases, where the party that committed the crime was brought to justice even though they did not have the body. Shroud of Turin case also is a case without the actual body, but is much more compelling evidence of a wrongful death than just 1 witness and few drops of blood. I’ve said this before, but take the name of Jesus out of this and The Shroud is authentic. Not one person would question its authenticity in terms that a actual dead body that was scourged and crucified made contact with the cloth. The Shroud of Turin case file is the only case in forensic history that the conclusions drawn by no less than 3 forensic pathologists in agreement were not accepted and for one reason and one reason only. The name of Jesus is involved. Put in most any other name and it is authentic. No one has to admit guilt if it is another name or have to face the reality that there really is going to be a judgment day and each person will be held accountable for their actions or lack there of.

Hoping all is well for you in great and rich country of Great Britain. I would like to have some of their gold here in Central America. We could use it. I had no idea Dan was taking a break from all this. Hats off to Dan Porter for coming up with some of the most obscure fascinating info on the Shroud and giving both sides of the Shroud debate a voice. I totally understand why he is taking a break. The purpose of the Gematria display is to draw attention to numerous “coincidences” that link the cloth to Jesus. That is all. It is either coincidence or not. Same as the Shroud, it either is authentic or it is not. The inspiration for my post actually came from Barrie Schwortz, he was talking to a Muslim woman with the full size replica and he was pointing out details of the image to her. He pointed out things I had never noticed before. Simon Brown was filming him at the big event in the UK. It was a video on youtube. The other inspiration of what I wrote comes from Investigation Discovery and Forensic files, those are the only TV shows I watch. I like to see genuine crime scene photos, and live videos of crime scenes,, suspects being interrogated, real life situations. Fascinating, I highly recommend both programs. Since I just learned Dan is taking from break this, I am going go close saying a BIG THANKS to Dan Porter for doing an incredible job. I have learned much about the Shroud because of his time and effort. The most valuable thing another person can give us is their time. Dan gave us the very valuable gift of his time. Thank you Dan! I am reminded of the movie called “Never Say Never Again” when Dan says he is not coming back. I wish him great success, Everybody on this Earth has a right to be happy. I think it is important that we acknowledge the good works of others. Dan Porter has done a lot of good. Jesus Christ made a incredible sacrifice, I believe it is critically important that his sacrifice is acknowledged, I see the Shroud as a witness to what happened to him, A Silent Witness, but when questioned the information starts pouring out of him, one detail after another. We all have different destiny’s to follow. I think we are all doing are best under less than desirable circumstances in this day and age.

I rent vacation homes on the Gold Coast of Costa Rica. This time of year is crazy. I have been working 12 hours a day non stop to prepare for guests. Sales exploded this year. That is why my response is so delayed. I am more than interested in thoroughly reading your book. Congratulations again on completing and getting it published. I am so glad I have it. I recently acquired a isolated private house in the mountains of Costa Rica, It has been thoroughly cleaned and prepared so I have a place to retreat and continue Shroud research and make films without distraction. A place I can read your book without one person bothering me. I purchased the life size Shroud replica from Barrie and recently brought it into this location. To actually see the whole 14′ cloth laid out is completely different than seeing it on internet. It is truly a amazing sight to actually see up close and personal, The Shroud of Turin in extreme detail. I brought The Shroud into each property that I represent. I have record breaking sales this year. Double and triple what I normally do. Are the events related or coincidence? I really don’t know. Last night I brought The Shroud to this remote location where people told me “no one will rent a house in this area” “you are wasting your time” “no one will rent that house” My phone rang this afternoon while at the location, I booked the house solid throughout the holiday season, at a price higher than anyone has ever rented it before. The Shroud of Turin was in the house. Either the events are related or they are not. Coincidence or not. The purpose of the Gematria display was to bring attention to the subject of “Coincidences” Not so much as to talk about numerology. I will be in contact with you again when all the smoke has cleared from the rental sales done this year. Quite a financial blaze. Wishing you and everybody else here on the Dan’s Blog site a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Yes, that includes all the skeptics, “God Bless Every One of Them!”.","date":"2015-12-22","mins":"9:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/07/david-rolfes-website/","cat":"other_sites","title":"David Rolfe’s Website"},{"id":"comment-216544","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello there Dcn Andy, the film David Rolfe made, Silent Witness was very well done. The clips with Dr. Robert Bucklin and Dr. Max Frei alone make this worth watching. For whatever it is worth, and on this blog site that would not be much, but after watching the film I went to the online Gematria calculator and just typed in Silent Witness. It equaled 1128. Then I typed in Enigma of the Shroud it was also 1128. Gematria is an Assyro Babylonian system of numerology later adopted by Jews that assigns numerical value to a word or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other or bear some relation to the number itself. I made a film about it that is doing very well on youtube. I leave it up to the viewer to decide whether they think it is a coincidence or not. Those are the only 2 possibilities. It is a coincidence or it is not. Silent Witness=1128 Enigma of the Shroud=1128 Shroud of Turin=1128 Jesus of Nazareth= 1128 The Shroud of the Lord=1128 Genuine Ancient Relic=1128 A Sacred Winding Sheet=1128 Shroud is Genuine=1128 A Picture of Jesus=1128 Cloth Image of Jesus=1128 I could add 40 more to this list, all things relating to the Shroud of Turin. Most people on this blog site would say “they are coincidental matches” Alrighty then. The odds of this happening by coincidence and incredible good luck is conservatively 1 in 900 million. The only reason DNA evidence is compelling, is because there are so many numerical match points it makes it possible to accurately quote odds of probability of chance that the match points are coincidental. Accurate to the millionth of a percent. A numerical match point is a numerical match point, be that in Gematria or any other thing. When you have numerous “coincidences” it makes it possible to calculate the odds of probability chance that the matches are coincidental. This is a way to be certain of something beyond a reasonable doubt. There was a time when they were not sure if The Boston Strangler committed all of the different murders in the city that looked as though they were done by the same person. As in all of such cases, DETAILS OF THE CRIME WERE NOT RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. When the Boston Strangler was interrogated by the FBI, He was able to give them details of the crime scene that only someone who was there could possibly know. HE KNEW DETAILS OF THE CRIME NOT RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. Later when DNA became more sophisticated it was confirmed again that way as well. A line of questioning might go something like this. What color was the dress did she had on? What position was the body in? What was she holding in her hand? What color was the carpeting in the living room? What kind of books or magazines were on the bed? What kind of cigarettes did she smoke? Some of these questions are “trick questions” As in a question such as “What was she holding in her hand?” Which assumes she was holding something when in fact she was not holding anything, if the witness can also confirm that, they know they have a credible witness. Boston Stranger was able to accurately answer these types of questions and knew details of the crime scene that only a person that was there could know. In that time they did not have DNA. It is another way one can be certain of something beyond a reasonable doubt. Again, numerical match points are used. Sometimes the Police are not convinced the person who is confessing is actually the person who committed the crime, so they will question the suspect using a number of different tactics to get to the truth. Since they claim to have done the crime they should know details of the crime scene. Again what convinces a person beyond a reasonable doubt is the amount of numerical match points. One could argue that when The Boston Strangler correctly answered questions about the details of the crime scene he just got incredibly lucky and guessed and just happened to be right, even though he did not commit the murder and was not at the crime scene. The Shroud of Turin is a witness. (A Silent Witness) Knows details of a crime scene that only someone who was at a genuine crime scene could possibly know. For starters, knows that a plain weave white linen was not used as would normally be used in Jewish burial. That was info not released to the public. It states only Joseph purchased fine linen, it does not say what kind of linen. Shroud tells us what kind of linen Joseph purchased, Herringbone weave. Only someone who was present at the crime scene would know such a odd detail. Odds of probability and chance heavily favor that possibility. If any man set out to make a Jesus image on a burial cloth he or she would use plain weave linen unless they actually wanted their work to be rejected and not look authentic. Add numerous other points to the Shroud that went against how all people falsely perceived how the crime against Jesus took place. In fact it is because of the Shroud we know more about crucification. Shroud is a credible witness. Often times forensic evidence tells a story about a murder that does not make sense, and it is the opposite of what forensic detectives expected to find. What happens in genuine reality and how one perceives a event transpired are often completely different and the opposite of what one would expect. The herringbone weave linen is one of those things that seems out of place in the crime scene and would not be what one expected to find. Spirit of God, like the Police DID NOT RELEASE DETAILS OF THE CRIME TO THE PUBLIC, MEANING THE GOSPEL ACCOUNT The Gospel account is in fact a very vague account of events, without much detail, as you would see in a write up in a newspaper about a murder. What is written in the papers or covered in the media about a murder, will not disclose the details or like I said may release false/vague info. What is written in the Gospel account does not include the details of the crime/death and burial of Jesus. SHROUD KNOWS THE DETAILS OF THE CRIME AND THE BURIAL. FORENSIC EVIDENCE MATCHES SCRIPTURE AND THEN GOES BEYOND AND DISCLOSES THE DETAILS OF THE CRIME, DETAILS ONLY SOMEONE WHO WAS AT THE CRIME SCENE COULD POSSIBLY KNOW. EXAMPLES, THE Shroud… 1.Knows what part of beard section was removed/plucked out. 2. Knows what kind of plant was used to make crown of thorns 3.Knows what kind of weapon was used to make scourge wounds 4.Knows the width of a Roman hasta, spear, that made side wound 5.Knows the names of plants growing in the area where the crime took place 6.Knows how long Jesus was in the tomb (between 48 and 72 hours) Knows his stomach became swelled due to gas formation 2 3 days after death 7. Knows that the nail wound went into wrist not into the palms 8. Knows how tall Jesus was 9. Knows Jesus had long hair and was put in a pony tail at burial 10. Knows that Jesus was buried nude 11. Knows how many scourge wounds were applied 12 Knows Jesus was scourged by 2 people, one taller than the other 13.Knows which parts of his face were beaten, right side more than left 14. Knows that one of his eyes (right side) was swollen shut 15.Knows one of his feet made complete impression on the linen, Knows Jesus was buried with his knees raised and body not lying flat 16.Knows that when a nail is driven into wrist thumb moves inward 17. Knows that blood stains will form serum contraction rings 18. Knows that side wound will flow vertically and then horizontally across lower back 19. Knows Jesus was scourged on nearly every square inch of his body 20. Knows one knee is more damaged than the other 21. Knows the name of a rare calcite found in tombs around Damascus Gate and knows the feet, knee and the tip of the nose of Jesus made contact with it. 22. Knows Jesus had type AB blood 23. Knows blood of Jesus had elevated levels of bilirubin 24. Knows that the nose of Jesus was abraded. 25. Knows how much Jesus weighed (appx 175 lbs) 26. Knows the exact angle/ position of the arms when Jesus died on the cross 27.Knows plain weave linen was not used in the burial 28.Knows the width and length of nearly every part of the anatomy of Jesus, There is no other image in the world depicted of Jesus, a life size image, with the vast amount of detail that The Shroud of Turin has. Not even remotely close. What is more probable? The Shroud of Turin was at the crime scene and recorded these details The Shroud of Turin is a man made image and a person made a list such as the one above and said to himself, “I want all these details of my image” “I want Jesus nude even though I don’t know if he was or not, I am just guessing” “I want some rare calcite from Jerusalem on the tip of that nose and I want it abraded” “I want the blood from the side wound to flow vertically across the lower back” “I am not going to illustrate thumbs, I have no idea why” “I am going to illustrate the stomach swelled slightly so if a forensic pathologist studies this it will look as though the body has been dead for 48 to 72 hours” “I want serum contraction rings around the blood stains even though I do not know what serum contraction rings are” “I want the hair in a pony tail and his right eye swelled shut” “I want it to look like Jesus was scourged by 2 people, one taller than the other” “I want pollens from a thistle plant around the head area and I want it on that head cloth in Spain as well” “I want Jesus to be abnormally tall for a person from 1st century” “I don’t want to be acknowledged for my painstaking detailed work, I don’t like money” “I want it to be a total color inversion image even though I don’t understand what that means and have never seen one before”.","date":"2015-12-15","mins":"3:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/07/david-rolfes-website/","cat":"other_sites","title":"David Rolfe’s Website"},{"id":"comment-202185","author":"dave_hines","post":"I watched the entire Thomas De Wesselow presentation. Excellent. I saw artwork I have never seen before and I have seen a lot of paintings of Jesus. Anyone out there that thinks this is easy, hire someone to video tape your one hour presentation on The Shroud and see how it comes off. It is much harder than one would think. You cannot fumble your lines or make mistakes. Must be very focused. He does a very good job. Impressive. The #1 prime suspect for committing the “Image act” has always been Mr. Paint. He has been interviewed and re interviewed by detectives over & over again through out the centuries. Likely waiting for the phone to ring right now, “I have meet with detectives again about this Shroud Image” “They still think I did it’ He claims to be innocent,but there is always the type of person, that wants to bring him in again for questioning and force a confession out of him. “We know you did it” This video, In a comparison analogy, (a bit exaggerated perhaps) but it is not unlike having the prime suspect in a capital murder case (Mr. Paint in this case) captured on a video surveillance camera in another State at the time the act/murder took place, eliminating him as being possible of committing the act. Line up the suspects 1. Mr.Paint (Interviewed 1000’s of times) 2. Mr. Imprint/Contact Image (By genuine body or 3d or 2d material object) 3. Mr. Ammonia (A Gas) 4. Mr. Light One of the 4 is responsible. Or a combo such as Mr. Light and Mr. Ammonia. But, who is the mastermind behind the image act? Shroud Image is 1. Cunning 2. Baffling 3. Subtle 4. Powerful Which of the 4 suspects is the most cunning, baffling, subtle and powerful? Mr.        Deep down inside we all know who is responsible for the image act.

The reason for the delay is money. Holography equipment is expensive, but I have the money now. Anyways, image qualities. 1.Blood Stains 1st. 2. Blood Stains On Pure L Inen Herringbone Weave Fabric 3. Ultra thin coating of starch fractions and pectin on fabric and over the blood stains. 4. Holographic Image residing only in the micro thin layer of starch fractions and pectin and not exceeding primary cell wall of fabric 5. Image not visible when lit from the back. 6. Image not visible from certain angles, but is visible depending on the angle of light it is viewed in. 7.A hologram on linen. I believe the Image of Edessa, “the image not made by human hands” had more dramatic holographic qualities than the present day Shroud. That is why it was called “the image not made by human hands, because no one in that time had ever seen a hologram on linen before, even in this day and age would be a odd sight, Over the centuries the once dramatic holographic qualities Shroud have faded over time, and only a remnant of those holographic observations can be seen in this day and age. Here is testimony that supports what I just stated is true. “ I therefore had the good fortune to see the Shroud in close up for a whole day. When this sheet was enrolled on a long table (with light coming only from one side of the room where there were windows high up), I realized that everything that I had learned up to that point was worth nothing: the image that I thought I knew was not that one. While photography has the advantage of fixing an image in time and of concentrating it so that whichever angle you look at it from, it will remain the same, with the Shroud that is not the case. Moving around that table (lighting under an angle from one side only!), from a certain angle I saw this image so faded as if to practically disappear, while from others it seemed as if the figure WAS ALMOST OUTSIDE THE SHEET: it was, I repeat, an incredible emotion. At that moment I knew that this image was unique” He continues on with these comments… “The image on the Shroud appears more distinct at a distance and fades when viewed at certain angles, particularly as one comes closer to the Shroud. The image is faint, without well defined boundaries so the eye has no point of reference and it appears simply as variation of the background density. In addition, you’re viewing only a small portion of the entire image up close. In a way, it is out of context and it is only as you back away that it is seen as part of the bigger picture that gives it meaning. This is the classical explanation of this observation. HOWEVER, it is also a HOLOGRAPHIC OBSERVATION. If you stand in front of a large hologram, where thanks to the angle of the lighting you are able to see the image, and you back up or come close or go to the side for that matter, the image becomes very vague or disappears completely” I am posting this video I made as evidence that supports my proposition that the Image of Edessa and The Shroud of Turin are the same image. A holographic Image. My corroborating witness is a English Gematria Calculator. Gematria /ɡəˈmeɪ.tri.ə/ is an Assyro Babylonian system of numerology later adopted by Jews that assigns numerical value to a word or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other or bear some relation to the number itself 1. 3 D Hologram of Jesus =1128 2. Behold The Image of Edessa =1128 3. First 3 D Hologram Made= 1128 4. 3 D Hologram of the King= 1128 5. 3 D Scourge Wounds= 1128 6. Son of God Hologram= 1128 7. Shroud of Turin = 1128 Jesus of Nazareth = 1128 It is only 7 minutes long, it is worth every second of your time to view it or I would not have posted it. In closing I think Thomas De Wesselow is 100% correct when he proposes that people saw the Shroud and believed Jesus was resurrected and did not actually see Jesus. Others did see him personally. Again a combination of both, not one or the other. As in image formation is a combo of factors, part contact, part non contact image.

One that sheds light where there is darkness, hope where there is despair, faith where there is doubt and joy where there is sadness. Those are all things Jesus did during his ministry and Russ Breault is doing the same. Good, that is exactly what the Lord wants done. Shroud is a witnessing tool. I am 100% convinced of the authenticity of the Shroud. For 3 Reasons 1. The Forensic Science tells a story of a scourging, mocking, crucification, death & resurrection 2. Scripture tells the same story and the forensic evidence is in agreement with scripture 3. Personally confirmed to be authentic to me by The Spirit of God The 3rd being the most convincing. Back to messages, I think there is a message written plainly on the Shroud, an identification mark/message telling us all exactly who the Man In The Shroud is. Before I say what this is, I have this question for you Daveb of Wellington If you were a forensic detective and came upon the scene of a very brutal murder in which the victim was stabbed 120 times and you came upon this man lying face up and saw what clearly looked like the number 3 written in blood on the right side of that person’s head, would you think it looked out of place? Would you photograph it? Would you measure the blood stain? Would it get your attention & leave you thinking that it was left by the killer, a signature sign? Or would you think by random coincidence the blood coming from a small puncture wound just happened to take on the shape of number 3? The odds of that happening are extremely slim. I challenge anyone in the world to show me a photo of a blood stain that by random coincidence took on the shape of #3. “I am from Missouri you gotta show me something!” Since The Shroud case file is loaded with “coincidences” that all point to the same historical figure as being the Man IN The Shroud I thought I would humor you and add some more bizarre coincidences/messages for you to look at. Messages Behind The Shroud 30 Coincidences Relating to #3 blood stain on Shroud which is “coincidentally” 3cm in length 1. Jesus prayed (3) three times in the Garden of Gethsemane before His arrest. 2. Jesus was placed on the cross at the 3rd hour of the day (9 a.m.) 3. There were 3 hours of darkness that covered the land while Jesus was on the cross from the 6th hour to the 9th hour. (On the cross for 3 hours) 4. NASA confirmed there was a blood moon in Jerusalem on Friday April 3, 33 AD, (This just happened to be the time of the Passover that year) 5. Jonah was in the belly of the whale for 3 days 6. After Elijah was taken into heaven skeptical roman soldiers searched for his body for 3 days but did not find him, only his Shroud/Mantle was left behind. (Preceding Event to the Resurrection) 7. Jesus’ ministry on earth was 3 years and he was 33 years old at death 8. Jesus is 1) Prophet, 2) Priest, and 3) King. 9. There were 3 witnesses to transfiguration of Jesus, John, Peter and James 10. During His ministry Jesus raised 3 people from the dead. 12. There were 3 crosses, 3 people crucified 13. The inscription on the cross of Jesus was in 3 languages. (Showed completeness of His rejection by man) 13. Peter denied Jesus 3 times, 14. Later Peter told Jesus he loved him 3 times 15. Judas betrays Jesus for 30 pieces of silver 16… 3 Samples of Shroud fabric are sent to 3 different labs 17. Shroud of Turin is 3 over 1 herringbone twill fabric 18. 3 women and 3 men were present at burial. 19. Jesus appeared to his disciples 3 times after being resurrected 20. 3 witnesses to Resurrection, Shroud, Sudarium, Empty Tomb It took Saint Joseph and Mary 3 days/3 nights to find Jesus in the Temple; Talking with the elders for 3 days 21. Jesus received 3 gifts at birth, gold, frankincense & myrrh (same at death) 22. Jesus was in the tomb 3 days 23… Jesus said he would rise after 3 days & temple will be re built in 3 days 24. God’s attributes are (3) omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence. 25. God’s essence is that of a Trinity (3) Three in One: Father, Son, and Spirit. 26. Three (3) denotes divine perfection and completeness 27. Jesus died at the 9th hour (3 p.m.). 28. The Number (3) is the number of resurrection 29 The NUMBER 3 IS WRITTEN IN BLOOD ON RIGHT SIDE OF MAN IN SHROUD! 30.. The NUMBER 3 BLOOD STAIN IS 3 CM LONG!!! Are you serious?! Of course these are all just coincidences they have nothing to do with the #3 bloodstain. That is another thing that just happened by random coincidence, like the distance information. That is not distance information, just incredible luck, some fibers are colored and others are not, some lite, some dark. There was no planning involved. #3 bloodstain was not planned either. 9 More Points To Consider Before Dismissing the Number 3 of having significance 1. The Physical Universe consists of 3 things: 1) Time, 2) Space, and 3) Matter 2. Time is divided in 3 different parts: 1) Past, 2) Present, and 3) Future 3. Space is 3 dimensional: 1) Length, 2) Width, and 3) Height 4. Matter coexists in 3 states: 1) Solid, 2) Liquid, and 3) Gas 5. People consist of 3 distinct parts: 1) Body, 2) Soul, and 3) Spirit. 6. Water consists of 3 elements: 2 Hydrogen and 1 Oxygen 7. There is 3 D Information on The Shroud of Turin 8. ELF Waves Around Earth are made up of 3 components. A. The Electrostatic Component B. The E Wave Component C. The Magnetic Component A sophisticated form of wireless communication Spirit of God uses to communicate with 1.plants, 2.animals and 3.people 9. Shroud Fabric is 3 over 1 Herringbone twill fabric, reference to The Shroud in the Bible is 3: 1 Galatians. “You foolish Galatians! Who put you under a spell? Was not Jesus the Messiah clearly portrayed before your very eyes as having been crucified?” (Further Coincidence: There are pollens on the Shroud from Central Turkey where Galatia was) Final “3” Coincidences written in book of Revelation An angel is charged to cry 3 woe’s to those who live on earth to warn them of more trials to come (Revelation 8:13). The murdered bodies of the Two Witnesses will not be allowed to be buried but rather will lie openly in Jerusalem for 3 days before they are resurrected. 3 unclean spirits will be allowed to deceive the whole world to FIGHT the returning Jesus Christ in what is called the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16:13 – 16). The new Jerusalem, created by God for placement on a new earth, will be shaped like a square with 3 gates on each side (Revelation 21:13). # 3 is written in blood on the right side of The Man In The Shroud who is bringing a message of hope and possibility. One that sheds light where there is darkness, hope where there is despair, faith where there is doubt and joy where there is sadness” “Who do you say that I am?”.","date":"2015-03-11","mins":"2:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/nice-review-of-russ-breaults-presentation-in-wisconsin/","cat":"article","title":"Nice Review of Russ Breault’s Presentation in Wisconsin"},{"id":"comment-193165","author":"dave_hines","post":"Opinions vary.","date":"2015-03-11","mins":"10:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/nice-review-of-russ-breaults-presentation-in-wisconsin/","cat":"article","title":"Nice Review of Russ Breault’s Presentation in Wisconsin"},{"id":"comment-196023","author":"dave_hines","post":"I did get a chance to hear Barrie, I listened to the entire broadcast.

I can put this into a question as in one would see in a IQ Test (I know you are a highly intelligent person, I am not doing this in a mocking manner) Which of the following does not fit with the rest of the group? a. Jesus of Nazareth b. Shroud of Turin c. Shroud of the Lord d. Useless exercise e. Son of God 3 D Hologram There are things on The Shroud of Turin unrelated to the distance information but in pointing those out does that mean the distance information on the Shroud is not genuine? In the body of “info” on the Shroud there are water stains. In pointing that out does that mean the distance information is not genuine? There are 2 possibilities All the phrases and words relating to Jesus and The Shroud that equal 1128 are coincidental. All the phrases and words relating to Jesus and The Shroud that equal 1128 are not coincidental. There is a purpose and Higher Power intelligence involved or there is not. There is no in between. Yes or No. Question: What is genuine information? To be genuine information the following criteria must be met. 1. Statistic (Signal, # of Symbols) 2. Syntax (Set of Symbols) 3.Semantics (Meaning) 4.Pragmatic (Action) (When Shroud is placed under VP 8 analyzer the “info takes action”) 5. Apobetic (Purpose) Question: Is the distance info/3 D info on the Shroud genuine info or not? Note that it passes all 5 tests to be genuine, not random. Higher Power intelligence involved. To conclude otherwise is not logical. My Gematria English Calculator has another purpose as well. One of those is to bring attention to this subject. What is genuine and what is not? What is coincidence and what is not? Are all the match points between the Sudarium and Shroud also a series of incredible coincidences? My question: At one point does one stop and conclude “These cannot all be coincidences”! These are all variables one must compute on their own and then at some point, hopefully make a decision. “which means to cut off from any other possibility” To continue in doubt and uncertainty for a prolonged time is unhealthy. . The 2 emotions blend, Doubt and Uncertainty blend and create Fear. The underlying cause of all all illness, both physical and mental. A disease is defined “as something that causes the abnormal function of the mind and body” To be in doubt and uncertainty for a prolonged period will cause one to become ill. Making a decision and taking bold action can eliminate that doubt and uncertainty thus eradicating fear out of your life, the normal function of the mind and body is one of the benefits from making such a bold and courageous move. Is fear a counselor or a jailor? An ally or enemy? If it is the latter there is a problem Sorry to get sidetracked, I am sure you get the point. Thanks for responding Dan.

If it was my goal to create reasonable doubt on the other side. I would take a famous person, such as Tiger Woods for example which equals 810 or another name, place or thing that adds up closer to 1128. And then find 12 words or phrases associated with that person, place or thing that also equals 810 Example: Tiger Woods= 810 Hole in One= A golf pro= Or it could be a famous singer Elvis Presley = 1002 Don’t be Cruel = ? Bottom Line: Should be easy to debunk. If one can find 12 things that make sense and fit in with that person and equal the same number in the minds of a jury it would likely create reasonable doubt. They would be thinking “this works with anything” “This is not a message left behind by the Spirit of God” “It’s coincidental” “that lawyer is trying to trick me into believing the Shroud is genuine” These are other things in Gematria that are also noteworthy to mention. The name of Jesus for example = 888 in 3 languages. Hebrew, Greek and English More 888 Combos (there are more I did not include to save time and space) A Message From God 888 Jesus Messiah 888 The Lion of Judah 888 Jesus The King 888 He is the Messiah 888 He was Scourged 888 Mocked and Crucified 888 He is a crucified Man 888 Laid in a Garden tomb 888 A clean linen cloth 888 Burial Shroud 888 Eternal Kingdom 888 Saved In Jesus 888 Here are some 666 Combos (there are more I did not include to save time and space) 1. Mark of Beast=666 2. Witchcraft=666 3. Insanity=666 4. Slaughter=666 5. Corrupt=666 6. Necromancy=666 7. Demonic Evil=666 8.Image of Satan=666 9.Forehead Sign=666 10.Satan’s Seal=666 11. Demon Inside=666 12. Satan’s Hell=666 13. The Eden Snake=666 Gematria has been around for thousands of years. The English language has only been around for 550 years. Therefore the following results in Gematria could not have been fixed or set up by human intelligence. It is either a coincidence that’s a statistical monstrosity or a message from a higher source. Unlike other modern languages, the English language is the world’s language, to which all others must comply in order to conduct business in the modern world. If a Higher Power wanted to reach the largest amount of people with a message, the English language would be the one he would use to leave messages behind. It is of my belief that is exactly what was done. Many centuries ago. On a closing note I want to make it clear I am not posting things like this with the goal of “proving someone wrong” or out of spitefulness. I do not want anyone feeling uncomfortable or bad in any way. Quite the opposite. I want people feeling good. Having success in their lives. Feeling free and happy. That includes every body. Skeptic or not. Everyone deserves a chance to have a happy, successful and purposeful life. It is of my belief that can be achieved by one turning their life and will over the care of the Man in The Shroud/Jesus. To give him a chance before rejecting him as a folklore story. No one wants to come to the end of their life with a “What If?” “What might have been had I given God a chance in my life” That said. May The Holy Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding Rest upon you, A spirit of power and love eternal. Amen.","date":"2015-08-03","mins":"5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/29/barrie-schwortz-on-catholic-radion-indy/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"Barrie Schwortz on Catholic Radio Indy"},{"id":"comment-207354","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello Hugh: I do believe in coincidence and random good luck. That is based on years of research. Yes, one could falsely perceive a Higher Power/God is involved in something when in fact it is not. A single random event or even a few repeating themselves does not add up being to a miracle/message or as being genuine information. In the same way a single letter or 2 does not make a word. But when a event repeats itself over and over again is where it gets the attention of a forensic detective, as in 7 or more coincidences that point to the same suspect. In such cases what were initially called “coincidences” turned out not be coincidence. Recall that I wrote “I challenge anybody in the world to type in the name of a famous person, place or thing on a English Gematria Calculator and then find 33 other phrases and or words that relate to that person, place or thing and they will all have the same number?!” Where are the other 32 phrases or words that relate to Demon Mind Control that equal 1128? Where are the other 32 phrases or words that relate to Satanic Bloodline that equal 1128? Where are the other 32 phrases or words that relate to Alien Infiltration that equal 1128? Those are random events, single letters that do make a complete word or message. . Pieces of a puzzle that do not make a complete picture. To make it easier try and find only 12 other words or phrases under, Demon Mind Control or Alien Infiltration that equal 1128. And they must have an obvious direct connection. Such as Shroud of Turin= 1128 Jesus of Nazareth = 1128 A Picture of Jesus= 1128 The Shroud of the Lord=1128 A Sacred Winding Sheet=1128 Son of God 3 D Hologram=1128 Named Jesus Christ=1128 There is no grey area there. They fit together, like pieces of puzzle that are obviously connected and go together with ease. Satanic Bloodline and Demon Mind Control are related. Good. Where are the other 31 phrases or words that relate to it? That is only 2 pieces of a puzzle, 2 letters that do not make a complete word or message. Random events without meaning. To be genuine information the following criteria must be met. 1. Statistic (Signal, # of Symbols) 2. Syntax (Set of Symbols) 3.Semantics (Meaning) 4.Pragmatic (Action) (When Shroud is placed under VP 8 analyzer the “info takes action”) 5. Apobetic (Purpose) What you listed does not meet this criteria. What I listed is much closer to meeting the criteria for genuine information, The acid test to know if there is a outside intelligence at work or not is this, Does the “info” pass all 5 tests? If so we can then a make a clear distinction between what is random or not random. Coincidence or not. There are still missing pieces of the puzzle that I have not listed. It is not yet a complete picture. On a side note, the distance/3 D info on Shroud meets/passes all 5 of the requirements to be genuine information. Not a random letters and meaningless symbols that do make a complete message. Look at the list. Shroud passes all 5. Extremely noteworthy. Your skills at math are way above average. You should be able to debunk what I wrote here as not being genuine information with fair ease if is coincidental and random. But it will take more than just presenting a few random events to do so. And while doing so, make sure to have some fun doing it! Enjoy the journey.

You have a very imaginative unique writing style, with a touch of humor as well. The only thing I am actually selling and promoting is my vacation rental property. I have some guests coming this week and a ill person I have to attend to so I have to make this response a bit short. We do not promote any of our videos, on rare occasion they are shared as the one shared on this this site. But that does not increase views being here. People come by attraction not promotion. If we wanted bigger numbers, we could go that route, but we prefer not too. We are against door to door knocking and telemarketing type things. Very much against that. The Gematria display is a take it or leave it type presentation. I don’t believe there is anything magical about Gematria. Just letters and numbers. We try not to get to hung up on any single display. You mentioned a “mind control fraternity” I am not exactly sure who that would be in reference too, but on our channel we are not interested in controlling anyone or recruiting anyone. We sell nothing. We do not ask a person to part with any of their hard earned money. To do so would be against the will of God. At least for me, I can’t speak for anyone else. We do not have a Church or Ministry or anything like that. We ask only that people acknowledge the good works of the Lord Jesus. The Shroud being a witnessing tool only. Let the Spirit of God take over after that. Who is also not controlling or domineering but flexible and open minded. That is based on my personal experience. There are a lot of sick people in the world Mr. Collins doing very unholy and sick things. Claiming to represent the Lord yet they do not represent him. Launching attacks against people like you mentioned, I believe you called it a serial browbeater. Just so you know not everyone is like that. In the same way one who is skeptic/sceptic cannot be stereotyped as being            It is flat out not true. Or one who is pro authenticity for the Shroud is not a. We are all unique individuals with different life paths to follow. Different destinies. A time and a purpose for everything under Heaven. On a closing positive note you are least doing experiments and making a visual presentation with how you believe The Shroud image was formed. Not many are doing that. We live in a visual age. People want to see things. Let them see everything. Let them see both sides. Like I said in the beginning, there is a sick person I have to attend too that requires my attention. I have to go. Perhaps we will cross paths again in the future sometime. Peace.

A few months ago I put fresh red blood on 7 different samples of pure linen fabric herringbone weave (made from flax) My own blood in this case. It is still red. I believe another contributing factor for why the blood is still red has to do with what the surface that blood is making contact with. Pure linen in this case. I am NOT in disagreement the elevated levels of bilirubin are the major reason why the blood has remained red, only mentioning the fact that the blood being transferred to pure linen fabric may be another contributing factor.

France? I’ve reached a point in my research where I feel absolutely compelled to be be able to present what I am saying about The Shroud in a visual sense, a genuine demonstrated reality. In the same way if I was a Big Foot Researcher I would want to present a high quality video of Big Foot, up close and personal right live on camera. “Here it is” One that would leave absolutely no doubt “This thing really does exist” Get a blood sample as well and bring it to a lab. If I was a UFO researcher I would want a actual spacecraft on the ground with aliens getting out of the craft, on video. Close up shots and with a high quality camera. Live on video, Full HD, with sound. If I was trying to prove a demon exists I want one on camera or film an exorcism with a body levitating and objects flying around the room. One the huge challenges in Shroud research is that at some point in the research it requires having an actual dead body to wrap in pure linen herringbone weave fabric and attempt to recreate the scenario that went down in 1st Century and with the appropriate spices. As crazy as that may sound that is what is needed. A genuine dead body and start experiments. A good relationship with the City Coroner would be helpful. That is one of the reasons I am here in Central America. I brought all my gear with me. A lot of paranormal equipment. Night vision cameras, EVP Voice Recorders, Electro Magnetic Field Sensor, Ect. There is a Sanitarium here that also used to be max security prison I want to go see soon. Supposedly one of the most haunted places in the world Some of the testimony and photos I saw warrants going to the location and filming. All night long if need be. Anyways, I am wishing you success in your Shroud research. Many of the things you are saying make sense to me. See if you can purchase all the spices you need. Pure linen fabric of herringbone weave is available on line. Many of the things you need are available on E Bay. The spices and the fabric.

Very difficult. This process involves having a more powerful laser than what I have. Barrie did mention also the Shroud has never been reproduced, Many centuries ago The Image of Edessa was “the image not made by human hands” “The Shroud of Turin” is also…….. “the image that cannot be made with human hands” A very obvious connection, A coincidence? I think not. At the end of the day after all is said and done The Shroud remains “the image that cannot be made with human hands” And long after we are both gone and have left this world, The Shroud will still be the only image in the world we cannot replicate.or fully explain. (unless the Spirit of God grants one the wisdom, understanding and insight into how it was) Who knows? that person could be you, maybe even tonight. All things are possible. If the Image of Edessa was just some painting on linen there would be historical record of it.

I apologize in any way if my post comes across negatively argumentative or overly aggressive. I don’t want anyone feeling bad, or disrespected in any way. I believe The Shroud was replicated in many ways by many people throughout the centuries. Hundreds and thousands of different types of imitations, In the same way in this day and age any thing considered great is immediately.imitated/replicated. Be that a song, piece of art, a movie, clothing, a new car, toy or game, add infinitum to the list,. Great things are imitated. In most cases if not all, the original thing has to exist 1st before there can be a imitation. Where is the original role model? It looks very obvious to me. However, Until new evidence is forthcoming and I am able to present in a visual sense new evidence that supports the authenticity of the Shroud I am not going to be posting in regards to the Shroud on this Blog, with perhaps some rare exception, the exception being if The Spirit of God compels me to, and it is in accordance with his will. I am not carrying out my own personal agenda. I seek God’s will with diligence and 100% commitment. Over 7 years now. My work to date is the result of that commitment. I’ve made some mistakes and made some overstatements in some of my presentations. But we learn by doings things and taking action. I know what needs to be done.

This would be not unlike exhibiting a 2014 auto at a antique classic car auction and saying “look at my antique car” “It’s 100 years old” “it was driven by Charles Chaplin in 1914” “who wants to buy it?” There is actually little doubt that it is a medieval forgery, No doubt in my mind what so ever (for whatever that is worth which is not much) That is actually also a quote from Dr. Frederick Zugibe chief medical examiner of Rockland County New York in regards to whether or not he believed a genuine dead body made contact with the Shroud, which he did believe the linen made contact with a genuine human man and said, quote, “I have no doubt in my mind what so ever” That does carry weight. His yes was yes and his no was no. Convinced. Not lingering in doubt and uncertainty. He made a decision, decision comes from a word that means “to cut off from any other possibility” The Latin meaning of the word decision literally means, “to cut off.” Making a decision is about “cutting off” choices – cutting you off from some other course of action. Now that may sound a little severe and limiting, but it’s not. It’s liberating (as long as it is a decision not made in haste) The Shroud being a medieval forgery would also mean The Savoy family was involved with something they knew was not genuine, as in a man made fabricated image and faced with the task of attempting to pass off a 100 year old fabric as being 1,400 years old?! “I hope we don’t have any textile experts coming to today’s Shroud exhibition, if so we could be in big trouble if the word gets out we are really a group of deceiving liars” “Is there any way you can make that cloth look older?” “Don’t let anyone get to close to it, I would like to stay in my position as the King of Italy” I agree people are sometimes/often gullible, but not that stupid, “Excuse me Sir, you can’t be serious about this cloth, it means it looks like it was made last week” It would have destroyed their credibility as leaders of Italy if they were displaying what looked like a relatively new fabric they were informing people was 1,400 years old. They would have been the laughing stock of Italy and not remained in power very long if they were involved in this kind of deception involving Jesus and the cloth he was buried in. I cannot in my wildest imagination picture the Savoy Family purchasing The Shroud without conducting a thorough investigation into it’s history and closely examining the linen before doing so. Interesting to note everything I have seen in their collection of relics are all genuine things, no reproductions of any kind, fakes or forgeries. Shroud of Turin was in their collection. If we applied the same “impossible to reach standards” to all things in which authenticity was at question, as is being done with the Shroud nothing would ever be authenticated. We would all forever be in doubt and uncertainty. Lingering in the middle. I cannot imagine anything more utterly painful (with some exceptions) than not being able to make a decision and stuck in that grey twilight of uncertainty for all my life. Jesus said, “Let your Yes be Yes and let your No be No, anything other than this shows something is wrong and comes from the Evil One” My Yes is Yes and my No is No. Yes, The Shroud is authentic, and No, it is not a medieval forgery. Lingering in doubt and uncertainty for a extended period of time in not healthy. It creates fear within your body The way to eliminate the fear is to make a decision. “To cut off from any other possibility” Dr. Frederick Zugibe made that decision, a forensic pathologist. In a court of law authenticity type setting, that would be the testimony that would carry the heaviest weight, second to none and greatly aid one in making “A decision” Take a good look at all the possibilities before cutting off from them.
