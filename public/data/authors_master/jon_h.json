{"misc":[{"author":"jon_h","post":"There has been a considerable amount of good, scholarly, research done on the Shroud beginning in the 70s.  Issues of radiodating aside, what is frequently not heard much anymore is that the image in negative is a match for a human body in three dimensions, the blood typed as AB, there are pollen grains in the cloth consistent with a middle eastern origin, the face on the cloth has sufficient concordance with almost every major “portrait” of Jesus from antiquity to be admitted in court as evidence of being the same person, and a bloodstain pattern that oddly matches those on another item claimed to be the cloth wrapped around the head of Jesus (the shroud image and cloth must be reproduced on a 3 dimensional “head” for this to work.Currently, there is doubt about the radiodating from the 80s because of repair work done to the shroud in the middle ages, a new claim of dating that encompasses the 1st century, and some suggestion that neutrons could produce such an image.I don’t remember the exact issue or the author, but in a comment to Nature in the late 80s, a scientist wrote in and suggested that we don’t understand the physics that might be involved in resurrection.  If the item is the genuine article it will stand up to any scrutiny that takes a valid, objective, approach to questioning its validity.","date":"February 13, 2014 at 11:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/13/what-things-would-not-be-known-until-800-years-into-the-future/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What things would not be known until 800 years into the future?"}]}
