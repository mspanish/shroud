There have probably been many many experiences of the spirits of people going to heaven and coming back to tell of it but being discouraged by the unbelief of other people…and the fear of ridicule.  Maybe that’s why God can use a little child who simply tells what he saw and heard and doesn’t question it, just confidently relates all to his parents.\n  Jesus is the way, the truth and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Him.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2011 at 12:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"sonja","post":"I have to say that Heaven is for Real is a tremendous testimony. Not to say that I have doubts before reading this book but that the true is that when you hear a testimony like this, your faith increases and you get more strength and patience to meet our savior one day soon. I strongly believe that this generation won’t pass without witness the coming of our Jesus,   king of kings, lord of lords, and the light of my life.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2011 at 10:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
