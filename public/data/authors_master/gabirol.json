I fully agree with you.I am finishing his new book and, in my opinion, it’s a very interesting, honest and well balanced book (although his English is a bit difficult to me).Also in Spain most media never deal with shroud matters seriously (and many times  making jokes). At the bottom, they don’t want to recognize the authenticity of the shroud because, if they do it, they would also have to recognize the resurrection of Jesus.Thanks again.\n\n","date":"April 22, 2010 at 1:42 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2010/04/ian-wilsons-turin-shroud-theories-are.html","title":"\n`Ian Wilson's Turin Shroud theories are the worst kind of junk history'\n"}],"archaeology":[{"author":"gabirol","post":"\n\nThank you for your quick response to that unscientific claim.I completely agree with you. The Gibson claim, as you say, is statistically fallacious at all.   I think that it is totally absurd.Curiously (and suspiciously), all these “news” are being released just before the forthcoming shroud exhibition at Turin.  Thank you once more.\n\n","date":"December 18, 2009 at 2:31 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2009/12/burial-shroud-proves-turin-shroud-not.html","title":"\nBurial shroud proves Turin Shroud not from 1st century C.E.
