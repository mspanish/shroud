First of all, you don’t have “6” features, but 3 at most, because whatever appears on the tomb lid is irrelevant to the question of the shroud. Even supposing you establish the uniqueness of the tomb lid there is still the brute fact that it’s not the shroud.But the rest of your features don’t fare much better. Cut-off legs don’t count (explained in a comment above), so that’s 2. Nakedness and 4 fingers are not independent, so that’s 1…“This is is the part of the job you sceptics have done for me”Doesn’t work that way, sorry. The research is still up to you. More so if we skeptics are as wrong and inept as you think.“But not the other way, the crossed hands do not imply nudity. And nudity is the key feature here, not crossed hands (maybe I didn’t explained that in the article clear enough).”You didn’t get this one, I’m afraid. It’s not about the crossed hands. It’s about whether nudity is independent from 4 fingers.Nudity is correlated with crossed hands, that’s a fact (because nudity needs to be covered – and if not with a cloth, then with crossed hands, unless we imagine some Austin Powers-like visual devices which surely weren’t in use back then ;) ). And it seems that crossed hands are correlated with 4 fingers. So it seems that nudity is correlated with 4 fingers and thus cannot be treated as an independent variable. Again, not a 100% proven fact, but the images I found are enough for a decent prior probability. It’s up to you to refute this.“Because you selected those images.”I didn’t really have to try hard to select the images, most are from the first Google Image search pages. But in any case that’s hardly an answer.Why is the thumb absent or barely visible on the images I selected?“None of your illustrations show full nudity like in the Codex Pray.”Which is relevant how? Where the images are not nude, they still have crossed hands which seem to be correlated with 4 fingers. Where the images *are* nude, they *almost necessarily* have the crossed hands, and so there still seems to be the correlation between nakedness and 4 fingers. That is, where Jesus is naked, we expect with extremely high probability that his hands will be crossed over the genital area, and with a decent probability that they will lack thumbs.“It doesn’t really matter whether 1 in 20, 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000. The point is that the chance for randon accumulation of so many scarce traits, similar to those spotted on the Shroud, is really negligible.”Oh, but it does matter. E.g. 10^-3.9 may be small, but it is still much better than 10^-6. (Not that I would agree with this number for the reasons outlined above.)So you still owe us the reasonable probabilities and not simply something taken out of thin air.“I took into account such possibility -but the whole reasoning is totally irrelevant on that, as it doesn’t assume whether the rectangle on the lower illustration is lid or the Shroud,”Well, that’s the fatal flaw, because if what we see is a lid (and it is a lid) then none of the probabilities matter. “or anything (just the potential possibility of it being the shroud is enough).”There is no such realistic possibility. The comparative analysis with the iconography of the same era shows that the rectangle could only be a lid, while the shroud is never portrayed as a huge hard rectangle and certainly not under the angel’s feet (what is often portrayed under the angel’s feet is, again, the tomb lid). In fact, the shroud is present on both illustrations, on the top one it’s below Jesus, on the bottom one it lies on the tomb lid. This fully corresponds to the traditional iconography of the era, where the shroud takes relatively little place after the resurrection since it’s all bunched up. So there is simply no question of the rectangle being anything but the lid. If you will be consistent and apply your probability analysis to this particular issue (how many images show the shroud as a rectangle, etc., etc.), you might see this. I’m afraid that probability will be astronomically lower even that the one you have calculated above.“Besides the bench I found and on which the angel is sitting clearly disproves it being a lid:”That’s a non sequitur. Whatever the angel is sitting on has no bearing whatsoever on the rectangle being a shroud or a lid. Although I also disagree that he necessarily sits on a bench, just because there is something drawn there doesn’t mean he sits on that something. Although he might. Doesn’t make a difference.","date":"March 2, 2015 at 8:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"skeptic","post":"“The fact is that the legs are indeed cropped there. This is undisputed coincidence with the Shroud.”The ends of feet were physically cropped with the rest of the page. *We know that the feet were there earlier*. Hence it can in no way be any meaningful coincidence.“But this could have been as well deliberate decision of the illustrator who put the legs on the very margin to be cut while trimming.”LOL?“Because you have selected those images with invisible or hardly visible thumbs.”Now you are going in circles without even trying to answer the question.“Besides lack of thumbs is something different, much stronger than “hardly visible thumbs” or thumbs obscured by geometric perspective.ЭIt is, in fact, the same principle.“This whole reasoning is obviously wrong. Your own illustration shows why:Here we have crossed hands, yet no nudity, as the loincloth is clearly visible. And there are 5 fingers visible on each hand.”And you have, once again, failed to grasp the very simple, really, trivial argument that I make.Once again: crossed hands don’t imply nudity, but nudity does (with huge probability) imply crossed hands. So you giving me an image of crossed hands without nudity does not in any way address my argument.Hopefully now that I have explained it in easy, short words for the second time, you will get it at last and stop making strawman arguments like “But crossed hands does not imply nudity nor 4 fingers..” – because of course I never implied otherwise and such a claim is irrelevant to the argument that I am making.“But 10^-3.9 (close to 1 in 1000) is a small number, even if two orders of magnitude larger than 10^-6. it is close to null -and that’s the main point.”That’s not the main point, because it may be 1/5 for all I know. In any case, as has been demonstrated, you don’t have 6 independent features in need of explanation. Maximum one, and that one is rendered irrelevant by the fact that the miniature depicts a tomb lid, not the shroud.","date":"March 3, 2015 at 1:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"skeptic","post":"“They look similar, yes.

One need not do more than compare this with other miniatures.In fact, one need not do more than compare the top and the bottom images, because the shroud at the top looks nothing like the rectangle at the bottom.Oh and this: “The small cloth resting upon it, might wrap a head” – like some others, you have fallen into a trap of not studying the provided links. You can see clearly that on some of them both the covering and the shroud appear, and both are very small and “bunched up”. Moreover, it can easily be that the cloth on that image is supposed to extend up to the red zig-zag lines, i.e. the area with the crosses may belong to the shroud. Be that as it may, this has no bearing on the function of the rectangle.“It would be the only tomb-lid ever drawn with four poker holes drilled in it in the shape of an L.”That they’re holes is an interpretation in need of evidence. They’re circles, decorative elements beloved by the master of the Pray codex. These circles are everywhere. In fact, there are also 5 circles on the sarcophagus – which believers interpret as the second half of the shroud, thereby receiving an obvious contradiction, because the real Shroud has 4 holes on both sides.Conclusion: there is no evidence tying the Pray codex to the shroud of Turin. Personal feelings aside, it certainly cannot be used to disprove the carbon dating.","date":"March 4, 2015 at 12:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"skeptic","post":"Addition: 5) The author willfully ignored the obviously relevant divergent features in his “calculations”, which on its own renders them invalid.","date":"March 3, 2015 at 5:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"skeptic","post":"If those other tomb lids which literally hang in the air can be described as being “propped” by columns or such (even though they go “through” the columns, and some literally hang in the air, as if the angel was the “magnet” for them), then the Pray tomb lid can likewise be described as being propped by the sarcophagus.You lose again, troll :)","date":"March 3, 2015 at 4:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"skeptic","post":"“It’s OK, homes, you’ve been schooled more than once here today, esp. well so by daveb below.”I’m afraid I’m the only one doing the schooling here.

Formal grounds:a) The author did not provide any justification for his probability estimates.b) The author did not provide any justification for treating his probabilities as independent, which can only be established through actual statistical research of the contemporary iconography.For example, there is a probable connection between nudity and 4 fingers (a nude figure will almost certainly be exhibited with crossed hands, and there is an abundance of images from different eras with crossed hands which lack thumbs; indeed, the person anointing Jesus’ body in the top image on f.28 of the Pray codex also lacks a thumb while his hand is in the position similar to that of Jesus; thus it is not proven that nudity and 4 fingers can be treated independently for the purpose of estimating probabilities).2. Substantial grounds:a) The author claims the cropping of Jesus’ feet as a significant coincidence with the Shroud of Turin, yet there are two facts that undermine this conclusion:a1) We know that as a rule medieval manuscripts had very wide margins, because the scribes knew that their books would be rebound and trimmed several times in the next  few centuries. It is thus extremely improbable that the current very narrow margins are the original margins, give or take a few mm.a2) We know that the Pray codex *was* trimmed, because it has some marginal text neatly cropped, which means that the manuscript as a whole did undergo this standard treatment.It is thus the default fact-based assumption that the original margins were a few cm wider than what we have now. This assumption must be proven false before one ascribes any significance to the cropped feet and uses them in any probability estimates.The author has failed to do this.b) The image has to be interpreted first and foremost in the light of the contemporary iconography. A comparison with other medieval manuscripts demonstrates that the bottom picture on f. 28 of the Pray codex shows three Marys standing behind the cross-adorned sarcophagus, with the angel having his feet on the lid of this same sarcophagus. The contemporary iconography allows for no other interpretation, various fishy analogies notwithstanding.c) The author’s claim that the pyramid-like pattern on the tomb lid refers to the herringbone weave pattern is false, because it looks nothing like the actual herringbone weave pattern, which looks like a series of parallel straight fish bones. Hence this alleged coincidence is also imaginary.d) The author’s claim that the tomb lid is actually the Shroud of Turin is also refuted by comparing the top and the bottom pictures on f.28: the top picture shows Jesus’ shroud, which, with its numerous folds and without any pattern, looks nothing like the rigid patterned rectangle on the bottom image.e) The author only takes into account what he thinks are convergent features, while ignoring the divergent features in his probability estimates. These divergent features include:e1) Lack of the image on the alleged shroud.e2) Lack of the actual herringbone pattern on the alleged shroud.e3) Lack of the corresponding pattern on the second half of the shroud (which is actually a depiction of the sarcophagus).e4) The different number of circles on the two alleged halves of the shroud (4 and 5).e5) Lack of wounds on Jesus’ body.e6) Jesus’ hands are crossed at the wrists (or even above them), not at all like the hands on the shroud.Conclusion: the author failed to show that his probability estimate is valid. Moreover, it has been shown that the rectangles on the bottom image of folio 28 in the Pray codex refer to the sarcophagus and its lid, not to the two halves of the shroud.

He does not provide actual evidence for independence which can only be based on actual research.The point stands.“The attempts to show the connection between two features based on the biased, selective sample have no grounds.”The author has not dealt with the evidence, nor has he provided any evidence for independence between nudity and 4 fingers.The point stands.2. “We cannot determine the original size of the relevant sheets in the Pray Codex.”The author admits this, thus admitting that he cannot show the significance of the cropped feet.Also the author ignores the fact that due to reasons a1 and a2 it is simply hugely more probable that we are missing a few cm, and it is thus up to him to prove otherwise. Without such a justification his cropped legs cannot be any kind of a significant coincidence.The points stand.b) “As the Codex Pray is unique with its exceptional Shroud-linked features, any comparisons with contemporary iconography are baseless. The exceptions defy the rules -by definition. This is the basic logic.”Every image is unique in some respects. This does not mean that it can be interpreted outside of the light of contemporary iconography.“See above. Contemporary iconography cannot be applied for a single very specific example which may go against it.”The contemporary iconography must always be applied. The author has given no reason whatsoever for ignoring it, other than special pleading.The point stands.c) “The interpretation of zigzag pattern as an attempt (even if inaccurate) to portray herringbone pattern is fully justifiable.”There is no reason to suggest such an interpretation, other than mounting an apologetic for the Shroud of Turin – which leads to a logical vicious “circle”. In any case this cannot be proposed as one of the “coincidences” to be explained since it’s in itself at most a hypothesis which requires stretching of facts.The point stands.d) “The difference between representation of the Shroud on top and bottom pictures of f:28r is irrelevant, if one takes into account other contradictory represenations in the Codex.For example f:27 shows Jesus crucified in traditional Byzantine style implying 4 nails used, while there are only three nails on the arm of the cross hold by an angel on f:28v:”Non sequitur. The author tells us that the same object is depicted by the same author on the same page in absolutely different forms, so that it is actually unrecognizable from image to image, and he “explains” it by bringing up irrelevant and not immediately obvious minute differences in nail depictions(!). This is absurd on its face.The point stands.e) “There are no features that would exclude the hupothesis that the Shroud of Turin is referenced in the Codex Pray.”The author misses the point. Whether or not such features absolutely exclude the hypothesis is irrelevant. They do go *against* the hypothesis, lowering its probability. Thus they must be a part of the calculation, otherwise the calculation is one-sided makes no sense. Like a trial where only evidence for one side has been presented.The point stands.e1) “Lack of the image on the alleged shroud.Irrelevant. If illustrator decided not to portray the image on the Shroud for some reason, he had the right to do so. Demands of the skeptcis 800 years so about what the illustrator should and what should not have portrayed are lacking any basis.”The author’s suggestion that this most relevant point is “irrelevant” is absurd on its face. While there may be far-fetched ad hoc hypotheses that explain this state of facts, this fact does add the “negative” (i.e. against the hypothesis) probability to the wholesale count. It must be a part of the probability calculation.The point stands.e2) Same as above.e3) “The second rectangle on the lower image is irrelevant -as it is hard to interpret what it represents. I have never claimed that it has to be the other half of the Shroud.”Fair enough, although other sindonologists have generally interpreted it as the second half of the shroud.Which only leads to further problems for the author, to wit:2.1: Where is  the second half of the shroud on the image?2.2: What do the P-circles on the second rectangle represent? If they don’t represent holes, why should one assume that the L-circles represent holes? How does the presence of non-hole P-circles influence the probability that the L-circles are holes rather than ornaments?e4) The point withdrawn for this particular author. However, see e3.e5) Same as e1.e6) Point withdrawn.Conclusion: most of the points stand. 3 points are withdrawn, 2 points are added. The main conclusion stays:“the author failed to show that his probability estimate is valid. Moreover, it has been shown that the rectangles on the bottom image of folio 28 in the Pray codex refer to the sarcophagus and its lid, not to the two halves of the shroud. The discussion about the Pray codex and its relation to the Shroud is now over.”PS: See, you can do almost without ad hominems when you try. Also, I’m not a historian.","date":"March 6, 2015 at 6:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"skeptic","post":"[deleted]","date":"March 6, 2015 at 8:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"skeptic","post":"“Yeah, double-faced Mr ‘Skeptic’ does not care about double standards. He is eager to insult others, but he cries that other attack him ad hominem.”We are talking about the situation after Dan Porter told everyone to cut it out. I did immediately. The insults from OK and Nabber continued.” Perhaps because the discussion turned form the Codex Pray (where all arguments have been actually repeated many times in this long discussion), to the not-so-mysterious person of Mr Skeptic”Thank you for confirming that you have turned to ad hominem arguments. Just like I said.I’m afraid you’re deluded about my person, just as you’re deluded about the Pray codex. I have asked around and searched around and I assume that you think that I am Andrea Nicolotti. Dr. Nicolotti’s knowledge of all matters pertaining to the Shroud is incomparably higher than mine. But I hope it won’t sound as an insult to say that my English is a little bit more free-flowing than his.
