{"dating":[{"author":"david_wilson","post":"Prof. Jull has told Prof. Fantie that they received two pieces from Turin, one larger and one smaller. call them L and S. That’s not news. Everybody knows that. But the revelation that Arizona cut L into three pieces and only used two of the pieces L1 and L2 for C14 and saved the third piece L3 is a shocking revelation. So where is L3 and where is S and which is the piece that Prof. Jull kept in his office. Does Prof Fantie know???? Talk about chain of evidence and accountability. Sounds like we need thje wikileaks bunch to find out what is going on in Tucson.  Good find Prof. Oxley.\n\n","date":"January 21, 2011 at 11:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/21/mark-oxleys-paper-is-a-must-read/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Oxley’s Paper is a Must Read"}]}
