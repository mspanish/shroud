During my university years I began to think too deeply for scientific answers which made me question my original faith. Only when I submitted to my childlike state could I find the answers. Which in itself is another mystery! They’re everywhere! Lol.But too, this is just what “I” see in the scripture. I believe the Bible is a personal gift to each of us as individuals with different passions (and translations) to help us through our time on earth.
