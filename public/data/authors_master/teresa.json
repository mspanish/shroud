{"art":[{"author":"teresa","post":"I was at the hospital with my mom and she told me there is a man that stopped by who is over your fathers care. he want to speak to all of us as a family about the options your father has…(my dad was dying of septis he was on a vent) and he will come back and tell us the options on reviing your dad or letting him go on his own. I guess my father was awake and was coherent enough to meet this man when he was drugged because of the pain he was in. \nwhen this man arrived there was something about him he stood out to me because he wasn’t dressed like any other staff didn’t have a hospital badge or coat on. when we talked to him my questions got to him like they bothered him so much-like it broke his heart…..I asked him will my father die and at that point when he said most likely its just a matter of time..it seemed his heart broke for me. the other doctors and nurses were sterile but this man was not…he said when we had decided he would return…we never saw him again and when we asked the nurses about him no one knew who he was….they gave me a weird look and my mom because we both talked to this guy….then when I saw this picture of Jesus I about lost it because this man looked exactly like Jesus…I don’t know if this man was an angel unaware, Jesus or just a concerned person working in the hospital admin office…but still leaves room to wonder…\n\n","date":"September 30, 2013 at 12:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
