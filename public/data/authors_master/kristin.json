I am curious about the type of NDE he would have too! He was a scary person, and I was pretty young and naive. Thank you for your response. : ).","date":"2012-02-15","mins":"11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-8254","author":"kristin","post":"Many years ago I was trying to end a tumultuous relationship with a dangerous man. I did not know when entering into that relationship that he was a dangerous criminal with a long record. I found out in a rather scary and traumatic way, when we were actually engaged to be married. (I wont go into that part.) I will tell you that “ending it” provoked stalking in him. He followed me wherever I moved. He would leave a rose at the door step, a voice recording telling me how he couldn’t live without me many other things over a two year period of time. After about two years of dealing with frequent moves and the terrifying stalking I finally thought I had gotten him to leave me alone and things were pretty good for me. I had a new boyfriend who I really liked, a new place to live, and a great job.. One evening as my new boyfriend and I were watching a movie I heard a tapping at the window behind me. When I turned to look I saw my ex (the stalkers) face in the darkness practically pressed up into the glass. He was so angry and had a weird grin on his face and he just kept tapping the window. Apparently my room mate came home and he walked around to the front of the house, he explained to her that he was an old friend of mine and asked if she could let him in. She did. Not a good thing. He was a forth degree black belt and he had my new boyfriend by the neck in two seconds flat. He asked him if we had “been romantic” to put it nicely. He said if we had been romantic he was going to kill him right then. I ran, he chased me..you get the idea it wasn’t pretty. And sadly, the stalking didn’t end on this day….but something miraculous DID happen on this day after he left. I was very tired, and traumatized and went into my room to cry and lay down. I fell asleep….., apparently into a very deep sleep because a couple people had been trying to call me and I didn’t even hear the phone ring. Weird considering the phone was right next to my head on the bed side table. I found myself in a place (all white light) I was initially confused…and I thought to myself “Wait a minute where am I?” Just as I thought where am I , my thought was answered telepathically. I felt warmth, love, (so much love all around me) I felt souls around me in back of me but didn’t see them (or myself actually.) I was sort of just floating there in the light “talking” telepathically with someone. I remember feeling like maybe it isn’t my time, but enjoyed the feeling so much I didn’t want to leave.(It really feels so joyful and peaceful nothing can compare here on earth, not even the birth of a child, a marriage or other precious blessings.) I think I was shown my life how it “would be” and how a husband and kids would be part of it. I believe I felt my love for them before I even knew them in a physical sense. I remember choosing to leave so I could meet them and go on with my life, I heard telepathically (But clearer and sharper than words on earth) It isn’t your time…you were brought here because you needed to know everything will be okay, it will turn out Okay.” I woke with such peace…peace beyond what a dream could bring. I “knew” everything would be okay…someone told me in heaven. And guess what? The stalking stopped (I should be dead.) And I have been happily very happily married for 16 years February 18th, to a true sweetheart of a man, with four great kids together. Everything turned out better than okay. I will never forget that experience…I don’t know what happened that day, but I believe the trauma triggered an NDE. I would be interested to know what others opinions are on that….","date":"2012-02-14","mins":"10:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-8297","author":"kristin","post":"Hi Rebecca, Thank you so much for sharing your amazing story with me. It sounds as if you were protected on that day and Jesus listened to you when you called for him. I wonder, did your ex husband also change his ways permanently after this happened? How are you and your children doing now? Thank you again for sharing..:).","date":"2012-02-15","mins":"12:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-8295","author":"kristin","post":"Hi Dianne, Thank you for sharing your beautiful experience,You have have named the light perfectly. Bliss is a perfect word to describe it. Thank you for your perspective on my experience, and yes, that experience did influence my decisions and life a great deal. I am internally calm and quite content. The day I met my husband I had a very warm, loving feeling come over me suddenly. I heard a voice say “You are going to meet the man you are going to marry today.” He walked in 5 minutes after that voice popped in my head. It seems angels and God are never far away, they whisper and guide you all through this life. And it is possible to feel and hear them on occasion!.","date":"2012-02-15","mins":"12:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-8304","author":"kristin","post":"Wow Annie, You must really have a purpose here on earth. That is a incredible story! It seems people who have a story of divine intervention, usually have many don’t you think? I also have many other times that were intervened upon in my life. Including one where I was attacked in a parking lot when I was 19….of course things turned out OK. It is very interesting to hear everyone’s stories and it affirms my faith in Jesus and his Angels!.","date":"2012-02-15","mins":"1:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-8298","author":"kristin","post":"Hi Annie This is how my father saw it too (from your perspective almost exactly.) Thank you for your perspective, and everything you said rings true to me. Your words are beautifully written, and touched me. You most certainly should share my story with a friend if you think it will help her.

I ran across it many times but never picked it up. I have a 3 yr old son who was diagnosed with leukemia Dec. 2 2009. I am always busy and stay in the hospital for periods at a time. I dont know if it seemed to hit too close to home or what the case was but i didnt run to buy the book. I decided to buy the book recently. I sat to read it while my 3 children ran around playing and being loud. I was able to finish the book and had different thoughts about it. I was wanting to believe it and love it , but I also thought this boy seems to share all his fathers literal thoughts in his visions. My son, Evan , who had turned 3 yrs old only 2 weeks before ran by just then. I laughed at my own thought , thinking haha, yeah i should show him the picture of the Prince of Peace. Evan ran by again , his sisters chasing him , he laughed. I grabbed his hand and said, hey baby come here. He slowed down , I held the book out opened to the picture. He looked at the page of the picture of P Rince of Peace and then at the other that had a few pictures of family members of Colton. I looked at him , looked at his eyes to see a reaction. His eyes gazed back at the picture and said thats GOD AND MARY. I felt numb. I said , what baby …what did you say… He said, dats God … Mary … dats God mom. And just like that he ran offf. Now , i do happen to be Catholic and I pray often to our Blessed Mother. For my son to associate God and Mary seems to be for my benefit or my comfort, but i know i did not coach him or bait him. Matter of fact i asked thinking…. What the h… why not ask, and even laughed. My 3 yr old son could have said anything , anyone…or just ran off but he said GOD and Mary..","date":"2012-02-16","mins":"11:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
