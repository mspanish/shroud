{"misc":[{"id":"comment-4146","author":"jo","post":"Leonardo da Vinci was illumanti, he forged the Turin cloth for the Catholic church so they could continue to treat Christs followers as idiots. I saw a documentary where the photographic techniques he used were duplicated, he used the body from the morgue (he quite often used to get bodies for dissecting). He used his own face – this has been proved because the spaces between eyes, nose etc & other features of the face are like finger prints & can’t be forged. Now that these facts have been discovered the Catholic church has locked the Turin cloth away & won’t let anyone exam it. The implications of this is that every image you see of Jesus Christ in statues & paintings all over the world in religious institutions & churches are actually images of Leonardo da Vinci. So people are using his image in their prayers etc. Satanists like to make Christians untruthful even if they are not aware of it – it gives them energy. The Last Supper is also a da Vinci picture which they are now analyzing & saying that there are clues in it to say that Jesus & Mary Magdalene had a child. They are trying to make the da Vinci code bullshit a reality. This is a set up to declare that the antichrist (Prince William) is actually a descendant of Jesus! The Mona Lisa is also a self portrait of Da Vinci – now you know why she has that smirk on her face, Da Vinci must have thought he was so smart. The Catholic church has been planning this for hundreds of years. I have a saying for satanists “If they can’t beat it they take it over” & this is exactly what happened with the Catholic church. Read how the Catholic church was 1st formed in Rome & don’t believe any of there bullshit..","date":"2011-10-08","mins":"6:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/29/leonardo-da-vinci-forged-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Leonardo da Vinci Forged the Shroud of Turin?"}]}
