{"history":[{"id":"comment-9930","author":"arimathean","post":"“The original Edessa story recounts an image of Christ made by Christ prior to His crucifixion.” Actually, that was not the original story but a later revision. The earliest version of the story involved only a letter written by Christ in reply to Abgar’s request. The letter itself was regarded as a holy artifact in Edessa, and words from the letter were inscribed on churches and other buildings and gates of the city as a talisman. Later versions of the story were reworked to feature the image of Edessa. (My source for this is J. Segal’s book, Edessa: The Blessed City.).","date":"2012-04-03","mins":"8:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/16/christs-holy-image-of-edessaclarifying-the-confusion/","cat":"history","title":"Christ’s Holy Image of Edessa–Clarifying the Confusion"}]}
