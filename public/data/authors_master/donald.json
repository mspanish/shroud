The hard part is not to amplify what you don’t want and only amplify what you want (endogenous DNA vs contamination).” It is doubtful that good DNA analyses can be obtained from the Shroud.\nAs for what you guys think of what I see or don’t see, I don’t care, my opinion has been accepted by many in the past, including courts, so frankly I rather tend to think that here on this site I am only up against a bunch of religious contraries who would do and say anything to justify their beliefs even if that means not believing a truth when it is put in front of them.\nI am not so blind yet that I cannot tell a sword from a broomstick, already hundreds of others have emailed me to tell me that they too see the sword and the light shinning of it; so thankfully I can now claim to be one of many, not just the only one.\nAlso I might add that with regards the blood, when looking at the “hair” on the image with the face, (which is not really his hair, but some kind of a hood) the “blood” streaks down “towards”  his face.\nHow can this be when everybody knows that first everybody knows that at that time Jesus was dead and his heart was not pumping and Jesus body was laid to rest in a prone position and then washed clean. there should be no blood whatsoever; If anything the streak should be towards one side or another of his face, not towards the chin. Again forensics will tell you this is wrong, it cannot be.\nAnd frankly, that is only one streak, why is the rest on top of the hair/hood? there are no other signs of cuts or abrasion to the head at all, not one.\nthen there is the thoracic cavity … what a joke that is … please, that is really a laugh.\nHere is a link to an over-expanded view of the face and body, please mark the blood streaks for me and show me cause to believe that is his hair and not a hood. I could tell you why I know it is not hair, a question of both gravity and the prone position of the body but I’ll wait for your answer first.\nhttp://wisdomblogsdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/shroudofturinextralarge.jpg?w=1000&h=1927\nalso .. the bodies are not the same .. the image with the face has wider hips, I checked and measured it. why don’t you do the same before replying, just make sure you use the original negative.. my zooms are of different size.    :-)\n\n","date":"December 4, 2011 at 7:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/03/when-it-comes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-he-doesnt-know-his-backside-from-a-knight-in-shining-armor/","cat":"image_theory","title":"When it comes to the Shroud of Turin he doesn’t know his backside from a knight in shining armor"},{"author":"donald","post":"Actually judging by what little research I’ve done it has become obvious to me that nobody has ever proven there is true blood on the cloth.\nAs an example .. “And later on, there was even some DNA tests on blood samples coming from the Shroud proving once more that the blood is human and even male. ”\nSo what were previous tests done on, toilet paper? Dr. Andrew Merriwether  clearly stated it, “NO DNA test is possible on such an old piece of rug” … I did not say this, but somebody who tested the shroud sure did.\nBut regardless, considering the history of the thing it is not only more than likely that the whole thing is a fraud (although I do not dispute that the image is authentic) and still …\nI notice that you guys like to change the subject quite a bit; you haven’t answered a single question I put to you yet, what are you, mindless fools or something? … \nSo I shall ask a positive question here, … have any of you ever done any tests on the shroud yourself or is it possible that you, like many others, are all nothing but complete stupid fools who are willing to believe any bullshit you are told and remain mindless donkeys praying to a old rug?\n(just a bit of self defense here seeing as how you ignorant idiots like to show your complete lack of education by insulting complete strangers)\nI’d call you dickheads but that would be too rude, so stuff your vigour, I’ve come to the conclusion that you are nothing but morons yourselves, you’d have to be to rely on the things you mention. \nhave a nice day.\n\n","date":"December 5, 2011 at 12:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/03/when-it-comes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-he-doesnt-know-his-backside-from-a-knight-in-shining-armor/","cat":"image_theory","title":"When it comes to the Shroud of Turin he doesn’t know his backside from a knight in shining armor"},{"author":"donald","post":"Hope you guys don’t mind if I defend myself a bit here….. nice site \nFirst, the picture I used was from wiki, in the public domain, they say so at the bottom of their site, the one you use here is mine, did you ask me if you could use it?  , don’t forget to send me either an apology or $5000 bucks for using my “very expensive” work which took effort to produce and post for my readers, not yours.  I check for copyright on all the pictures on my site, so should you. :-(\nFive minutes is a lot of work you know, you shouldn’t steal from me in that manner, I thought you guys were Christians, that is hard to believe considering how much you insult me here.\nI rather take the money but if you can’t afford it then just give $5 to charity and then come on over to my site and leave there a nice apologetic comment, kiss butt and all that.\nNah, I’m just kidding you guys, I’m an Aussie and we always stir, don’t let it bother you  :-)\nSecond, I did nothing to the picture, I took the one from wiki, opened it with Photo Editor and then clicked on the “Negative Effect”, I didn’t colour it in any way, it is an exact job as that which was done by scientists in the past. you can do it yourselves if you wish.\nSecondly, I am blind, that is why I zoomed it. but I did nothing else so ….\nCan you see the sword or not? already I have had hundreds of emails from others telling me they do. personally I wish they didn’t as I am religious, I believe in God and Jesus and wish it were a picture of Jesus but it isn’t; I have a lot more evidence on this but why post it, I only posted enough to generate discussion and no more..\nI certainly never expected to be libeled as well by been called a “Moron” online .. considering I am a scientist I take offense to that too .. maybe … nah, I’ll let that one slide.\nThankfully I would never breach God’s trust by worshiping a piece of rug and turning it into a religion icon which just happens to be against the second commandment.
