{"opinion":[{"id":"comment-27199","author":"piero_&_afm","post":"First of all : the exact italian name is Linoli (Odoardo) and not Lonoli … My interest is in the textile field and my old idea (1998) to control the linen fibrils using the advanced the SP Ms (= Scanning Probe Microscopies… and working, for example : with the three point bending tests and also with the controls about the cellulosic DP) can also be useful in the biological domain … because we can study the relics in a better manner with all the adequate tools for SPM investigations (= Applied Structural Mechanics and Applied Nanotechnology). Under the address : http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/mir/lanciano.html we can read the following words : >In 1970 ’71 and taken up again partly in 1981 there took place a scientific investigation by the most illustrious scientist Prof. Odoardo Linoli, eminent Professor in Anatomy and Pathological Histology and in Chemistry and Clinical Microscopy. He was assisted by Prof. Ruggero Bertelli of the University of Siena. >The analyses were conducted with absolute and unquestionable scientific precision and they were documented with a series of microscopic photographs. Instead under : http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/physician tells of eucharistic miracle of lanciano we can read : >Linoli extracted parts of the relics with great care and then analyzed the remains of “miraculous flesh and blood.” He presented his findings on March 4, 1971. >His study confirmed that the flesh and blood were of human origin. The flesh was unequivocally cardiac tissue, and the blood was of type AB. >Consulted by ZENIT, Linoli explained that “as regards the flesh, I had in my hand the endocardium. Therefore, there is no doubt at all that it is cardiac tissue.” >In regard to the blood, the scientist emphasized that “the blood group is the same as that of the man of the holy Shroud of Turin In any case the possible key to solve the enigma of Lanciano (apart the Faith) is the DNA analysis. But I remember that an ancient DNA can be very difficult to control … So … How to see the scientific truth ? In the past (in Civitavecchia, Italy) the statue of Mary was weeping tears of blood. Perhaps this happened because Jesus is her only Son and She wants us to follow him. But (clearly) this is not a scientific explanation and we don’t know what is the scientific answer from the new intruments. — — — Sorry. I am not an expert in the field of coagulation/fibrinolysis of normal blood and pathological blood. I am only curious to know where are located the Labs interested in these particular experiments. — — I have found a vague bibliographic reference : S. Thalhammer, W.M. Heckl (2004) : Atomic Force Microscopy as a tool in nanobiology But I don’t agree with idea to do the nano destructions. See for example the previous work : R. Stark, S. Thalhammer, J. Wienberg, W.M. Heckl (1998): The AFM as a tool for chromosomal dissection – the influence of physical parameters.

So … You have to take into account that now (on Turin Shroud) we can only control the bloodstains (on linen) of a (presumed) deceased person. What is the meaning of that thromboelastography in a dead person ? In any case … I want to respect the sacred blood of Jesus ! See also (for the blood and the cardiac muscle) : the famous Miracle of Lanciano (and the old analyses by Dr. Linoli) ! The blood turned out as a true blood (of Jesus. But, until now, we have not yet seen an interesting plan about the DNA analyses for the true cardiac muscle) ! Instead, in my opinion, we have to control the linen fibrils using the advanced tools, using the SP Ms (= Scanning Probe Microscopies)… — — Why we are not yet able to do that “very simple” operation ? For example : Atomic Force Microscopy (= AFM) is a tool not only to image the topography, but also provides valuable information regarding adhesion and surface density using force curves ! — — It is very simple to test the linen fibrils under an adequate probe in an AFM three point bending test ! If you have some exact knowledge in the field of Structural Mechanics you can work with good gains … and you can also explore (in a non destructive manner) the biological traces. Am I wrong in my old ideas (= 1998) about these Secrets ? — — What will be the result from the controls for the Ancient Secrets of the Bible (and then see also : the SPM controls about the papyrus of Qumran, a more exact way to test these ancient reperts) under the SP Ms survey ?.","date":"2013-03-11","mins":"1:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/10/old-video-ancient-secrets-of-the-bible-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Old Video: Ancient Secrets of the Bible – The Shroud of Turin"}]}
