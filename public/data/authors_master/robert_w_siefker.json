While some evidence has been offered in support of the reweave hypothesis there are important counter arguments.  Among the latter is the fact that the textile experts who were involved in the 2002 Shroud conservation project examined the sample area and reported they could not identify or find explicit evidence of any reweaving.  Also, TSC has carefully studied the X-ray and transmitted light photographs taken by STURP of the sample area and has seen no evidence of reweaving in this type of imagery.  TSC thinks the negative evidence for reweaving is difficult to overcome and that the ultimate answer to the anomalous radiocarbon testing result lies elsewhere.”The conclusion that the Shroud was in Constantinople in 1204 is strongly supported, both historically and empirically.  Such a conclusion means the radiocarbon dating of the sample cut from the Shroud failed to date the Shroud correctly. However, why the radiocarbon dating of the 1988 single sample cut from the Shroud did not properly date the Shroud’s true age remains a valid unresolved question that merits continued research.  TSC is most interested in exploring “enhanced contamination” other than that associated with a reweave.  Others are encouraged to continue to investigate the reweave hypothesis.","date":"November 22, 2015 at 9:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis"},{"author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"Jackson did not ever say there was no disturbance to the corner of the Shroud in question used for the radiocarbon “dating” of the Shroud.

Our goal in creating this document has been to provide a “fair” introduction to the Shroud for new inquirers based on the perspective of an organization that has been studying the Shroud for a long time. TSC is well known to be an organization that represents a judgment of “authentic” for the Shroud. Dan currently has a judgment of “probably” authentic. We both may change our judgments in the future.

One minor correction is that it is not an axiom of Jackson’s hypothesis that a body can become instantaneously mechanically transparent.  Jackson nor does anybody else have any explanation for how that might be the case. Jackson has stated the following: “My concern as early as 1976, fourteen years before the 1990 paper, was one of physics – how to reconcile the 3-d characteristic of the Shroud image with its high resolution.  I described this concern mathematically in a paper for the Proceedings of the 1977 United States Conference of Research on the Shroud of Turin entitled, ‘A problem of resolution posed by the existence of a three-dimensional image on the Shroud.”  This problem, in fact, persists to this day as can be seen from the Image Characteristics versus Image Formation Hypothesis Table of the Critical Summary; compare rows B2.0 (High Resolution) and B3.0 (3-Dimensional) for which no hypothesis, except the Radiation Fall-Through hypothesis, is indicated as simultaneously satisfying both image criteria.  Moreover, a careful reading of the 1990 paper will show that the logic of the Radiation Fall-Through hypothesis does not, in any way, depend upon or require an assumption arising from Christian theology; rather, the logic arises strictly from what is observed on the Shroud of Turin image.”  Jackson’s hypothesis proves nothing.  It is one image formation hypothesis among many.  It is fair to attack it with good solid arguments.  We don’t think there are any yet.  You be the judge.","date":"November 18, 2015 at 1:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"It is a very good recommendation to read this interview. TSC is very familiar with this fine discussion. Thank you Louis for pointing out this resource.  Dr. Di Lazzaro is deeply respected for his fine work by John Jackson and the TSC organization.  In many respects he represents the best of the emerging next generation of outstanding scientists who are contributing to the scientific examination of the Shroud. We think Paolo would not say his research on double superficiality makes Jackson’s hypothesis “no longer viable.”  At most, if Paolo is right in his interpretation, he would be able to say that the double superficiality prediction of Jackson’s hypothesis must be rethought.  If he is right then the rating of the double-superficiality “image characteristic”  (Item C3.0 as listed in the Critical Summary) must be changed. That is to be determined.  Even doing this however leaves Jackson’s hypothesis being very viable indeed, relative to other hypotheses. You will note in the Critical Summary references that we have included Paolo and Ghiberti’s objections to double superficiality. There is honest debate. TSC’s judgment is that  Fanti and Maggiolo are correct about double-superficiality. Regardless Jackson’s hypothesis remains viable.","date":"November 18, 2015 at 6:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"Louis, your comments are appreciated.","date":"November 18, 2015 at 7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"Well said Louis.","date":"November 18, 2015 at 8:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"Dear Dan, your blog has always challenged us ‘authenticists” to work harder to provide better arguments and better research.  That has been a very important contribution. Someone in a comment above stated that we have kind of reached a stalemate.  That is true of course.  If the Shroud is authentic then one might ask why has it remained such an enigma?  Why wouldn’t providence simply make it absolutely clear?  It didn’t and it probably won’t. Maybe the Shroud is just a knock at the door. Is it a sign? The answer appears to be “you decide.”  For our generation you have done as well as any to promote the discussion.  You are to be saluted.

As clearly stated at the top of the chart with the word “judged”, this is TSC’s analysis. We have included only 17 image characteristics because we think that these seventeen, in and of themselves, can be used to evaluate image formation hypotheses that have gained at least some traction through the years.  The chart itself does not stand alone.  Appendix 1 gives our reasoning for each mark. Again it is judgment and if the image characteristics are indeed true, as we judge them to be, understandable to anyone.  We also state that the The fall-through hypothesis cannot be tested or proven.  In fact it is a very “unscientific” explanation as we acknowledge in its description and in the Conclusion.

Reading the reference to Giulio Fanti’s, et al’s work on research in this area is important.  There is a full length chapter in his new book on the topic.  Well worth the read.Certainly one may well justifiably judge the evidence of the Solidus coin as coincidence, or not even that strongly. It can in fact be justifiably judged to have not significant at all to the question of the provenience of the Shroud. The bigger issue however is context.  If for instance, like Dan, you judge the Pray Manuscript to “probably” not be a coincidence then that judgment throws light on other items of evidence. This is why context is just as important as drilling down with an all or nothing focus on a singular item of evidence.  Just one judgment of “probably” (or stronger) on one item in a long chain of pre 1204 Shroud evidence changes one’s entire perspective. Now everything pre 1204 is looked at differently including a justified judgment that the Solidus coin isn’t just coincidence.","date":"October 23, 2015 at 2:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/22/available-critical-summary-version-3-0/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Available: Critical Summary Version 3.0"},{"author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"Hugh, things can devolve very quickly as your comments show.  There needs to be some trust in other’s integrity.  Absent that, no dialogue can take place.  Of course, all that you have said in your comment could be true.  But it isn’t.  The fall-through hypothesis is not an agenda driven hypothesis. All that TSC can do is state that fact and hope that reasonable people will evaluate it on the merits.  We would suggest that as a start interested individuals read the recent forward to the fall-through hypothesis that is posted on the TSC website (www.shroudofturin.com) as well as the fall-through hypothesis itself which is also posted there. TSC is in fact very open to other hypotheses. We are yet to be convinced that any that follow “conventional physics” are adequate. The first problem is methodological naturalism. None of Jesus’s reported miracles can be explained by standard physics. Reason – – it is proposed – – cannot know such truths.  Thus all special revelation and the “mighty works of God” are ruled out in the realm of reality known by reason and are only preserved in the secondary  realm of subjective “irrational” faith. Jackson acknowledges this in the forward mentioned above. Yet he has persisted. He knows he will be the target of statements like “made-up physics can explain anything.”   The second problem of course is the Shroud itself.","date":"October 27, 2015 at 4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/26/dan-spicer-we-have-a-simple-explanation/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Dan Spicer:  We have a simple explanation."},{"author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"TSC is very interested in Dan Spicer’s hypothesis.  We include a comment on his and E.T. Toton’s work in the Critical Summary.  A “naturalistic” image formation process should be able to be modeled experimentally. Fanti and his team have done a lot of work on their CD hypothesis and that should be applauded. We continue to think however that over time and even with great effort naturalistic explanations will fall short of a demonstration and that “judgment” will always be the last word with the Shroud.  As we state in the conclusion to the Critical Summary the latest naturalistic hypotheses, including Fanti’s and Dan Spicer’s are all forcing hypotheses that stress the limits of believable, although possibly less than the fall-through hypothesis.  What can be concluded is that something very very remarkable happened to form the image on the Shroud. The image on the Shroud remains best described as an “impossible” image. The fall-through hypothesis fits the data of the image characteristics.  Individuals will have to “judge” what that means.  The image characteristics included in the Critical Summary closely follow the lead of G. Fanti’s “Compendium” as noted in our references. Why these image characteristics are important, and why we have focused on them, is because we think they are sufficient to rule out any artistic hypothesis (respectfully yours too Colin).","date":"October 26, 2015 at 1:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/26/dan-spicer-we-have-a-simple-explanation/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Dan Spicer:  We have a simple explanation."},{"author":"robert_w_siefker","post":"“If” the blood was transferred to the cloth before the image then it is TSC’s judgment that any subsequent artistic effort to create an image would leave evidence at the boundary of blood and serum retraction rings. No such evidence has been found. To the contrary the boundary between image and blood has shown remarkable coordination in the areas observed. The colored image fibers are colored up to the boundary. There is no evidence of a coloring agent being applied beyond the boundary, i.e. paint being applied beyond the boundary over the blood.  If the artistic method was a bas relief using a heated object then the blood areas would be damaged or even obliterated.  Microscopic observations of the Shroud blood areas have not shown any degradation due to heat with the notable exception  at the intersection of bloodstains with fire damage to the Shroud from the 1532 fire.
