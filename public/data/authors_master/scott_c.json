{"resources":[{"id":"comment-83119","author":"scott_c","post":"Yannick, I am not sure I understand your response here, but let me say that obviously some elements of the shroud comport with a natural explanation (e.g. Blood, age of the cloth material). Furthermore, there may be some natural explanations for the image in terms of explaining the actual physical phenomena of it. But if the image reflects that of an actual corpse, the question seems to be whether the image could have been caused by a corpse which was later removed by natural causes (e.g. The corpse taken out of the shroud by other people) or if it was caused by a uniquely unrepeatable, un testable and thus un falsifiable method beyond the pale of any scientific explanation. IOW, if the image was caused by a supernatural occurrence, then it is not possible for scientific methods to determine that. It may be able to determine some of the phenomena of the image itself but not what materially caused it if it was not the result of a natural occurrence. Since science can only account for natural explanations and not supernatural ones, there is a limit to scientific inquiry if in fact the image was caused supernaturally. That then takes us to a philosophical discussion about miracles. Unfortunately, many scientists are methodological naturalists and rule out of hand any supernatural explanations for certain types of phenomena that may occur..","date":"2014-02-27","mins":"2:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/26/giulio-fantis-book-launched/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti’s Book Launched"}]}
