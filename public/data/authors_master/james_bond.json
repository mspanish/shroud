I find your responses interesting and informative and take them under advisement when searching out what’s really true or not. But again, we have this piece of linen with the faint negative image that has 3 D information in it (no other man made painting or medium can do that) and that the closer you get to it the more it disappears rather than getting more detail to view. There’s just too much there to just toss it off as some sort of Middle Age fake. It surely begs the question as to why. No artist has come forth claiming that he/she did it all during the MA era – you would think that one would. There’s no signature on the linen as to who the artist is whereas all painting from that time forward always has the artist’s name or logo or something.

Apparently the image was created with a flash of radiation of some sort (in the seminar it was proposed the flash had an intensity of 94 Hiroshima atom bombs with a duration of several picoseconds, the math was intriguing to say the least). The puzzling thing is the way the image is on the linen; it’s not a scorch of some sort but yet a discoloration of the fiber. Where there is more close discoloration of fibers that gives the apparent appearance of being denser which it’s not; all discoloration is on the top one or two microns of the fiber. The question would then be: what caused that discoloration? It’s not carbon as in a burn nor is it a pigment of any sort. I look forward to this discussion with you.

The thing I brought away from the three day Pasco, WA conference is: the TS seems more legitimate than a MA forgery in that a forgery means there is an original somewhere that this TS has been forged from. Other things included (there were nineteen listed) was image formation. The image was basically scorched on the linen not unlike an iron scorching material. Another thing is that the image is only one or two microns thick, laying on top of the fibers and not into the thread. Then of course the negative image; in MA times that concept wasn’t known then. The 14 C carbon dating group went into the investigation already determining in their minds that the TS is a fake (different from a forgery) and intended to prove it which they did, tossing data that didn’t agree with their preconception of the age. (There was a whole hour dedicated to 14 C dating that was used and was presented by several different scientists there). In sum total I believe that the TS is not a fake based on what the seminar produced. I respect your opinions and what I am doing now is going out and searching those, such as yourself, as to why they think the TS is a fraud. I like to investigate both sides of the argument. Again, bottom line: the image is not a painting or any other medium used to produce a very faint image that has to be viewed from a distance to even see any discernible image and the closer you get the image just disappears whereas in a painting or photograph the image becomes more distinct the closer you get. The only reason you can see anything now is that the image is produced with a higher contrast so that you can see it otherwise in just natural light all you can see is a faint smudge. All the attempts at copying and trying to reproduce a similar image has failed because paint or some other medium is used not a radiation burn such as is on the cloth. Thank you again and I look forward to your replies. James R.

I’m saying there was some sort of bias where their minds were already made up and then went on to prove it. The Arizona data was thrown out because their data was too far outside what they considered the norm to be and just use the other two labs’ data. The whole thing about the TS to me is there is no discernible method of how the image could be produced without any sort of pigments. The image lays on top of the fibers not in the threads and density is not coloration placed heavily on top of one another fiber but just more densely packed as in more coloration next to but not on top. The front and back (dorsal) images of the crucified man are negative images and contain 3 D or topographical information content related to the distance of the cloth from the body. Of the 100 to 200 fibers in a thread, the images result from only the top one or two layers of fibers in a thread being discolored. The thickness of discoloration in a fiber is less than 0.4 microns, which is less than a wavelength of light. There is no indication of capillarity (soaking up of a liquid) between the fibers or the threads. The discolored regions of the fibers in the image result from a change in the covalent bonding of the carbon atoms that were originally in the cellulose molecules in the linen. This change in the covalent bonding of the carbon atoms is equivalent to a dehydration and oxidation of the cellulose molecule. The conclusion is that an artist or forger could not have produced the bizarre characteristics of the images in any era, either ancient or modern. If you’ll also notice that if the image is a fraud and used as some sort of icon or religious artifact then why, in all the paintings of Christ crucified/hanging on the Cross are all the nail holes painted into/onto the palms whereas on the Shroud image the nail holes are in the wrist. Surely a religious painter or whoever created the Shroud would have also put nail holes in the palms and not right behind the hand where the body could be hung from without tearing out of the palms. Okay, some folks would argue that He was held up with ropes is why the nails didn’t rip out but then again it comes back to where the nail holes are on the Shroud and where all religious paintings bar none have the nail holes in the hands. If you would consider yourself an investigator would you really want to slip out without being noticed because you disagreed with one point or other that was made? Also unobtrusively as possible really wouldn’t have been necessary since people were getting up all during presentations without anyone caring. I did it several times myself when some of the foreign (Spanish, Italian) presenters’ accents were difficult to understand so I went outside and caught up things on them later. The whole point of this exercise to me is: I like to see what proponents of a Middle Age image/painting/whatever believe vs those that believe that there’s an image of a crucified man on a linen cloth. I’m not saying it’s Jesus on there but there’s been no other crucifixion with similar injuries such as Shroud Man. You mentioned the scourging – The Shroud shows 100 to 120 scourge marks from two Roman flagrum, one striking from each side, with dumbbell shaped weights on the ends of the straps. The blood marks from these wounds show blood serum rings (visible only under UV) around the dried blood exudation. There’s been no record prior to the 1500’s that showed the TS as being venerated as an icon or anything like that, the reason being it was hidden in different families households since around AD600 and was known however to have been in Constantinople. Anyway, it is interesting to see the disagreements from other sources and I value your input.

The two most common explanations of the Shroud are: 1) It is a forgery made between 1260 to 1390 AD, based on the C14 dating, probably made in northern France, and 2) It is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus from about 33 AD. Note that several of the above items are inconsistent with the Shroud being a forgery from the Middle Ages. A forger would not have known to: Place invisible serum rings around the blood exudate of the scourge marks. Add pollen to the Shroud that is unique to the Jerusalem area. Add pollen around the head that is from a plant with long thorns. Put a microscopic amount of dirt in abrasions on the nose and one knee. Put bilirubin into the blood. Locate the nails in the wrists or fold the thumbs under, contrary to paintings from the Middle Ages. Put microscopic chips of limestone from Jerusalem into dirt near the feet.
