It is written about the 1988 testing and the Shroud with its implications as I see them.\n~ Andy\n————–\nSince the carbon dating of 1988 has been shown in several ways to fail to represent the date of the Shroud and since they abandoned their protocols, I don’t see the point of continuing to discuss this unreliable dating.  It is essentially meaningless and has no bearing on the Shroud.  \nConsidering the abandoning of the scientific protocols, it would seem logical it was done purposefully for whatever reason, most likely to cast doubt on the Shroud and to try to influence many to disregard it altogether as a hoax despite the fact that 99% of the evidence points to its authenticity and evidence to the contrary is minimal, at best.  The test itself is unreliable and when the other evidence contradicts a carbon dating of just about any artifact, the carbon dating is always set aside, except with regard to the Shroud.  \nThis is not surprising considering the controversy it naturally engenders.  After all, it is a relic of not only history, science, art, etc., but also of religion.  That last category makes many squirm because it requires something of the one who faces it.  If it is truly the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, then one is responsible for what one does with that information.  Suppressing it is much easier than admitting the possibility and facing it and its implications.  Yet I have always found honesty with myself and whatever I face is the best policy for me to take.\n\n","date":"May 9, 2013 at 6:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/09/the-carbon-dating-of-the-the-shroud-will-we-ever-know-what-really-happened/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Carbon Dating of the the Shroud: Will we ever know what really happened?"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"\nMatthias :\n“Nor would the leaders of the movement live, die, suffer torture and martyrdom for an invented story.\nI used to think this, now I am not 100% sure.

I think it is conceivable that the early supporters might have risked their lives because they believed in Jesus and his movement and its cause, even if they knew that the story of his resurrection was metaphor.\nHowever, whether the supporters of Jesus were downtrodden enough to make this theory potentially compelling is a big question. If Jesus’s early supporters in the 30s and 40s came from extremely downtrodden backgrounds then this might be feasible, but my understanding is that they were not oppressed in an extreme sense, in a way that would be motivating to risk their lives for a revolutionary cause .\nSo on balance, although interested in the “invented myth”, I  am not compelled by it.\n\nUntil you read the stories of those who went to their deaths for the so-called myth.

If you were to read several papers and books on the matter, you will find that much of what is written in the linked-page above is FACT. I won’t state that a ‘switch’ was performed but alot of the other points made, are in fact, TRUE. As I’ve stated several times before on this blog, the c14 testing was a complete fiasco and I arrived at this conclusion not on my own, but by researching and reading. All or most of where I acquired this info can be found at shroud.com or you can read “The Rape of the Shroud” by William Meacham. I don’t believe there is any proof to a substitution, but there is evidence of a stunning lax in protocols, procedures etc; Things such as the samples being split into smaller pieces by the labs, and actually too “below minimum threshold weight for proper testing”, no official photos of said samples when received at the labs, no proper examination of the samples before cleaning, BASIC cleaning methods used, “not neccessarily efficient for linen samples of a unknown provenance or history” , and finally to the unorthodox communications between labs before results were published or even while testing was in progress!! Moreover, and yes to the non-peer-reviewed release of the Nature paper. In actuality the final results have still not been released, even till this day, to the Turin Archdiocese!\nPapers you may want to read; ‘Evidence is not proof: A Response to Timothy Jull’ by Mark Oxley and ‘Radiocarbon Dating the Shroud of Turin: A Nature report’ by Remi Van Haelst, just to name a couple. These amongst others can be found at Shroud.com under scientific papers.\nR\n\nThey completely ignored their protocols, Ron.  The carbon dating was not science, but voodoo magic to shed a disparaging light on the Shroud.  This has since been pointed out astutely by Sue Benford and Joe Marino and proven from the physical evidence by Ray Rogers.  Mechem’s book is excellent in this regard and he is an expert on carbon dating.\n\n","date":"August 27, 2012 at 7:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/27/was-this-page-removed-because-it-was-just-too-political/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Was this page removed because it was just too political?"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"To Gabriel ~ Considering the peculiar sample and the abandoning of the protocols for this testing, I suspect foul play just on that basis alone.

The Popes calling it an icon versus a relic means they are not pronouncing it as Jesus’ Shroud, but as an icon is is an image of Jesus’ Shroud, it still has great meaning even if one day one was able to scientifically prove it was not the burial Shroud of Jesus of Nazareth who was the Christ.  This is an important distinction.  But as Pope John Paul II said determining if this Shroud is the one that wrapped Jesus’ body is outside the competence of the Church, per say, but is rather left to the realm of science and the scientific study of this item because the Church’s realm, strictly speaking, is in regard to faith and morals, not science.\n\n","date":"April 1, 2013 at 7:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/stories-are-rolling-out-now-on-the-exhibition-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"event","title":"Stories are rolling out now on the Exhibition of the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"Thanks Joe.

Scientific study of the Shroud is important, not for the believer, but for those who doubt and for other experts.  So there are two issues here: faith and science.  Neither one is exclusive of the other nor do these two, faith and science, contradict one another.

The effect was much more different than that produced by scorching a cloth with a hot statue\n– Raymond N. Rogers and Anna Arnoldi, Scientific method applied to the Shroud of Turin – A Review, 2002 (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers2.pdf)\nMicroscopy proves that image fibers and scorch fibers are quite different in structure and composition. The distribution of color is different, even at the level of single fibers. The image was not formed by scorching the linen fibers. When viewed in parallel light under a microscope, a scorched fiber is colored through its entire diameter, and the medulla (a tubular void down the middle of the fiber) usually appears to be darker than the mass of the fiber as a result of reactions at its surface and its shorter radius of curvature. The medullas of image fibers do not show any coloration or charring. The medullas are usually clean and colorless. Fibers that were scorched in a fire in AD 1532 show some scorching in the medullas .\n– Raymond N.

That’s not very convincing to anyone except yourself and those who have already made up their minds without listening to the Church who does have the authority to state the teaching.  Ironic.  We could easily trace the barring of women’s ordination to the priesthood back to the fall of Eve and go from there.  \nThere’s no doubt Jesus was a human being – a MALE human being.  God chose to incarnate himself as a man, not a woman.  This is quite telling.  The Holy Spirit cannot contradict Church teaching on ordination or any other subject, Yannick, for the Church is guarded against error on faith and morals.  This subject most certainly fits into these categories.  Your statements show a serious lack of knowledge of Church teaching and how the Church works.  Attempting to ‘do church’ from a secular viewpoint leads one somewhere the Church will not go, your opinion notwithstanding.\nThere are obviously men and women and both are different and complementary – this is a misuse of Paul’s statement which had nothing to do with roles in the Church.

All the Apostles were probably married…\nSo, following my argumentation Andy, I ask you the question: Do you agree with me that it’s about time that the Church let the priest free to decide whether they want to get married or not ???\nThat’s a false statement, Yannick.  Read the following which shows clearly how the requirement of celibacy was from the times of Paul or before: The Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy by Christian Cochini, SJ (doctor of tehology and taught in many univeristies) & Celibacy in the Church: The Beginnings of a Discipline of Obligatory Continence for Clerics in East and West by Stefan Heid (German theologian consulted by the German bishops on many occasions).\nJesus never ordained women simply because women in his patriarcal society were considered on the same level than a dog (and this is not a joke!).  THIS IS THE HISTORIC TRUTH !  How in the world he could have taken a women in the group of the twelves ?  Never !  As I said, he would have been stone to death in Galilea on the first day and would never have reached Jerusalem !!!  This argument of yours Andy (which is the official argument of the Vatican that I have heard many times) is not fair at all for women because it does not take account of the historical context of Jesus time.  Sad to say but it’s an argument of men FOR men.  You would rarely see a free women agreeing with such an argument !\nRefusal to accept teaching of the Church means you are choosing to be outside the Church, my brother.  Why would you choose this?\nBut the main thing to understand is that such a question only concern the discipline inside the Church. In the end, it’s not that important because this is not what’s at the heart of Jesus message, which is : 1- Love God and 2- Love every humans.  Sticking too much on these disciplinary questions while not allowing any possibility of change can make people look like the Pharisees of Jesus time (i.e. close-minded people who preferred to follow the human tradition instead of God’s law, which is the law of LOVE and MERCY best described in the Sermon of the mount) and this closeness of mind is exactly what Christ has denonciate the most during his lifetime !\nAnd the fact is this : all those questions of disciple are free to EVOLVE with the evolution of mentality (I prefer to say “with the evolution of our humanity”) !!!  It’s wrong to think that all these questions are stuck in concrete and could never change !!!!  Remember that contesting the authority and the discipline of his Jewish religion was at the heart ofJesus message… \nLet’s evolve and stop thinking entirely and do whatever we want.  That is the thrust of your argument, my friend.\nAnd here’s the most important thing:  Once you put love into your reflection, things become very clear !  With the eyes of love, I think it becomes evident that there is no good reason why Women should not be ordained…  And here’s my main argument in favor of such a thing: THERE ARE WOMEN WHO RECEIVE THE CALL FOR PRIESTHOOD !!!!  Andy, don’t you understand that this is a sign from the Holy Spirit that it is about time that the Church allow the ordination of women  ???\nDo you mean aside from the fact that the Church which does have the authority to teach on faith and morals without error (there does not need to be an ex-cathedra statement) teaches the contrary of what you are stating here?  This is the Traditional and Scriptural truth for the Church is the ground and bulwark of truth.  Women cannot receive the call to priesthood because by definition, the very Church you claim needs to ordain women teaches this is not possible.  These views are nonsense for Catholics.\nAnd this is the same thing with the marriage of priests.  It is about time that the Church allow the freedom of choice !  This is untrue that all the priest are also called for celibacy…  One don’t necessarily goes with the other.\nI’m truly confident that one day (maybe not far from us) a new Pope (certainly not Benedict !!!) will make a great reform in the Church concerning all those disciplinary question that are truly secondary versus what’s at the heart of Jesus message.  I’ll end my comment with this important truth:  Believing that Jesus was the Son of God who revealed the true God of Love and Mercy is what makes us Christians, not our personal opinion on some disciplinary questions…\n\nMarried priests is a discipline of some of the Eastern Churches in union with the Pope and there is no issue with it.  But the fact remains as the two authors to which I refer above, celibacy was established very early in the Church.  May have this mistaken notion which is a pipe dream, not reality.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2012 at 9:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"Thanks Dave for the in-depth look at the Anglican ordination and the additional information.

I sill summarize your positions and provide responses.\n1) The teaching of the magisterium on this issue is not infallible and therefore open to discussion.\nResponse: We are required to hold the ordinary and extraordinary magisterial teachings of the Church.  The Vatican letter in reference to the recent removal of  John Bourgeous makes clear John Paul II gave definitive teaching on the subject in his letter. As such, one cannot validly dissent or hold a position other than this one.\n2) Not all traditions are immutable and therefore this one can change.\nResponse: As definitive teaching, this is not changeable. \n3) Christ chose to be male because it was the only way for him to exercise a ministry in the culture, otherwise he could have chosen either, so this is solely culturally conditioned (Gal 3:28).\nResponse: God knows all things and yet chose to come as a man, not a woman.  Jesus was not culturally bound which you have demonstrated well in showing how he broke with many Jewish restrictions.  This actually weakens your case and supports the fact that the choice to choose male disciples and following to ordain them to ministry (aforementioned breathing and giving the power to forgive sins only recorded to be given to the 11 & Matt 28:18-20 ‘teach all nations. baptizing…’).  Obviously this has nothing to do with cultural conditioning and has to do with the choice of the Son of God.  Your use of Gal 3:28 is arbitrary since the passage is not referring to any ordained ministry in the Church, but rather is general in scope and intent, \n4) Because the gospels were written by men and only record men being disciples, therefore this is biased and ought to be dismissed.  Further, Jesus has many interactions with women that broke with the norm and there are instances in Scripture where it might be implied that women were there.\nResponse: A charge that there was male bias has no grounds to substantiate itself and Gal 3:28 disproves the presumption.\nJesus interactions with women prove that what Jesus did was not culturally conditioned and actually disproves your point.  \nThe insinuation that when women are not mentioned that they are most likely there is an error called argument from silence.  This is not a valid point and will be completely disregarded and not considered again.  This a fantasy, flimsy as ever to support your desired notion that women ought to be ordained.  Any knowledgeable Catholic is aware the constant practice of the Church makes it unthinkable to question or change this practice.  It is well known that no woman has ever been ordained in the Catholic Church for any purpose.  This can also be seen in practice in the case of abortion, artificial means of contraception and many others.\n5)  John Bourgeous was disciplined and this does not support the immutability of this teaching.\nResponse: I agree, but I never made that point (straw man).  I refer you to the letter from the Vatican claiming [his “diffusion of teachings” opposed to the “definitive teaching of John Paul II and the Magisterium of the Catholic Church” as well as the “grave scandal” he has caused].

What makes us Christian is we were baptized and continue to strive to life a Christian life in imitation of Jesus.  Through Baptism we enter into the Body of Christ and through our perseverance we follow Christ to the end in charity.  \nI have demonstrated in this exchange throughout that Christ both before and after the resurrection did not fail to choose women for ordained ministry because of some societal norms or issues, but rather because it was not his plan as God.  I have stated that men and women have equal but differing roles in the Church and society.  I have argued from historical practice, Scripture and magisterial teaching on the issue to show how your position does not have a leg to stand upon.  I have researched this and read books by experts in the field of which I have referenced a couple in the thread.  Furthermore, when the Anglican Church was considering this novelty in the 1970s, they asked for the opinion of Pope Paul VI who wrote this was not a possibility. Pope John Paul II wrote eloquently and definitively on the issue.  Both were extremely clear on this issue and if you are interested you can download and read both of them from the Vatican or other websites.  \nAfter all my research and reading over the years, all you can come to me with this unsupported, circular reasoning: “it doesn’t go against the wishes of the Risen Christ because his Holy Spirit is really calling some Christian women to be priest.”   Let me get this right and correct me if I am misstating your position.  It doesn’t go against the wishes of the risen Christ because of an unsupported claim – God is calling women to the priesthood!  Does the magisterium agree with your opinion?  No.  Do you have any Scriptural support for your view?  No!  Do you have any previous practice of the Church to support your opinion?  No.  It’s true because you have stated it!  \nThen you make the biggest blunders in all your unsupported statements: “the Holy Spirit know very well that it would have been TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE in the first century A.D.”  You further state this is the ONLY reason women were not chosen by God sooner.  This is a ludicrous statement because of the Scriptural injunction: “with God all things are possible.”  If nothing is impossible for God, in what way is this impossible for God.  In light of this Scriptural rule (God is the Creator and can do as he pleases), in what way would it be impossible for God not to call women to a leading role in the Church?  And this is ONLY reason, you say?  You provide no support for your unsubstantiated statement because there is none.  \nIn light of your failure to support any statement you have made, I ask this of you: either support your opinions or just stop arguing and state you believe it no matter the evidence that contradicts the veracity of your claim.  In light of your lack of support for Church practice and teaching, it would seem your disagreement with the Church is a dangerous opinion for you to take.  It’s not dangerous in and of itself, but if this is how you figure out whom to believe, what other teachings of the Church do you so carelessly disregard?  I do not ask to shame you, but out of concern for your welfare, my friend.  \nI ask you to consider the evidence and consider upon what rests your opinion.  I have considered the basis from which my belief on the issue comes and have attempted to state it clearly.  If you pin your hopes on Gal 3:28 (I realize this is not your argument) which has nothing to do with the liturgical practice, you will have to take into consideration the other of Paul’s statements in which he does limit the participation of women in liturgy.  \nGodspeed,\nAndy\n\n","date":"November 26, 2012 at 10:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"Dave ~ With respect to your point of view, there are theological objections which is the precise reason why there will never be females ordained in the Catholic Church.

Survey results are often vastly different between Catholics who do and do not regularly attend Mass.\nThe poll surveyed 497 Catholics from Feb. 27 to March 4, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percent for questions asked of Catholics.\nIn the release announcing the poll’s results, Quinnipiac provided figures for several questions pertinent to Catholics in America. Most of these were issues particular to Catholics, and the answers were broken down so that readers could compare the differences between those Catholics who attend religious services weekly and less than weekly.\nHowever the question asking about support or opposition to same-sex marriage did not have this distinction, merely showing Catholics as a whole.\nRadocchio explained the discrepancy, telling CNA that the question about same-sex marriage was asked in the “general issues section” of the poll, and the question was posed to all registered voters.\n“We reported them with the breakdowns we generally used with registered voter releases,” she explained.\nShe said that the remaining questions were all “Catholic issues” which were asked only of Catholic respondents, regardless of their voter registration.\nAmong Catholics who are registered to vote and who attend services weekly, a mere 36 percent support “gay marriage,” while 55 percent oppose it, the poll found. Among those who attend services less than weekly, 63 percent support “gay marriage” and 29 percent oppose it.\nThe margin of error for those figures is plus or minus 4.7 percent. Fewer than 497 Catholics were asked the question, because not all of the Catholic respondents were registered voters, though Radocchio said the number of Catholic respondents about “gay marriage” was “not much less” than 497.\nBrown told CNA that the breakdown of the same-sex “marriage” results was not in the initial poll release because “we only have so much space, and can only do so many things up front.”\nIt was “certainly not malicious,” he said, and was a “completely benign decision.”\nThe poll also found that while 52 percent of respondents think the Church is “moving in the right direction,” 55 percent think the next Pope “should move the Church in new directions.” Sixty-four percent said the next Pope should “relax the church ban on contraception,” and 62 percent responded that he should support allowing women to become priests.\nThe responses to these questions consistently showed a stark contrast in the opinions of those who attend Mass weekly, and those who attend less than weekly. For example, of those who do not attend services weekly, 73 percent support the priestly ordination of women. Of those who do attend weekly, that figure is only 38 percent.\nDe Solenni said the poll “shows the importance of more effective teaching” in the Church.\nShe noted that “when you ask a question of those who attend Mass regularly, the ratios are almost inverse.”\n“So if they really want to do a survey that has some integrity, let us know what the standard is for identifying someone as Catholic.”\nDe Solenni added that these issues are not of interest solely to Americans, but to Catholics worldwide. “It’s really important that we take a global perspective on this, and look at what people are saying around the world.”\nShe said that polls such as the one conducted by Quinnipiac can be useful in terms of “knowing the audience you’re speaking to” and “how much teaching needs to be done.”\nSuch polls, however, are not helpful guides “in terms of telling us which policies we should pursue.”\nhttp://m.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=26752\n\n","date":"March 10, 2013 at 10:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/09/but-they-didnt-ask-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"But they didn’t ask about the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"Relics according to Catholics cannot be bought or sold, only given away.

I said you needed to be catechized because you are not knowledgeable about the Catholic faith and I did so as charitably as possible in private.  Since you placed that here, it’s no longer private.\nThere’s nothing 21st century or modern about homosexuality.  It is ancient and disordered.  I guess you just call St. Paul ignorant for writing that those who practice such things cannot enter the kingdom of God.  Please note it is the practice that is the sin, not the self-identification.  And the sin is no different than any other sin in that it offends God.  \nIt is a fact that homosexuals generally do not have monogamous relationships with the same person for life, which is precisely it’s definition between one man and woman. But redefining marriage to please those who so demand is absurd. It’s the complementarity of the sexes that produces life.  In other words, only when you have a man and a woman is a child produced.  All children deserve a Mother and Father.  There is no such thing as women or men fulfilling both roles naturally.  Neither of the same sex can produce a child except by taking the missing ingredient from someone else, hence the child needs to know and be raised by both his or her Mother and Father.\nThe change you seek has nothing to do with the Holy Spirit.  The change you seek breaks with the 2000 year Catholic tradition.  The very reason for the name Catholic (universal) is because all believed and practiced the same things.  These beliefs did not include homosexuality or abortion.  Your beliefs inasmuch as they vary with the church’s teachings are not Catholic in any sense of the word as applied to the Catholic Church.\n\n","date":"March 10, 2013 at 10:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/09/but-they-didnt-ask-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"But they didn’t ask about the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"With respect to Calvin’s point of view, I would have to say in fairness it would have to be admitted as is obvious in Scripture (Acts) that these followers of the way were not only rejected, but the leaders of the Jews, of which they were an original part, were thrown into prison and given stripes for speaking in the name of Jesus.  To not publicize the Shroud is not even close to any kind of proof that it is a fake and wasn’t there at the resurrection.  I would point Mr. Calvin to the end of John’s gospel in which the disciple Jesus loved, John, peered into the empty tomb before Peter went in and he came to believe.  What does that mean?  Well, he was there for the crucifixion and was most likely present for the burial.  He saw a dead Jesus enshrouded and then on the third day he saw either a tied Shroud without a body or an untied Shroud with an image on it.  Both of these conclusions to his involvement with Jesus’ crucifixion would certainly cause one to believe.\nThis joined with the possibility that Jude took the Shroud to Edessa early could account for a lack of Scriptural evidence of this event.  It certainly wasn’t core to the resurrection event.  If it was core, obviously it would have been written down by one of them, unless they were instructed not to do so.  The glorified Jesus taught them for some time after the resurrection.\nBased on all these unknowns, I don’t think Calvin’s skepticism can be taken very seriously.\n\n","date":"May 25, 2012 at 1:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/25/calvinists-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Calvinists and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"We have some videos & Schumacher audio on our library page – http://shroudnm.com/library.html.\nRuss Breault has a good audio/video selection – http://www.shrouduniversity.com/\nYou can also use the YouTube Video Channel – http://www.youtube.com/lijkwade/\n\n","date":"May 7, 2013 at 8:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/07/enhance-the-blog/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Enhance the Blog"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"It’s an obvious mistake.

Sure some fringe elements in Christianity expect perhaps to prove the existence of God through the rediscovery of Noah’s ark, for example.  \n2. Concerning the Shroud, with what I know of it, I understand that it is not possible to prove that the image is of Jesus of Nazareth, yet there is much evidence to support that thesis.  There is a world of difference between evidence and proof and I speak of the Shroud’s evidence.  We do not have his DNA for comparison, no driver’s license, dental records or any other way to positively identify Jesus as the man on the cloth with 100% certainty.  There are similarities that are uncanny between the image of the man on the linen and the records of what was done to Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.  But aside from these kinds of things about which Mr. Coyne could read up, I have something else to offer.\nI consider the affect the Shroud has had on those who study it and I offer that as interesting evidence.  One can read my own reflection on its affect on my own life at http://shroudnm.com/, “Why is the Shroud important?,” in either English or Spanish.  Shroud.com also has some great Shroud researchers (I do not include myself in that list, but am more of a generalist and am unsure I have an expertise that I could offer in its study) and their own experiences with the Shroud.  I have heard the effect it has had on some of my friends such as Barrie Schwortz, Dr. John Jackson, Dr. Petrus Soons, Pete Schumacher and Larry Schauff.  I would suggest to Mr. Coyne that he should consider this evidence in his calculations concerning this linen cloth if he chooses.  There’s no doubt he might find that study of interest.\n3. There have been healings and other evidences of inexplicable “miraculous” cures that he perhaps is unaware.  There is a lady in Italy who has no corneas, yet can see.  I would love to hear a rational explanation for this inexplicable event in this woman’s life.\n4. I can state unequivocally that my prayers have been answered over my years.  But I am unsure that Mr. Coyne can test those in a lab or in reason, yet I have no doubt whatever what has happened in my life.  The mere fact that I remain vertical and breathing is proof there is a God, in my estimation.  I can cite several instances in my life from which I should not have been able to recover, yet I am still here living on this patch of earth.\n5. There are things that exist, such as the winding staircase in a decommissioned church in Santa Fe, NM which was built and is a marvel.  No one knows who built it and it is built using techniques that are perhaps uncommon to human engineering.  There are no nails.  (I am not an engineer, so I cannot claim these methods are unknown.)\nIf I were to posit “proof” for the existence of God (which I would not do anyway since I prefer evidence), I would offer the complexity of the human body, the complexity of the earth and all its preciseness and the truth of the Big Bang and the expanding universe and its implication that in order to have a big bang, logically there has to have been a first cause.\n\n","date":"June 28, 2012 at 2:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/28/noahs-ark-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-grand-canyon/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Noah’s Ark, the Shroud of Turin and the Grand Canyon"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"Do you mean smug?

What is the point?  There has to be much more behind this than the writer has admitted.\nTo write it with a small ‘c’ means ‘universal’ as in Christian, so this would be directed at all Christians, not just Catholics with a capital ‘C’ as in Roman (Latin) or Eastern Catholic, for example.  While this might be a technical distinction, it is not without meaning.  Catholic in this sense means a Christian who is in communion with the Bishop of Rome as the earthy head of the Church Jesus invested in Peter.  So with great respect for you, my friend and brother, Dan, I would have to disagree with your application of the capital ‘C’ to yourself if you are not in communion with the the earthly head established by Christ.  You are no doubt catholic.\nAs to the dating to which he refers, this dating was proven to be falsely attributed to the Shroud itself, but only to a small repair area proven through textile expert studies by Sue Benford and her husband Joe Marino and chemically by Ray Rogers and others.

Further, the study is flawed due to the wording “convinced atheist.”  Why is there a need for a modifier to atheist?  Perhaps these are two different categories that need differentiation.

No one in our advanced technological age can even come close to recreating most, much less all of the features of the Shroud.\nOn image 13 the following appears: 3-D – This is a computer recreation of the face image. The computer assumed that the image was determined by the distance between the body and a parallel plane. \nComments: This is not a computer recreation.  Rather, it is the VP8 Image Analyzer processing the image and producing a brightness map of the face which is an accurate 3D representation despite the fact that the VP8 does not make 3D images.

Since the earliest letter is most likely from St. Paul in about 49AD (1 Thessalonians) and Jesus was crucified about 29-33AD, I would say it’s quite obvious the Shroud came first.  Of course the gospel message is not contingent upon the Shroud, rather the Shroud is a supplement and perhaps evidence for the events themselves which are borne witness by many eye witnesses.\nAs to Stephen’s first posting as revealed by Dan here, the evidence on the Shroud would be consistent with the information in the New Testament if the Shroud were to be considered authentic.  I am unaware of any inconsistency between the eye-witness accounts and the information on the Shroud.  This kind of statement does not necessarily imply any biblical literalism not does it endanger Christian belief is the Shroud were to be proven a hoax.\n\n","date":"June 16, 2013 at 10:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/16/which-came-first-the-gospels-or-the-shroud/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Which Came First, the Gospels or the Shroud?"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"I suppose if you cannot trust anything in a blog, you might want to consider closing down and doing something different.\nWhat interests me most about this is to know the background of the one(s) who wrote it.  But let me think about what is written and what it might indicate.\nClaiming it is a 33 year-old man gives away the traditional belief that Jesus was about 33 when crucified.  If that is the writer’s belief, then most likely this is a Christian or one who accepts this idea.\nSince the Vatican has never made the claim, obviously this is not written by a Catholic, or at least not a Catholic who knows anything about the Catholic Church.  It could be a misunderstanding what what the Church has said.\nI am unsure the weave of the cloth proves or indicates anything of the sort.  Unless I am mistaken, herringbone weave was not used exclusively in the first century AD.\nThe signs of blood does offer proof that this man was crucified.  This is a certainty of which Yannick has shown to be irrefutable.  \nI really like the final question.  If this isn’t the burial cloth of Christ, what happened to it?  I think there is much wisdom in this question for if Jesus was the Messiah, then wouldn’t the burial cloth be kept with reverence and not just discarded?\nDue to this little evaluation of the questions and what could be behind them, with all due respect for him as a person, I would have to disagree with daveb’s assessment of the snippet.\n\n","date":"July 29, 2012 at 10:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/29/why-you-should-not-trust-what-you-read-in-blogs/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Why you should not trust what you read in blogs"},{"author":"andy_weiss","post":"If you ever get a chance to listen to Dr. Soons’ presentation, you should take the opportunity.

Perhaps we ought to try to be charitable towards one another, or simply give each other the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise.  \nI was cautioned when I got involved with the Shroud through creating the website that there are those who are not civil in the Shroud ‘world’.  Presuming this is Jesus, the Prince of Peace, this is a terrible irony (I believe from the evidence I have seen and the tremendous affect it has had on my life personally, but hold no ill will toward those who do not believe similarly, rather I only wish them the best).  Each person should be permitted to hold their own beliefs about this and many other subjects.  The world is a big place and there is room enough for diversity of personal opinion on this and many other subjects. After all, we are human.
