Probably only 20% of the academics I have encountered have been truly open minded and relatively free of dogmatic positions. \nI am now very skeptical about the weight given to “Experts”.\nI strongly suspect that Charles’ skepticism with regard to the Shroud as influencing what he writes. Or else he is simply not looking at things from all angles in a balanced way (ie. see my comments on the other post about his comments on the “boldness” of artistic representations suggesting that the Shroud was originally much bolder)\nWhat frustrates me most about him is that he rarely acknowledges valid potential alternative theories.\n\n","date":"October 24, 2014 at 1:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/the-guardian-notes-the-history-today-article-by-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"The Guardian Notes the History Today Article by Charles Freeman"}],"researchers":[{"author":"emma08","post":"“sorry for the supernatural fans out there”.
