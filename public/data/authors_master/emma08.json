Probably only 20% of the academics I have encountered have been truly open minded and relatively free of dogmatic positions. I am now very skeptical about the weight given to “Experts”.I strongly suspect that Charles’ skepticism with regard to the Shroud as influencing what he writes. Or else he is simply not looking at things from all angles in a balanced way (ie. see my comments on the other post about his comments on the “boldness” of artistic representations suggesting that the Shroud was originally much bolder)What frustrates me most about him is that he rarely acknowledges valid potential alternative theories.","date":"October 24, 2014 at 1:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/the-guardian-notes-the-history-today-article-by-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"The Guardian Notes the History Today Article by Charles Freeman"}],"researchers":[{"author":"emma08","post":"“sorry for the supernatural fans out there”. So you don’t believe in the supernatural Yannick? Therefore you don’t believe in the resurrection?If you believe in the resurrection then you can’t dismiss the possibility of a supernatural explanation for the Shroud.I for one am open to naturalistic explanations. but am also open to supernatural ones. As long as I retain faith in the resurrection of Christ, that won’t change.","date":"June 17, 2015 at 1:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/14/stephen-jones-on-the-thomas-de-wesselow-presentation/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones on the Thomas De Wesselow Presentation"},{"author":"emma08","post":"Not that I have any expertise in this area, and have read only moderately in this area, but I thought Matthew was aimed at the Jews, rather than Gentiles","date":"June 16, 2015 at 12:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/14/stephen-jones-on-the-thomas-de-wesselow-presentation/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones on the Thomas De Wesselow Presentation"}]}
