This comparison between a shift from 35,000 years to 50,000 years on the one hand, and a shift from 700 years to 2000 years on the other hand, is simply inadequate. In a sample of age 700, about 88% of the 14C atoms still survive; in a sample of age 2,000, about 70% of the original 14C atoms did not decay. Ir order to push up the percentage from 70% to 88%, and using a recent biocarbon source with 100% of the 14C still present, about 60% of the original carbon in the sample has to be replaced by contamination mechanisms of all sorts. Of course, this replacement percentage of 60% becomes larger still when the contamination is produced by older carbon, dating from the 16th century, for example.\nBut in a sample of age 50,000 y, only 0,00155% of the 14C atoms survive (taking the half life = 5,700 y). In a sample of 35,000 y, 0,215% of the 14C survives. Suppose that we use contamination material of age 5,700 y (36% of the 14C still present). Then we need to replace only 0,55% of the carbon in the sample to produce a ‘rejuvenation’ from 50,000y=>35,000y.\nOf course, these are only some back-of-the-envelope calculations but they illustrate the main problem: in very old samples, contamination can easily have a huge impact on the age measurement, because there is only very few 14C left. But in ‘young’ samples (‘young’ a compared to the half life of 14C) it is much more difficult to significantly alter the measured age by contamination.\n\n","date":"February 19, 2013 at 5:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/13/special-paper-chase-new-possibilities-why-the-c14-dating-of-the-shroud-may-be-wrong/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"SPECIAL PAPER CHASE: New Possibilities Why the C14 Dating of the Shroud May Be Wrong"},{"author":"jos_verhulst","post":"I will keep repeating that this piece has been handed to the Arizona lab for dating, and not for shelfing in some mysterious drawer. \nIt has been stated that there is a problem with the shroud sample used for the dating of the Shroud, because the results of measurements done at the three labs suggest linear variation of the age measured as a function of the place where the measurement is done. \nThe Arizona piece offers a possibility to check this statement.

The Maillard hypothesis proposes a cause for the image that could operate as well on other shrouds; there is no reason why this unique image should happen to be the image of Christ, no less. Neither does this hypothesis, or other hypotheses of the same grain, explain why the image is so surprisingly complete. A viable hypothesis has to take into account, in one way or another, the fact that the image on the Shroud is not the image of some random person, but a complete image of Christ (or at least of somebody sharing a plethora of characteristics with Christ). It is because the image refers to Christ that it can be interpreted as a *sign*, namely as a sign of the ressurection, and a viable theory on the image should explain this particular aspect of the image. Consider also the following. The fact that the image is unique implies that the windows for the physico-chemical conditions needed for its production are very narrow; otherwise more such images should be known. But the conditions (ventilation, gravity, pressure of the body on the Shroud…) were certainly different at the upper side resp. the lower side of the body. Nevertheless, the quality of the image is about equal for both sides of the body. The explanation of the image should account for the fact that (a) this is the image of Christ (or a lookalike) and (b) the image is complete and its quality is about equal for both sides of the body. The Maillard theory fails on all these points.\n\n","date":"September 19, 2012 at 2:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/18/latest-on-david-rolfes-site-on-maillard-reaction/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Latest on David Rolfe’s Site on Maillard Reaction"},{"author":"jos_verhulst","post":"For those who need it: http://www.pdfunlock.com/\n\n","date":"October 5, 2012 at 7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/05/paper-chase-lavoies-paper-from-frascati/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase: Lavoie’s Paper from Frascati"},{"author":"jos_verhulst","post":"But there nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong, with this lacking of a ‘consensus’.

Basically, Christ and his followers (and also groups such as the Samaritans and some Essenes) used the original Mosaic pre-exile Jewish calendar and held their passover meal according to that calendar. At the temple, the modified post-exile and ‘official’ calendar was used. The synoptic gospels refer to the non-offical calendar, as is stated implicitely in Marc 14:12 (see Humphreys p.152 ff). The fact that John refers (11:55), not simply to ‘the Passover’, but to the ‘Jewish Passover’, indicates, according to Humphreys (p.162 ff), that he refers to the ‘official’ calendar. The ‘last supper’ was on Wednesday April 1st, 33, that was Passover day according to the pre-exile calendar. I highly recommend the book by Humphreys; the whole argument is impossible to summarize here.\nAs to the birthday of Jezus, it should be noted that the gospels seem to relate two different births. For instance, the genealogies in Matt.1 and Luke 3 are different, and the stories in both these gospels have but very few common elements. The possibility should be considered, that there where indeed two births. According to the esoteric christian tradition represented f.i. by the flemish painter P.P.Rubens, there are even three time points that should be taken into account: Tuesday 15 september 7 BC, 18:10; Friday 14 january 1 AD, 21u05; and Sunday 25 december 1 AD, especially 23u50 (local time, Jerusalem & surroundings, julian calendar).\n\n","date":"May 26, 2012 at 10:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/26/quake-reveals-day-of-jesus-crucifixion-or-something-like-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quake Reveals Day of Jesus’ Crucifixion (or something like that)"},{"author":"jos_verhulst","post":"For a good illustration of the problems, have a look at this:\n\nThe problem is not so much with the ‘review’ part, but mainly with the ‘peer’ part.\nBeing reviewed by ‘peers’ means being subjected to censorship by those dominating the field. ‘Peer pressure’ or ‘peer control’ is to be avoided.
