Namely, how is it possible to have a perfectly flat image of a supposed jesus of a shroud that was wrapped around a body. If this was a true image then surely the edges of the image would be diffused and stretched rather than showing a perfect 2 dimensional image. Forget about the exactness of Carbon dating which is extremely accurate to a few decades on objects less than 2000 years, just give me a reason as to why the image is so flat and symmetrical ?","date":"June 16, 2011 at 6:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/28/the-archaeology-of-the-bible-by-james-k-hoffmeier/","cat":"books","title":"The Archaeology of the Bible by James K. Hoffmeier"}]}
