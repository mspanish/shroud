Radio carbon tests prove that it isn’t that old, even the carbon monoxide penetrating the fabric doesn’t hold up anymore. there is not one piece of evidence suggesting this was a) that old to begin with b) that the person in the shroud was this infamous Jesus c) that how it was made was a miraculous divine process. Religious folks love to jump to conclusions to protect their beliefs? why are they all so scared?@ Ron – you mention evidence? what evidence?? an unknown explanation is not evidence.  the correct thing too say is “at the moment we can’t quite replicate exactly what made this, however there a several possibilities, this does not imply that it is miraculous” – so in essence you say “we don’t know yet”.  not jump to conclusions – because that is Gullible. I imagine you consider the Catholic church holding it as evidence that is true right?? ;-) the catholic church wouldn’t mislead anyone would they now?? LOLThe only, yes only piece of substantial evidence was the dating which all three science laboratories confirmed. All hypothesis about it being incorrect (increase carbon affecting age) have been tested and non till date are showing any effect on the dating processes. Unfortunately some people have a very weak burden of proof to accept claims.","date":"December 21, 2011 at 3:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/21/the-turin-shroud-of-turin-may-be-authentic-get-over-it/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Turin Shroud of Turin may be authentic, get over it."}]}
