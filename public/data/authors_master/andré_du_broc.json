{"opinion":[{"author":"andré_du_broc","post":"Dan- I should point out that the bride’s parents were very nice people. I, myself grew up Catholic and spent twelve years in Catholic Schools. If you read my blog regularly you’d know how those many years in Catholic School have shaped my point of view. I have met many admirable Catholics, whose unflappable faith is certainly enviable to an old cynic like myself. I’ve also met some that didn’t seem very Christlike and didn’t embrace what is best about the Catholic faith, a belief that we can, through the power of our faith, attain redemption.  Good luck to you during the hurricane and keep writing. – André\n\n","date":"August 28, 2011 at 11:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/28/pew-shaped-hineys-and-feigned-enlightenment-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Pew-Shaped Hineys and Feigned Enlightenment About the Shroud of Turin"}]}
