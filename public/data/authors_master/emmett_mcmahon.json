I believe the Shroud of Turin to be the burial cloth of of Jesus Christ.  I had a little help. From who ?? My Guardian Angel.  A few words about my Guardian Angel. My first recall of my Guardian Angel – I was about 9 to 10 years old and the family, me included were on vacation at a small lake in Indiana.  I was playing in the lake in an inner tube at the small beach area that people swam at.  I seen more members of the family had arrived at the beach and I decided to get out of the inner tube and go to be with them. I did not realise that I had drifted further out into the lake and the water was several feet over my head and I did not know how to swim.  I threw my arms and hands over my head to slip down out of the inner tube to walk up to the beach from the water.  The water was maybe 10-15 feet deep and I no longer had the inner tube and could not swim and was literally in over my head. I tried to grab on to anything above me but there was nothing there so all I was doing was flailing mfield nex to y arms and my hands were out of the water sometimes.  I knew I was in trouble –  I then heard a voice inside my head that told that “You are going to die – Say your prayers”.  I was confused as I knew a few prayers but didn’t know which one to say say first.  Next thing in realise is that inside my mind I am saying the Lords Prayer also known as the Our Father.  I then saw pinkish or reddish colored clouds and then I had an image of the field nes to out house that was up in Michigan. and then the voice told me that this was all I was going to remember.  The next thing I know is that I am laying on a towel on my stomach on the beach and my brother 10 years older than me was pushing on my back.  The towel was wet under my face and there was a lot of mucus (snot) on my nose and lips.  My brother had performed CPR on me and I was alive.  I also now realise that I had an NDE but was told not to remember most of it. \nAnother strong interaction with My Guardian Angel happened in early 1964, I was in the USMC and my 4 years of active duty was almost over.  A couple of older more senior guys that I knew told me that when I re-enlisted I would be promoted to Sgt. E-5  (I was then a Crpl e-4).  Originally I was going to leave the Marines and go back to Michigan as I was stationed at the MCRD here in San Diego. So I started thinking about re-enlisting but I heard that voice say “do not re-enlist” . I didn’t think much about it and just continued living my daily life.  I thought about  I was reminded by one of the guys about being promoted on my reenlistment and heard the voice say the same again,  I ignored it and continued on with my daily life.  A few days later I was told by one of the Sgts at The headquarters building that I needed to “get on the stick’ and tell them That I was ready to re-enlist.  I thought about that  and then as I was seriously thinking of of taking the required action, that voice was very stern and loud inside my head “DO NOT RE-ENLIST”.  So I did not reenlist.  On Feb. 17th I left active duty in the Marine Corps. Well history tells us what happened for the next following several years. The war in Viet Nam.  With in a year I was married and never back on active duty, was released from the inactive reserves after 2 years and was a full blown civilian.  Alive.\nDuring the last few years I have been following the Shroud of Turin and had signed up to this site.  One day I was looking at a couple of the images of the Shroud that showed how it looked in it’s natural state and then what the 3-D imaging showed and then I heard some words in my head head telling me that this was the “real picture of the living Jesus Christ”. I accepted that it was my Guardian Angel consciously communicating with me again. While reading one of the articles I read about the ?Prince of Peace”, I looked it up and sure enough, my insides tell me the same thing – that this is a painting of the Living Jesus\nChrist.  I am a believer. You don’t know me but all I can say is to take my Guardian Angels words for it as I do. Peace and love to all of you.\n\n","date":"November 13, 2014 at 5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/13/over-at-history-todays-blog-space/","cat":"history","title":"Over at History Today’s blog space"},{"author":"emmett_mcmahon","post":"The translated article was not the easiest to read but it was not really that difficult.

Sometime back – not sure of the month, day or even the year.  I had read about the Shroud and my remembrance is that on the 3rd day after Christ was placed into the tomb, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb to try and anoint the body of Jesus with spices.   Instead of finding Roman guards at a sealed tomb, she found the guards gone and the tomb opening was open as the large rock had been rolled to the side of the opening.  She entered the tomb and found that the area where the body of Christ was supposed to be was empty of the body. She was confounded and ran back to the room(s) where the Apostles were and reported the fact of the missing body too them.  A couple of the Apostles and the Disciple Mary Magdalene returned to the grave and observed the fact that there was no body.  My problem is that I don’t recall whether Mary took the Burial Shroud with her from her 1st visit or it was picked up by one of the Apostles upon their entrance of the tomb to investigate. \nThe Apostles and close Disciples kept tight control of the Shroud and it was passed on to their followers for many centuries. The Shroud has the remnants of the blood, sweat and dirt that was left on it from the burial and also the metaphysical image of the body that was created and remains from the exact time that the physical body was energized by the spiritual soul of our Lord at the time of his resurrection.\n\n","date":"November 15, 2014 at 6:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"author":"emmett_mcmahon","post":"Hi, this is not what I had read but it is close enough as far as my memory can tell. http://www.netbiblestudy.com/00_cartimages/Miracle%20of%20the%20Undisturbed%20Grave%20Clothes%20oif%20Jesus.pdf\nI know that from a TV program I had watched that the Vatican does not want any more testing done of the actual Shroud but it would answer most questions if a few square inches could be removed from a couple of areas of the Shroud near to the image but not cutting into the image itself – well maybe some of the “soul emplaced image” but not the part of the direct body image area. ??

I should have said St. Juan Diego.\n\n","date":"April 28, 2014 at 4:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/21/youtube-of-barrie-schwortz-on-coast-to-coast-am/","cat":"video","title":"YouTube of Barrie Schwortz on Coast to Coast AM"}]}
