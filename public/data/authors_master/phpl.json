This paper recounts the initial doubts about the validity of the C-14 results; the history behind the patch theory; the abundant historical and scientific information support of the theory, especially from the  findings of the late Ray Rogers in his paper published in 2005 after his direct examination of the C-14 samples compared with other samples from the main cloth; independent confirmations of Rogers’ findings; criticisms of Rogers’ findings; and refutations of these criticisms.

I at first observed the players and the casino staff and decided to start gambling. As soon as I started to gamble , I also started to win. It was incredible, after a while I had gained more than three thousand dollars. A guy that I met some time before at a business meeting began to chat with me. I told him that I came here with one thousand dollars and had now tripled this amount. He smiled at me, congratulated me , and asked me to lend him five hundred dollars. I was a little bit annoyed by his demand, but accepted. I continued to play and by midnight I had won more than six thousand dollars. I couldn’t believe it. The same guy again started to talk with me, and once more asked me to lend him five hundred dollars. I hesitated, but he was a charming fellow and I accepted to lend him this amount.   Luck sometimes visits a fool, but it never sits down with him  and by the end of the day I had lost everything. As the casino was closing the guy came to talk to me for a third time and I told him what had happened. He looked at me and said “I knew by experience how this was going to end , that’s why I asked you to lend me this money .

Just to name a few clear-cut examples :\n” In 1986, reviewing Ian Wilson’s Evidence of the Shroud for the Christchurch Press, I predicted that if the cloth ever were to be carbon-dated it would come in at A.D. 1335, plus or minus 30 years. When the Shroud was finally dated and the results came back from the participating laboratories, the collated result was A.D. 1325, plus or minus 65 years. I was ten years off ” (Dennis Dutton)\n ” I believe the ‘Shroud’ was painted by an artist shortly before it first appeared in history in 1356, say 1355 to allow a year ‘for the paint to dry.’ There is NO blood on the ‘Shroud.’ That was my position by January 1, 1980 and I have maintained that position at every opportunity since.”  (Walter Mc Crone)\n” …the shroud was created by an artist near the time it was first publicly introduced around 1353  ” (Joe Nickell – 1983)\n\n","date":"April 2, 2015 at 8:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"phpl","post":"“Are you aware that the AIM is a product of your fancy and/or wishful thinking ?”\nShroudstory.com  or fancystory.com  ?\n\n","date":"April 4, 2015 at 2:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"phpl","post":"“I would hazard a guess that even a toy microscope would be an instrument of mystery to Frau Flury-Lemberg”\ndaveb should send a toy microscope and a personal memo  to Mrs Flury-Lemberg by express courier.

He personally conducted over 25,000 autopsies in his capacity as a Forensic Pathologist, to determine the Identity and exact cause of death of the “Man on the Shroud.”\nHe conducted an autopsy on the Shroud of Turin for STURP, and described the wounds of “The Man on the Shroud” in minute detail. His full findings may be read on http://shroud.com/bucklin.htm He positively identified the Man on the Shroud as Jesus Christ, and Crucifixion as the means of execution.\nA summary of Dr Robert Bucklin’s research on the Body of the Man on the Shroud is as follows: \n———————————————-\n1. The body was approximately 5ft 11inches tall.\n2. The body weighed approximately 175 pounds.\n3. The body was anatomically well developed and normal.\n4. The body had stiffened in Rigor Mortis.\n5. The body had long hair, and a short beard.\n6. The body had multiple puncture wounds over the entire scull area.\n7. The body had an abrasion at the tip of the nose.\n8. The right cheek was distinctly swollen.\n9. Rounded foreign objects can be seen over the right and left eyes.\n10. There is a large blood stain over the right chest area, consistent with the post mortem wound to the chest.\n11. There is a penetrating skin wound in the right chest wall produced by a sharp puncturing instrument.\n12. The blood flows from the injuries in the wrist indicate that the victim died with his hands raised about 65 degrees from the horizontal.\n13. The body had been nailed through both wrists.\n14. Only four fingers are visible of both hands, suggesting injury to the Median nerve of both wrists.\n15. The body had been nailed through both feet.\n16. The left foot had been flexed over the right foot before nailing.\n17. There are a series of traumatic injuries which extend from the shoulder areas to the lower portion of the back, and down to the backs of the calves. These images are dumbbell-shaped imprints, applied possibly by a whip.\n18. There is abrasion and denuding of the skin over the right and left shoulder blade area consistent with a heavy object, like a beam resting over the shoulders.\n19. The whip injuries occurred earlier than the other injuries.\n20. Had been scourged with His hands above His heads, by two separate soldiers.\n21. The victim was executed in an upright position with His arms extended upwards.\n22. A Crucifixion type posture would be the most plausible explanation for these findings.\n23.The wound in the right side released a watery type fluid from the body cavities as well as blood from the heart area.\n24. The Man on the Shroud died of postural asphyxia as the result of His position during the Crucifixion.\n25. There is also evidence of severe blood loss from the skin wounds, as well as fluid accumulation in the chest cavities related to terminal cardio-respiratory failure.\n26. In the case of Man on the Shroud, the forensic pathologist will have information relative to the circumstances of death by Crucifixion which he can support by his anatomical findings.\n27. The forensic pathologist will be aware that the Individual Whose Image is depicted on the cloth has undergone:\n– Puncture injuries to His wrists and feet\n– Puncture injuries to His head\n– Multiple traumatic whip-like injuries to His back\n– Post mortem puncture injury to His chest area which has released both blood and a water type of fluid.\nDr Robert Bucklin concluded, “From this data it is not an unreasonable conclusion for the forensic pathologist to determine that only One Person in history has undergone this sequence of events. That Person is Jesus Christ.”\n===================================\n3.   “The body was anatomically well developed and normal”\n        False. No ears, no navels, right arm is  too long, right hand is too long, forehead is too     small,  et cetera.\n13. “The body had been nailed through both wrists.” \n       False. We can see only one wrist.\n15. “The body had been nailed through both feet.”\n       False. We don’t even see the feet.\n16.  “The left foot had been flexed over the right foot before nailing.”\n        False. We don’t even see the feet.\n 20  “Had been scourged with His hands above His heads, by two separate soldiers.”\n         Did Bucklin view the scene ?

Believers in authenticity or “Shroudies” as they sometimes call themselves, have always been very vocal and expansive. They have tried to demonstrate by whatever means one can imagine of (controversial scientific tests, weird hypothesis, conspiracy theory, inept mathematical reasoning, biased research, et cetera) that the Shroud of Turin wrapped the body of Jesus Christ. Scientists have better things to do than to study an old cloth whose medieval origin was already written on the walls prior to that monstrous radiocarbon testing.\nThat being said, I don’t have anything personal against shroudies and would be happy to invite any of them   to a good restaurant and discuss with them whilst  enjoying  a good meal and drink .
