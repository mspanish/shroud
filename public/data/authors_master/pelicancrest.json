There are many links on the Internet to articles about him/his publications. His father Dr. James Charney is a psychologist in New Haven, Conn. His mother Diane Joy Charney is a professor of French at Yale. Noah, born 1979, has his own webpage and a Wikipedia entry. There are also a number of internet links about his mother. Noah’s focus is on art crime, but I believe his areas of interest include forgeries. I recently bought Noah Charney’s book about The Ghent Altarpiece/Mystic Lamb. I find the Templar member Charney to be an interesting coincidence. Best, pelicancrest Distant great granddaughter of the Rev.

Your facts aren’t quite correct. I was very wrong in not putting the author’s name into the first paragraph, the very first time. Instead, I hid her real name under the moniker Lisa, as a not too veiled reference to Mona Lisa, the crux of Dan Brown’s fictional The Da Vinci Code. I was working towards a slow reveal, as I explained, and the very, very Catholic Achenblog got very antsy with my repeated posts (the week before Easter that particular year) about the sex abuse scandal within the Catholic Church, not to mention the work this author had done uncovering the sex abuses Catholic priests unleashed on children hundreds of years ago. I had no intention of taking credit for this material–but was going to reveal her work at that week’s end. My shame is not mentioning her name from the get go. I did apologize to her, Let’s hope that the Washington Post can come up with a better commenting system, other than one which is based on worth by the number of clicks–quantity rather than any meaningful sense of quantity.

However, one must realize that Texas is the largest state in the Lower 48. “The sun rises and the sun sets and we ain’t out of Texas yet.” There’s a whole lot of real estate between San Antonio and West, Texas, up Interstate 35–New Braunfels (formerly Neu Braunfels), San Marcos, Austin, Round Rock, and so on. The explosion received a lot of press coverage in the Dallas Ft. Worth paper, the Austin newspaper, our San Antonio Express News. National media came to Texas, but another bigger story grabbed national attention (I forget the issue, and would have to look it up), and the cable and major news networks weren’t on site in Texas for too long a time. That, plus, the national media outlets are primarily on the East Coast and Atlanta. An Austin based writer, Stephen Harrigan, wrote recently a great deal about West, but his topic was the Czech community and the Texas gas station kolache wars. The explosion was a sight, since some individuals in West captured the video on their cameras and cell phones. The after photos were pretty awful, too..","date":"2014-02-19","mins":"5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/brief-message-to-joel-achenbach-washington-post-re-your-hijacked-posting-on-pseudoscience-and-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"chatroom","title":"Brief message to Joel Achenbach, Washington Post, re your hijacked posting on pseudoscience and the Turin Shroud"}]}
