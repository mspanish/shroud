It was just an intense reaction I had immediately at that point in the narrative, and from reading other comments lots of people did.  However, like you, I told myself that he probably even just pointed in the general area where he saw the “markers” as really little children are prone to doing without giving much thought to the exact place because… why would he?  It was just…  I don’t know.  I wish that this “error” wasn’t in the book or that they had corrected it, or written some sort of disclaimer, because as it is it looks like a mistake.  It’s surmountable for me, after really thinking about it.  It may not be for some people, especially those who come at it from a place of scepticism to begin with.\n\n","date":"March 29, 2012 at 1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"susana","post":"My moment of doubt while reading the book (which I loved, by the way) was when Colton explained where Jesus’ “markers” were located.  His dad says that he pointed to the palms of his hands as well as the tops of his feet.  That’s when I thought, OK, they’ve fed him all this stuff, maybe without even realizing it.  The shroud shows the wounds to be on the wrists, which is the forensically correct position.  If Colton really claimed to have seen the wounds on the palms of Jesus’ hands then we have a problem.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2012 at 1:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}],"dating":[{"author":"susana","post":"Dawkins doesn’t have the qualifications to carry out this work.  He’s simply a biologist a little too in love with a theory that while elegant and absolutely valid, is not meant to answer every question in the universe.  Moreover, he lacks a little something called impartiality.  Someone as stubborn as Dawkins does not really have a scientific mind able to accept the possibility that he doesn’t know or understand something and to try to look for other answers.  Why in the world would any of us care what he thinks?\n\n","date":"March 30, 2012 at 9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/30/a-20000-shroud-of-turin-challenge-to-richard-dawkins/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A £20,000 Shroud of Turin Challenge to Richard Dawkins"}],"events":[{"author":"susana","post":"I will continue to assert that Dawkins is merely an adequate academic, not a brilliant one by any stretch of the imagination.

If he continues to debate truly brilliant minds he will lose the most significant part of his income, and that’s all there is to that.

Yes, there are times when what He does escapes our logic and we may even shake our fist at him.  I have.  But only for a moment.  Then we remind ourselves that we trust Him with all our heart and soul.  We have to believe that His reasoning is far superior to ours and encompasses knowledge that we don’t possess.  \nI have also struggled with that passage, and many others (from my 21st century sensibilities, I can’t even stand the passages about animal sacrifice), but then I remind myself that I firmly believe that God not only has all the attributes that I just listed, but I also believe that He exists in the eternal present and has knowledge of what has happened and what will happen at any point in history.  As such, I believe His decisions are always wise and correct, though I may not understand them or agree with them.\nAnother aspect of this we have to remember as people of faith is that we are not to put so much stock in this earthly life.  We get all tied up in a knot because people lost their lives and normally we would do anything to preserve life, but according to God’s plan as I understand it, this is not the life we’re supposed to value.  Just because many innocents died that day, it doesn’t mean they were obliterated.  I trust in a God of infinite justice who will ultimately save all the innocents who have died to this life, throughout history.  They will have eternal life.\nIt’s like I said; you can choose to believe or not believe, you can choose to trust or not to trust, but if you do believe, and if you do trust, then believe and trust wholeheartedly.  Trust that God knows what He’s doing.  Dawkins wouldn’t understand that because he doesn’t believe in God, but those of us who do can’t resort to the same kind of materialistic reasoning that Dawkins uses.  If we do that, then really, what’s the difference between us?\n\n","date":"April 1, 2012 at 3:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins"}],"misc":[{"author":"susana","post":"“Christians simply refuse to accept any scientific evidence this is a fake and use it often as evidence for Jesus existence.”\nHe also forgot a little thing called an apostophe there.

I’m not prone to wasting my time like that but the blasphemy they were spouting was so offensive.  They immediately proved they had nothing of substance to argue.
