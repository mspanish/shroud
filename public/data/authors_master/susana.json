His dad says that he pointed to the palms of his hands as well as the tops of his feet. That’s when I thought, OK, they’ve fed him all this stuff, maybe without even realizing it. The shroud shows the wounds to be on the wrists, which is the forensically correct position.

As I said, I loved the book. It was just an intense reaction I had immediately at that point in the narrative, and from reading other comments lots of people did. However, like you, I told myself that he probably even just pointed in the general area where he saw the “markers” as really little children are prone to doing without giving much thought to the exact place because… why would he? It was just… I don’t know. I wish that this “error” wasn’t in the book or that they had corrected it, or written some sort of disclaimer, because as it is it looks like a mistake. It’s surmountable for me, after really thinking about it.

He has latched on to this money maker of an idea and has become the champion of a rhetoric that has little value. He is no fool though, and knows which side his bread is buttered on. If he continues to debate truly brilliant minds he will lose the most significant part of his income, and that’s all there is to that.

Yes, there are times when what He does escapes our logic and we may even shake our fist at him. I have. But only for a moment. Then we remind ourselves that we trust Him with all our heart and soul. We have to believe that His reasoning is far superior to ours and encompasses knowledge that we don’t possess. I have also struggled with that passage, and many others (from my 21st century sensibilities, I can’t even stand the passages about animal sacrifice), but then I remind myself that I firmly believe that God not only has all the attributes that I just listed, but I also believe that He exists in the eternal present and has knowledge of what has happened and what will happen at any point in history. As such, I believe His decisions are always wise and correct, though I may not understand them or agree with them. Another aspect of this we have to remember as people of faith is that we are not to put so much stock in this earthly life. We get all tied up in a knot because people lost their lives and normally we would do anything to preserve life, but according to God’s plan as I understand it, this is not the life we’re supposed to value. Just because many innocents died that day, it doesn’t mean they were obliterated. I trust in a God of infinite justice who will ultimately save all the innocents who have died to this life, throughout history. They will have eternal life. It’s like I said; you can choose to believe or not believe, you can choose to trust or not to trust, but if you do believe, and if you do trust, then believe and trust wholeheartedly. Trust that God knows what He’s doing. Dawkins wouldn’t understand that because he doesn’t believe in God, but those of us who do can’t resort to the same kind of materialistic reasoning that Dawkins uses. If we do that, then really, what’s the difference between us?.","date":"2012-04-01","mins":"3:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins"}],"dating":[{"id":"comment-9788","author":"susana","post":"Dawkins doesn’t have the qualifications to carry out this work. He’s simply a biologist a little too in love with a theory that while elegant and absolutely valid, is not meant to answer every question in the universe. Moreover, he lacks a little something called impartiality. Someone as stubborn as Dawkins does not really have a scientific mind able to accept the possibility that he doesn’t know or understand something and to try to look for other answers.

I found this statement interesting and reminiscent of something I have read somewhere else: “What’s amazing to me is that we’re now at a point where we can plausibly argue that a universe full of stuff came from a very simple beginning, the simplest of all beginnings: nothing.” Oh, right, I know where I’ve seen that before: “Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

I have noticed that particularly on You Tube there seems to be a critical mass of these young air heads. They’re so abysmally unprepared for any intelligent discussion, yet they immediately jump on any pro faith videos that are posted, antagonizing the believers and inciting arguments. I think they’ve assumed that all people of faith are dumb and that there is no need to know anything to prove their superiority of intellect. I recently did engage in a sort of argument with a couple of them. I’m not prone to wasting my time like that but the blasphemy they were spouting was so offensive. They immediately proved they had nothing of substance to argue. I gave up and left them to work their way out of the wet paper bag they’d willingly climbed into. But some people do get really worked up by them and I guess that’s what they’re after. Sigh.
