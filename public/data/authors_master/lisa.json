A few weeks ago I was in a Goodwill store browsing through the book section. A paperback book fell off the shelf. I picked it up, turned it over, read the title, and placed it back on the shelf. If fell off the shelf again! landing right at my feet. This time I looked at the back of the book and read the description. Something about the book said “read me”. I bought the book and read it in a few days. Normally it takes me weeks to read this type of book. But I couldn’t put it down!Years ago I had a NDE, I seldom speak of it for fear of the ridicule I would receive. This book touched those memories and the picture of Jesus is the memory I have of the man I met in “The Garden”. I find comfort and strength again in the knowledge that He is watching over us all.","date":"July 26, 2013 at 2:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"lisa","post":"wow, after reading your post, it’s really funny that you called someone else a “cuckoo clock” your post and findings are not established and sound utterly ridiculous.","date":"August 21, 2011 at 10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
