{"dating":[{"author":"nunya","post":"I think everyone is missing a huge giveaway that the titulus is a fake; and that is the Latin words themselves are wrong: “IESVS NAZERENVS” as it is carved into the wood. Nazerenus is totally the wrong declension of what is should be. It should be Nazereni. The inscribed words say exactly: Jesus Nazareth. Not Jesus OF Nazareth. I find it really hard to believe that if this event was so important for the area, not just to Jesus’s followers, but also Pilate’s status of governor in that territory, that the inscriber would make that great of a grammatical error. It would be like making the mistake of changing George Washington to George OF Washington.\nIt’s not a simple “faith versus science” issue. it’s a “wake up and look at the facts because it’s a fake” issue. The science doesn’t lie… people trying to control mass amounts of people by making up myths do.\n\n","date":"July 11, 2014 at 11:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/22/titulus-crucis-a-fascinating-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Titulus Crucis:  A Fascinating Guest Posting by O.K."}]}
