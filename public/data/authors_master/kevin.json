{"art":[{"author":"kevin","post":"I have been going through some rough times over the past 2 years regarding a child support case.  My current Wife was on the verge of leaving me a couple of times over the situation.  The child I have is from a girlfriend from 14 years ago. Long story short, the mother of the child keeps coming after me, even though I pay child support and health insurance and daycare expense.  The attorney fees are through the roof and I am awaiting my next court date to see if I will have to pay for part of her attorney’s fees, which total 53k, not to mention my own attorney fees. Anyway, I wanted to share my story of struggle and how it has drawn me closer to God.  I do believe this tough situation has happened to me to wake me up and seek Jesus.My Mother is the one who introduced to the  book “Heaven is for real”. I believe she was trying to help comfort me during this tough time in my life. I began to read the book,  over the next couple of months I started to see things more clearly.  When I saw the picture of Jesus in the book, it was breath-taking, what an amazing picture.  It’s beyond words.It made me want to pursue God even more. I found a church in my area and started to go by myself at first, now my Wife and two children go as well. I started to read the Bible at least once a week and bought a childrens Bible for my children.I really do believe that Jesus is right beside us as we go through the very tough times. Regardless of how difficult this past two years have been, I now know Jesus has been there holding me up the entire time.  God bless all of you!","date":"April 26, 2012 at 3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
