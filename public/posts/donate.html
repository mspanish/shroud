   Thanks for looking at our donations page! All Saints could really use your help paying for the costs associated with bringing these 2 fantastic internationally known speakers to our city. We recommend giving a minimum of $10 per person, if you are unable to give please do not feel bad! If you are able to give a little more, please know that you are helping out others and it is greatly appreciated!
