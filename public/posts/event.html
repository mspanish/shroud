Join us for a fascinating evening with Dr. Cheryl White, expert in the Shroud of Turin and co-author of the  <a href="https://manoftheshroud.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Who Is the Man of the Shroud?</a> blog and podcast. We'll be hearing about the history and current research on the Shroud, with a question and answer afterwards. Great opportunity for any Alaskan with an interest in the Holy Shroud!

All Saints Episcopal is sponsoring the event, but we ask that anyone who is able donate a minimum of $10 to help defray the costs of bringing these incredible speakers up to Alaska.
