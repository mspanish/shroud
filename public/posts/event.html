<p>
Join us for a fascinating evening with Dr. Cheryl White, Ph.D and Father Peter Magnum, both experts in the Shroud of Turin. We'll be hearing about the history and current research on the Shroud, with a question and answer afterwards. Great opportunity for any Alaskan with an interest in the Holy Shroud!

All Saints Episcopal is sponsoring the event, but we ask that anyone who is able donate a minimum of $10 to help defray the costs of bringing these incredible speakers up to Alaska.
