	We are excited to have Dr. Cheryl White coming to Alaska this August. Her speaking partner is often Fr. Peter Mangum, who unfortunately will not be able to come this time.  Dr. White and Father Mangum are the authors of a podcast and blog called <a href="https://manoftheshroud.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Who Is the Man of the Shroud?</a>, a well known Shroud resource with over 20 episodes covering a myriad of aspects of the Holy Shroud and the evidence for its authenticity.

	<p>Fr. Peter B. Mangum attended the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he received degrees in theology and canon law.  Ordained for service as a priest in the Diocese of Shreveport in 1990, Fr. Mangum is currently rector of the Cathedral of St. John Berchmans and chaplain to two schools (Pre-K3 - 12). He is also the Judicial Vicar.  He is a member of numerous ecclesial organizations, including the American Confraternity of the Holy Shroud, of which he is the only priest.  Fr. Mangum also belongs to the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, an 800-year old chivalric order pledged to the support of the Holy Land, in which he holds the rank of Knight Commander.  In April of this year, he was granted access to the Vatican Secret Archives for further research related to the Shroud, which is the basis of a forthcoming academic paper.  Fr. Mangum is curator of the new Shroud Exhibit located at the Cathedral of St. John Berchmans.</p>
