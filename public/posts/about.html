		<p>All Saints' Episcopal Church is a community of Christians in the Episcopal Diocese of Alaska; a constitient member of the world-wide Anglican Communion. Our worship of God is grounded in Sacred Scipture and The Book of Common Prayer and our purpose is to glorify God the Holy Trinity on account of the Good News of Jesus Christ.</p> 

		<p>In following Christ, and observing his commandments, we seek to live our lives of faith and repentance under the banner of Christ's Cross and to proclaim him as our one and only Risen Lord and Savior by the power of the Holy Spirit. Our discipleship under Christ is expressed well in the maxim of St Anselm of Canterbury, Credo ut Intelligam (faith seeking understanding) where faith and reason are joined together in the love and service of God and our neighbor. Therefore, we hold to an inquiring faith â€“ a faith that desires to know and share with others, the truth of the Christian Faith. We warmly welcome you to come and see further who we are, and what we are about, as a community of Christ followers here in Anchorage.</p>

		<p>Blessings in Christ,</p>
